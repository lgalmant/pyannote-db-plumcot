bernadette_rostenkowski I like your suit.
penny Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.
howard_wolowitz How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?
leonard_hofstadter She doesn’t flirt with doctors.
penny Yeah. It’s all very professional.
amy_farrah_fowler You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?
penny Okay, good.
bernadette_rostenkowski Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper I started doing it.
raj_koothrappali You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.
raj_koothrappali You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.
penny Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?
sheldon_cooper Why not?
penny You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
leonard_hofstadter I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
raj_koothrappali Yup.
sheldon_cooper I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.
leonard_hofstadter So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.
penny I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…
penny Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm.
penny This is for you.
leonard_hofstadter Huh. What is this?
penny Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.
leonard_hofstadter The one I gave you?
penny Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing.
penny Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right.
penny What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t sound that bad.
penny Well, good, because that’s what I did.
leonard_hofstadter Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.
penny Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.
penny Why?
leonard_hofstadter The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.
penny And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.
leonard_hofstadter Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.
penny Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.
leonard_hofstadter I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.
penny Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t, either.
penny Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Sheldon, you busy?
sheldon_cooper I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.
raj_koothrappali Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
sheldon_cooper Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?
raj_koothrappali So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.
raj_koothrappali It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.
raj_koothrappali Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
sheldon_cooper Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
raj_koothrappali Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.
sheldon_cooper So it’s settled, we’re not doing it.
raj_koothrappali Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
raj_koothrappali Exactly.
sheldon_cooper Very well.
raj_koothrappali So where should we do it?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.
raj_koothrappali Uh, Sheldon…
sheldon_cooper Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you got a sec?
penny Hi. Sure.
leonard_hofstadter I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
penny Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.
penny Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.
penny Mm.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.
penny You know what, that’s great. I love that.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.
penny You two want to be alone?
leonard_hofstadter I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.
penny Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
penny Control issues?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe.
penny Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.
penny You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?
penny Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.
raj_koothrappali Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
amy_farrah_fowler Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.
raj_koothrappali Did you get in?
amy_farrah_fowler No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
sheldon_cooper Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.
raj_koothrappali This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
sheldon_cooper Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked.
raj_koothrappali Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.
sheldon_cooper All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?
amy_farrah_fowler Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time.
raj_koothrappali We’re going to be fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this.
sheldon_cooper Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.
raj_koothrappali I’m sweating already.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.
raj_koothrappali How hot is it?
sheldon_cooper Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees.
raj_koothrappali Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
sheldon_cooper True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks again for having us.
howard_wolowitz Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?
penny Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.
bernadette_rostenkowski I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.
howard_wolowitz I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings.
leonard_hofstadter Well, nailed it.
howard_wolowitz So what did you want to know?
penny Well, do you guys ever fight over money?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.
howard_wolowitz You didn’t have to say so much more.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.
howard_wolowitz I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?
howard_wolowitz For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Without asking me?
howard_wolowitz There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
bernadette_rostenkowski How much, Howie?
howard_wolowitz Not a lot.
bernadette_rostenkowski How much?
howard_wolowitz Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.
bernadette_rostenkowski Was it more or less than falconry school?
howard_wolowitz For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.
leonard_hofstadter Like I would swing with him.
raj_koothrappali How you feeling?
sheldon_cooper Good. Little claustrophobic.
raj_koothrappali Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.
sheldon_cooper Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
raj_koothrappali Do you know any mining songs?
sheldon_cooper Just the hits. Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew.
raj_koothrappali That’s pretty.
sheldon_cooper Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
raj_koothrappali It’s a little more bleak than I thought.
sheldon_cooper Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.
raj_koothrappali Getting kind of grim.
sheldon_cooper Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.
raj_koothrappali Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
sheldon_cooper Who’s he?
howard_wolowitz Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here.
howard_wolowitz Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.
leonard_hofstadter She made him a chore chart.
penny I see it.
howard_wolowitz Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.
bernadette_rostenkowski That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
howard_wolowitz That pan had to soak and you know it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance.
howard_wolowitz It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.
leonard_hofstadter I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.
raj_koothrappali So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.
sheldon_cooper That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
raj_koothrappali But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
sheldon_cooper He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
amy_farrah_fowler You guys doing okay down there?
sheldon_cooper I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
amy_farrah_fowler You guys doing okay down there?
sheldon_cooper Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
sheldon_cooper This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, just checking.
raj_koothrappali We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
sheldon_cooper You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.
raj_koothrappali What if we brought them down with us?
sheldon_cooper We’ll take some Funyuns.
amy_farrah_fowler Anything else?
sheldon_cooper Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.
raj_koothrappali Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry you guys had to see that.
penny Oh, don’t apologize.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
bernadette_rostenkowski Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.
penny It really bothers him?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him.
penny Uh-oh.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.
leonard_hofstadter Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go check on him.
penny Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
penny It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
howard_wolowitz Why are you being so bossy?
bernadette_rostenkowski Why are you being a baby?
howard_wolowitz I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?
leonard_hofstadter Should we go?
penny Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
raj_koothrappali Oh, this heat is brutal.
sheldon_cooper As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.
raj_koothrappali Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
sheldon_cooper My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
raj_koothrappali How’s that going?
sheldon_cooper You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
sheldon_cooper We’re not stopping.
raj_koothrappali You don’t have to bite my head off.
sheldon_cooper I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle.
raj_koothrappali If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable.
sheldon_cooper My struggle is emotional.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Is it Amy?
sheldon_cooper It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.
sheldon_cooper Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
raj_koothrappali The space probe.
sheldon_cooper Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
raj_koothrappali By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, is everything okay?
sheldon_cooper It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler 11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought.
raj_koothrappali They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt.
penny Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It’s my first time, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.
howard_wolowitz It’s okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.
howard_wolowitz I want that, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski Now, let’s talk about your birthday party.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you really need me to transcribe this?
sheldon_cooper You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.
raj_koothrappali You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.
sheldon_cooper His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
