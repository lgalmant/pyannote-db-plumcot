leonard Who wants the last dumpling?
penny Ooh, me.
sheldon Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.
penny Thank you all for this high honour.
sheldon I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.
howard All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go. This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. Yeah, well, now it means her.
bernadette It’s okay if he wants to come.
howard Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.
penny All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.
sheldon Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?
howard Neither of them are close.
sheldon Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.
penny Okay, I’m not driving him.
sheldon No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.
leonard Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
amy No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.
leonard Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…
amy I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
leonard Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
amy Not really, no.
leonard All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
amy Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.
leonard Amy?
amy Yo.
leonard You okay?
amy Oh, sure.
leonard I thought you were reading.
amy I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.
leonard I, I’m fine.
amy Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
leonard What, who told you that?
amy Well, most recently my gynaecologist.
leonard Well, you stay as long as you’d like.
amy I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.
bernadette What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?
sheldon Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
howard Which side do you come down on?
sheldon I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.
howard Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
bernadette That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
howard First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.
bernadette Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
howard Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.
bernadette Is she moving out?
howard Why would she move out? It’s her house.
bernadette Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?
sheldon Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.
howard Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
bernadette I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
howard Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.
bernadette Raj, take me home.
howard Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
bernadette Take me home now.
howard Movie theatre.
raj Mmmmmm.
sheldon Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do.
amy How was your shower?
leonard It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?
amy Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?
leonard Not really. Is that my yearbook?
amy Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.
leonard Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
amy If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.
leonard Aw.
amy Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.
sheldon Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.
leonard Rough night, Casey Jones?
sheldon You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
leonard What’s in the bag?
sheldon I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that.
amy Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.
leonard Ah, sure. That’d be nice.
amy Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
leonard Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
amy I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.
sheldon Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
amy Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.
sheldon Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
howard I’ll get it!
mrs_wolowitz Could you get it?
howard I said I’m getting it!
mrs_wolowitz Fine, I’ll get it!
howard I got it! Oh, hi.
bernadette Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
howard Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.
mrs_wolowitz I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!
howard The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.
bernadette And your mom would be okay with that?
howard Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?
mrs_wolowitz Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?
howard See? She’s good with it.
mrs_wolowitz Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!
sheldon All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.
penny You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
amy Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?
penny Really? For a wedding?
amy Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
leonard Ready.
penny Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
sheldon Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.
amy I got you this to give to me.
penny Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.
amy I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.
penny Put the corsage on her.
leonard Amy, this is for you.
amy When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
sheldon All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
howard So, dinner went nice.
bernadette Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?
howard Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.
mrs_wolowitz Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!
bernadette I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.
mrs_wolowitz You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!
howard Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?
mrs_wolowitz Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!
bernadette Oh, God.
howard Relax, it’ll be fine.
bernadette Okay.
mrs_wolowitz Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!
amy Would you like to dance?
leonard No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.
amy You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.
leonard I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
amy Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.
leonard That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
amy Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.
leonard Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
amy I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.
leonard I’m not moody. I’m fun.
amy You have any evidence to support that statement?
leonard Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.
amy Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
leonard Okay, fine, what do you suggest?
amy We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.
leonard Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.
amy Don’t worry, I’ll lead.
amy Howard?
howard Ready for bed?
bernadette No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
howard Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!
mrs_wolowitz You don’t know that! I just sat down!
howard Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!
mrs_wolowitz She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!
howard Problem solved.
bernadette No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.
howard Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.
mrs_wolowitz Ha! The eagle has landed!
howard And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.
amy There we go, last floor.
leonard I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
amy The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
leonard I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
amy You’re welcome.
leonard And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
amy I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.
leonard Well, okay. Again, thank you.
amy And again, you’re welcome.
leonard Want to come in, have a cup of tea?
amy No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.
leonard Okay. Well, good night.
amy Good night.
penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
amy Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
penny Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?
amy Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
penny Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?
amy The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
penny Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
amy No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart.
penny Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.
amy Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.
penny So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?
amy No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does.
sheldon Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.
leonard Sounds like you had a great night.
sheldon I did. How was yours?
leonard Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
sheldon What exactly do you mean by that?
leonard Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. Ow! Why did you do that?
sheldon To send a message. She is not for you.
leonard What?
sheldon Not for you!
bernadette Good morning, handsome.
howard Morning, Mom.
bernadette It’s me.
howard Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.
bernadette Your mom and I made you breakfast.
howard Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?
bernadette Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.
mrs_wolowitz Does he like the pancakes?!
bernadette He didn’t try them yet!
howard Is there any butter?
bernadette It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
howard Oh.
mrs_wolowitz So, what’s the word?
bernadette He wants butter!
mrs_wolowitz It’s butter-flavoured syrup
bernadette I just told him that!
howard I don’t need any butter.
bernadette If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.
howard Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself.
