leonard_hofstadter So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
mary_cooper It’s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you’d come with me, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.
mary_cooper You’re missing out. It’s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It’s all themed. There’s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.
leonard_hofstadter What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
mary_cooper Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire ’em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord’s forgiveness.
sheldon_cooper Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.
mary_cooper For example, if Shelly was aboard, he’d write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!
sheldon_cooper The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.
mary_cooper Sounds delicious.
sheldon_cooper Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook.
sheldon_cooper Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
mary_cooper Actually, I wouldn’t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
leonard_hofstadter All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street.
mary_cooper I’ve never had it, but there’s no harm in trying something new.
sheldon_cooper There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person.
mary_cooper Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he’s fine.
sheldon_cooper Told you.
mary_cooper Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.
all@ Irasshaimase!
sheldon_cooper Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
sheldon_cooper The prospect of fried chicken.
mary_cooper This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben’s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don’t make it sushi.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.
mary_cooper Oh, I thought the one we couldn’t say was ching chong.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah, that, too.
mary_cooper So, Shelly, what’s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit?
sheldon_cooper Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.
mary_cooper Do you have any idea what’s going on with those two?
leonard_hofstadter It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.
mary_cooper How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you’re in some sort of a long distance situation?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.
mary_cooper Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits.
sheldon_cooper And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it.
mary_cooper Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.
leonard_hofstadter Please pester her. Please, for me.
leonard_hofstadter So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?
mary_cooper It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
leonard_hofstadter Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
sheldon_cooper Get them before they get us.
raj_koothrappali Hey, look who decided to show up.
leonard_hofstadter Raj, what are you doing?
raj_koothrappali I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.
sheldon_cooper Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.
raj_koothrappali Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
mary_cooper Well, it’s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.
leonard_hofstadter We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list.
mary_cooper Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?
raj_koothrappali Nothing, I’m fine.
mary_cooper Are ya?
raj_koothrappali No.
mary_cooper That’s better. Now tell me what’s bothering you.
raj_koothrappali I’m so lonely.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.
mary_cooper Sheldon, your friend is hurtin’. What do we do when someone’s hurtin’?
sheldon_cooper Offer them a hot beverage.
mary_cooper And when they’re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?
sheldon_cooper Coffee.
mary_cooper And what do we do it with? Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can’t find someone, but there’s a lock for every key. Back home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she’d never find a man, then one day, wouldn’t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.
raj_koothrappali I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
sheldon_cooper I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?
leonard_hofstadter You want some Oreos?
sheldon_cooper Double Stuf?
leonard_hofstadter No, regular.
sheldon_cooper Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
sheldon_cooper I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.
mary_cooper Sure. One thing you really miss when you’re on vacation is laundry.
sheldon_cooper Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
mary_cooper Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.
sheldon_cooper It is nice, isn’t it?
penny Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
mary_cooper Oh, hello, darlin’.
penny Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.
sheldon_cooper It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.
mary_cooper So, how’ve you been?
penny Good, good.
mary_cooper I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?
penny Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there.
mary_cooper Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this?
penny Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
sheldon_cooper Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.
mary_cooper Hon, you think maybe the reason why you’re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?
penny Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?
mary_cooper Oh, not crazy at all. And don’t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.
sheldon_cooper Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
howard_wolowitz So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.
mary_cooper Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I’ve got a good book you could read.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.
mary_cooper I bet your mom is really proud of you.
howard_wolowitz Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still.
sheldon_cooper I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.
mary_cooper I don’t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.
sheldon_cooper What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
mary_cooper Come on, Sheldon, we’ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.
penny Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.
mary_cooper Well, I can’t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.
howard_wolowitz What do you say?
sheldon_cooper What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.
howard_wolowitz He’s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
leonard_hofstadter These are delicious.
mary_cooper The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.
leonard_hofstadter Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
mary_cooper Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we’re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.
sheldon_cooper Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.
mary_cooper Apology accepted.
sheldon_cooper Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.
mary_cooper I am still going out with your friends.
sheldon_cooper But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
mary_cooper Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don’t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.
sheldon_cooper I’m not going, and you can’t make me.
mary_cooper You’re right, I can’t. Have a nice day.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind.
mary_cooper Well, then you are going to stand there all day.
leonard_hofstadter I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
mary_cooper I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.
sheldon_cooper We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.
mary_cooper Well, I guess we are.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. Syrup.
sheldon_cooper All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true.
leonard_hofstadter I hadn’t…
sheldon_cooper That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you getting sick?
sheldon_cooper No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?
sheldon_cooper No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
sheldon_cooper Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else.
sheldon_cooper Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?
mary_cooper Oh, this one’s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.
leonard_hofstadter Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.
mary_cooper My goodness, it’s a wonder you people in California can talk at all.
penny This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
penny Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?
raj_koothrappali Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.
howard_wolowitz Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.
mary_cooper Hey, while we’re here, why don’t we all do some praying? Let’s put a little church in this church.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m not sure we should.
mary_cooper It’s easy. I’ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.
penny Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.
mary_cooper She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you’re up. Wasserman, you’re on deck.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great.
mary_cooper Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?
howard_wolowitz Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames.
mary_cooper Rajesh?
howard_wolowitz He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
mary_cooper Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.
howard_wolowitz No, you only get one wish.
sheldon_cooper Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. Smarty-pants.
penny Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.
mary_cooper You take notes, darlin’. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He’ll die at 50 but his love will be true.
sheldon_cooper I need a tissue.This one got wet.
leonard_hofstadter Here.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same.
mary_cooper Sweetheart, are you sick?
sheldon_cooper I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living.
mary_cooper Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We’ve got to get you to bed.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
mary_cooper Don’t worry. Mama’s here to take care of her baby.
sheldon_cooper And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.
mary_cooper Of course.
sheldon_cooper Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
mary_cooper You can have whatever you want.
sheldon_cooper Thanks, Mom.You’re the best.
mary_cooper Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn’t have hair on your chest.
sheldon_cooper I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.
mary_cooper And whose fault was that?
sheldon_cooper Yours.
mary_cooper Shelly, you’re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.
sheldon_cooper No, we don’t. The one we have works great.
mary_cooper Sweetheart, you are a grown man.
sheldon_cooper Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler.
mary_cooper Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.
sheldon_cooper Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
mary_cooper No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
leonard_hofstadter Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie.
