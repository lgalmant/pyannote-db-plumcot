bernadette_rostenkowski Almost there. You’re doing great.
howard_wolowitz Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.
raj_koothrappali Please hurry.
debbie_wolowitz I don’t need a treadmill.
howard_wolowitz The doctor says you need to get exercise.
debbie_wolowitz I get plenty of exercise.
howard_wolowitz Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.
raj_koothrappali If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
howard_wolowitz She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
raj_koothrappali All right. Now what?
bernadette_rostenkowski We set it up in Howie’s old room.
raj_koothrappali Do you know how to set it up?
howard_wolowitz Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.
debbie_wolowitz Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.
raj_koothrappali So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
leonard_hofstadter Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
amy_farrah_fowler Should we do something for her?
sheldon_cooper I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.
sheldon_cooper I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how were things on the set?
penny Uh, pretty good, actually.
raj_koothrappali So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
penny Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.
amy_farrah_fowler Good for you.
penny Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.
sheldon_cooper Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
leonard_hofstadter It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I know.
howard_wolowitz Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
howard_wolowitz You mean a forklift?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?
howard_wolowitz Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?
bernadette_rostenkowski I would do it for my mother.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?
howard_wolowitz We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.
howard_wolowitz Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
debbie_wolowitz I need to tinkle.
howard_wolowitz Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
bernadette_rostenkowski You are a putz.
howard_wolowitz As advertised.
sheldon_cooper Thanks for coming with me.
raj_koothrappali Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?
sheldon_cooper I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
raj_koothrappali Is that a real thing?
sheldon_cooper Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.
raj_koothrappali Emily, Hey.
emily_sweeney Oh, hey, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
emily_sweeney Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.
raj_koothrappali Are you here alone?
emily_sweeney No, not really.
raj_koothrappali What do you mean, not really?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Hey, should we get our seats?
emily_sweeney Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, okay.
sheldon_cooper That was awkward, right?
raj_koothrappali Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
sheldon_cooper Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 And action.
wil_wheaton Please don’t shut me out.
penny Go away. Just go away.
wil_wheaton I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.
penny What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
wil_wheaton I was trying to save your life.
penny Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.
wil_wheaton You can’t give up. I love you.
penny I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.
penny Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Let’s just move on. No one cares.
penny Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.
leonard_hofstadter Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 And who are you?
leonard_hofstadter I’m her boyfriend.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Isn’t she too hot for you?
leonard_hofstadter A little, yeah.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Well, boyfriend, get off my set.
penny You can’t do that. He’s with me.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.
penny What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.
wil_wheaton Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.
wil_wheaton Wow, that fell apart really fast.
raj_koothrappali Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
raj_koothrappali You don’t have to make me anything.
sheldon_cooper No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
raj_koothrappali Sorry, I left them in my turban.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
raj_koothrappali Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
sheldon_cooper Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
raj_koothrappali But you don’t have sex with her, either.
sheldon_cooper Slick, huh?
raj_koothrappali To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
sheldon_cooper Have you had intercourse?
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
debbie_wolowitz I’m hungry again.
howard_wolowitz It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.
howard_wolowitz No, it’s not.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.
howard_wolowitz Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.
debbie_wolowitz I’m still hungry.
howard_wolowitz I’m coming, you big baby.
penny You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.
wil_wheaton Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.
penny Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.
wil_wheaton Hey. I just lost a job for you.
penny All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.
wil_wheaton Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.
penny God, what am I doing with my life?
leonard_hofstadter You having second thoughts about acting?
penny You were on set, you saw what it was like.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.
penny Oh, really?
leonard_hofstadter What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?
penny It was over a bowling alley.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but there was ample parking.
penny Are you done?
leonard_hofstadter And you were so good in the TV commercial.
penny It was for haemorrhoid cream.
leonard_hofstadter And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
penny Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.
leonard_hofstadter Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
penny Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.
raj_koothrappali I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?
sheldon_cooper An interesting question. Well, good night.
raj_koothrappali What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.
sheldon_cooper That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
raj_koothrappali What do you mean?
sheldon_cooper How many women have you had dates with?
raj_koothrappali Eleven.
sheldon_cooper How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
raj_koothrappali Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
sheldon_cooper Sure.
raj_koothrappali I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
sheldon_cooper Well, now do you see the problem?
raj_koothrappali Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.
sheldon_cooper I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, I’m back!
howard_wolowitz Shh, I just got her to sleep.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry.
howard_wolowitz What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.
bernadette_rostenkowski They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
howard_wolowitz Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
bernadette_rostenkowski So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.
howard_wolowitz A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.
bernadette_rostenkowski Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.
howard_wolowitz Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.
debbie_wolowitz Howard.
howard_wolowitz Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
emily_sweeney Thanks for letting me come over.
raj_koothrappali Of course. Please, come in.
emily_sweeney I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.
raj_koothrappali Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.
emily_sweeney I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.
raj_koothrappali It’s okay.
emily_sweeney Really?
raj_koothrappali Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.
emily_sweeney Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.
emily_sweeney Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.
raj_koothrappali Well, me, neither.
emily_sweeney Okay.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?
emily_sweeney Yeah.
raj_koothrappali I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
emily_sweeney That’s cool.
raj_koothrappali It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?
emily_sweeney One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.
raj_koothrappali It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.
emily_sweeney Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?
raj_koothrappali But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.
penny Oh, my God. What a day.
leonard_hofstadter Can I get you anything?
penny No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
leonard_hofstadter With your career?
penny With my life.
leonard_hofstadter Like what?
penny I don’t know. We could get married.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, be serious.
penny I am.
leonard_hofstadter Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?
penny Well, yeah.
leonard_hofstadter So I’m like a bran muffin.
penny What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.
penny What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.
penny Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.
leonard_hofstadter No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.
penny You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.
leonard_hofstadter You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.
penny Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.
leonard_hofstadter Then what do you need?
penny You, you stupid Pop-Tart.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Then I guess I’m in.
penny Really? You guess you’re in?
leonard_hofstadter Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!
leonard_hofstadter So is that it? Are, are we engaged?
penny Yeah, I think so.
leonard_hofstadter All right.
penny What’s wrong?
leonard_hofstadter I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
penny Yeah, it kind of does, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I know. This might help.
penny Where did you get a ring?
leonard_hofstadter I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?
penny Oh, my God, yes.
leonard_hofstadter This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
howard_wolowitz How you feeling?
bernadette_rostenkowski Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.
howard_wolowitz I’m proud of us.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too.
debbie_wolowitz Where’s my pancakes?!
foreign_nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!
bernadette_rostenkowski You were right.
howard_wolowitz Welcome to Team Putz.
