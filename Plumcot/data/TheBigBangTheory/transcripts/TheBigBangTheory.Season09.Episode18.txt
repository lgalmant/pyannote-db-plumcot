howard_wolowitz Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?
sheldon_cooper I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
howard_wolowitz Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn.
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 Come on in, fellas.
howard_wolowitz See, he’s not wearing a tie.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 So, I’ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.
sheldon_cooper That’s great.
howard_wolowitz Excellent.
leonard_hofstadter So what happens next?
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I don’t think there will be.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we did our own search.
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 That’s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.
sheldon_cooper Get a load of this guy.
howard_wolowitz Can you imagine if we make money with this?
leonard_hofstadter If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.
howard_wolowitz That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.
howard_wolowitz Seventy-five percent?
sheldon_cooper That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 It’s university policy.
sheldon_cooper I know when I’m beat.
leonard_hofstadter Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?
leonard_hofstadter Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I’m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you’re not entitled to an ownership share.
howard_wolowitz Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?
attorney#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s not fair. We should all get plaques.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, but we can’t sign this.
howard_wolowitz Come on, let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you for your time.
sheldon_cooper Couple of questions about the plaque.
amy_farrah_fowler So, have you been having any morning sickness?
bernadette_rostenkowski A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell.
penny Is that a pregnancy thing?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.
penny But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do.
penny Oh, sure. Let me see it.
amy_farrah_fowler See what?
raj_koothrappali I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.
penny Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s nice.
penny Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?
raj_koothrappali I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?
amy_farrah_fowler Why wouldn’t you open it?
raj_koothrappali Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.
bernadette_rostenkowski You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?
penny I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
amy_farrah_fowler She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound.
bernadette_rostenkowski Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal.
penny Come on, just open it.
raj_koothrappali You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.
penny Well, never hurts to have a spare.
bernadette_rostenkowski What is that?
raj_koothrappali Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
amy_farrah_fowler What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
raj_koothrappali I know, she’s so thoughtful.
penny See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.
raj_koothrappali You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.
amy_farrah_fowler You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?
howard_wolowitz We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.
sheldon_cooper Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.
leonard_hofstadter Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all.
howard_wolowitz Either way, I get nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.
sheldon_cooper To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.
howard_wolowitz I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
leonard_hofstadter Of course, we can split any profits three ways.
sheldon_cooper I’m fine with that.
howard_wolowitz Okay, great.
sheldon_cooper It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, we could write something up.
sheldon_cooper But which one of us should be the party who…
howard_wolowitz You can do it, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper So stipulated.
leonard_hofstadter Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.
bernadette_rostenkowski I wonder how much she spent on this.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, let’s find out.
raj_koothrappali It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.
penny Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?
raj_koothrappali Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me.
amy_farrah_fowler These things go for five hundred dollars and up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.
penny Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?
raj_koothrappali Maybe you’re right.
bernadette_rostenkowski Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.
raj_koothrappali Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?
penny Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.
raj_koothrappali Hello?
emily_sweeney Hey, it’s Emily. Is this a good time?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?
emily_sweeney Was it okay I left that gift? I’m really hoping we can be friends.
raj_koothrappali Maybe, maybe.
emily_sweeney Um, you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.
emily_sweeney I just, I miss hanging out with you. It’s not like I lost a friend, it’s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you’d want to come over?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea.
emily_sweeney Okay. I’m just, I’m having a really hard time, but that’s not your problem, that’s mine. I, I won’t bother you again, but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You’re a good guy.
raj_koothrappali Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.
penny I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you.
raj_koothrappali Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?
raj_koothrappali No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
penny Say hi to Emily for us.
raj_koothrappali Will do.
howard_wolowitz This contract looks good to me.
sheldon_cooper I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.
leonard_hofstadter I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.
bernadette_rostenkowski What is it?
howard_wolowitz Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.
penny Sheldon, did you draft the contract?
sheldon_cooper You bet I did.
penny Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know, but…
howard_wolowitz Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now.
penny What?
howard_wolowitz Honey, this is fine.
bernadette_rostenkowski If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.
howard_wolowitz Can I talk to you in the hall?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
howard_wolowitz Excuse us.
sheldon_cooper Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd.
leonard_hofstadter Good one.
sheldon_cooper Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
bernadette_rostenkowski I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.
howard_wolowitz What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.
howard_wolowitz All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
howard_wolowitz Here we go with the ironclad logic again.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
howard_wolowitz Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating.
raj_koothrappali Hello?
claire Hey, Raj. It’s Claire. How are you?
raj_koothrappali Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.
claire Really?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?
claire Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out.
raj_koothrappali Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.
claire So if you were still interested.
raj_koothrappali Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?
claire Uh, I’m almost off work. What are you doing now?
raj_koothrappali Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.
claire Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more?
raj_koothrappali That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?
claire I’m a girl. It’s, like, page one out of the playbook.
raj_koothrappali Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
leonard_hofstadter They’ve been out there a while.
amy_farrah_fowler I hope everything’s okay.
sheldon_cooper I wonder what they’re talking about.
penny If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter You guys all right?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.
sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me.
sheldon_cooper Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?
sheldon_cooper No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.
howard_wolowitz See? This is what happens every time we work together.
penny You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?
leonard_hofstadter What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?
penny No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.
bernadette_rostenkowski How would you enforce it?
sheldon_cooper Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.
amy_farrah_fowler And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, what do you think?
howard_wolowitz I’m on board.
sheldon_cooper I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time.
emily_sweeney Hello?
raj_koothrappali Hey, Emily, listen, I’ve been thinking, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over.
emily_sweeney Oh. Okay. I understand.
raj_koothrappali No, no. Please don’t cry.
emily_sweeney Okay, I’ll stop.
claire Hello?
raj_koothrappali Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…
claire Fine. Do what you want, but she’s playing you.
raj_koothrappali I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.
claire You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I’m having such a rough day.
raj_koothrappali Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by.
emily_sweeney Why not?
raj_koothrappali I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…
emily_sweeney I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?
raj_koothrappali Call you right back.
sheldon_cooper The, the revisions I made start on page four.
penny Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
amy_farrah_fowler You should see the Valentine’s Day card he gave me.
howard_wolowitz Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.
sheldon_cooper Do you still like cilantro?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper You’re tying my hands here.
howard_wolowitz All right, let’s sign this.
penny Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what did you do?
howard_wolowitz I should’ve known.
bernadette_rostenkowski 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that’s so nice.
leonard_hofstadter That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
howard_wolowitz That’s very generous, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions.
howard_wolowitz I appreciate that.
sheldon_cooper And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What? I didn’t sign it yet.
raj_koothrappali I hear what you’re saying, but I’ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.
claire All right, it’s your life. But you know how this is gonna end.
raj_koothrappali As a matter of fact, I do. I’m gonna comfort her, because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.
raj_koothrappali Good talk.
