amy Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?
raj He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.
penny I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
leonard Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.
raj Have you heard from Howard?
bernadette I did. His talk at NASA went great.
penny Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
bernadette No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.
stuart Hey, guys.
amy Oh, hi.
bernadette Hi, Stuart.
raj Hey, Stuart!
stuart How’s it going?
raj Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.
stuart Oh, how is it?
penny Disgusting. Do not tell him.
leonard What do you guys want to do tonight?
amy I don’t know.
bernadette Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.
raj Stuart? Are you okay?
stuart No, I don’t feel so…
leonard Oh, my God, Stuart?
penny Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
raj Stuart?
leonard Calling 911.
raj Well, it’s too late.
leonard What do you mean it’s too late?
raj He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard Oh, come on.
raj Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
amy I’m leaving.
raj You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
bernadette I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.
amy Yeah, it’s Bloom.
penny Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
stuart What do you think I was gonna do at home?
penny Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
raj Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?
penny You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.
raj Thank you.
penny That kind of actress. This sucks.
leonard Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.
amy I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
raj Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.
amy Oh, ugh.
bernadette All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?
raj Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
bernadette What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
raj Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
amy According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.
raj Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
penny Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?
raj Any question but that.
penny Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?
stuart Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
bernadette What do you care? You’re dead.
stuart Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.
sheldon Thank you for my bobble head.
howard Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
sheldon It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?
howard We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.
sheldon I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
howard Oh, boy.
sheldon Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
howard I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
bernadette So, what happens next?
raj I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
penny Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
amy Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.
leonard Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
raj Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.
penny Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
raj Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.
bernadette I didn’t know you were fat.
raj Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.
amy That is so sweet.
leonard I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
raj No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
bernadette Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
amy What’s it for?
bernadette For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.
raj From the future? How fun and imaginative.
leonard So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
raj Correct.
leonard Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?
raj Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
leonard Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
penny I’m gonna need another clue.
howard Okay, give me the flowers and pie.
sheldon But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.
howard They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
sheldon Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.
howard What’s wrong?
sheldon Nothing.
howard What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.
sheldon I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
howard You ready to talk about it?
sheldon I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
howard Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?
sheldon No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
howard Well, did she see you in the window?
sheldon No.
howard Then don’t say anything.
sheldon I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?
howard Well, don’t do it on the phone.
sheldon No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.
howard That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
sheldon Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.
howard Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.
sheldon I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.
raj Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.
penny Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.
stuart Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
raj Fine, just try not to look too alive.
stuart That’s my jam.
bernadette So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
amy But why?
raj Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
amy Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.
penny Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.
leonard Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.
penny Hmm.
bernadette So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
raj Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
amy What does your card say, Bernadette?
leonard Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?
penny Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.
leonard But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
penny Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.
leonard Well, you don’t go into science for the money.
bernadette Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
penny So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?
amy Dun, dun, dun. He started it.
raj Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
leonard Great.
penny Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
sheldon Okay, let’s do this.
howard Good luck.
sheldon You, aren’t you gonna come with me?
howard While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
sheldon Mother? Mother? Mother?
mrs_cooper Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.
sheldon I saw you having naked sex.
mrs_cooper What are you talking about?
sheldon Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
mrs_cooper Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
sheldon Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
mrs_cooper That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
sheldon Who was he?
mrs_cooper His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
sheldon How long have you been involved with him?
mrs_cooper A few months.
sheldon And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
mrs_cooper That is no way to speak to your mother.
sheldon Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.
mrs_cooper I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
sheldon Or what?
mrs_cooper Or I will send you to your room.
sheldon That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
mrs_cooper Go to your room.
sheldon But I occupy the moral high ground.
mrs_cooper Go to your room.
sheldon But I’m a professional scientist.
mrs Go to your room!
sheldon I’m a grown man.
raj Can we please get back to the game?
leonard In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
penny Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.
amy I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
leonard Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
amy Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.
penny In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?
stuart I think you and Leonard will be together.
penny You do?
stuart Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.
leonard Aw.
penny That’s so sweet.
bernadette What the hell?
amy Excuse me?
penny Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?
stuart Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.
penny Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
raj Oh, come on.
bernadette Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.
howard Hey, can I come in?
sheldon Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
howard That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.
sheldon No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
howard You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.
sheldon Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
howard I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
sheldon I didn’t know she did.
howard Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.
sheldon What did you do?
howard Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
sheldon I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.
howard All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
sheldon You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
howard And the healing begins.
sheldon Hello.
mrs_cooper Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
sheldon I am.
mrs_cooper Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
sheldon I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?
mrs_cooper You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.
sheldon Then why are you doing it?
mrs_cooper Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.
sheldon Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.
mrs_cooper That is very Christian of you.
sheldon Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.
mrs_cooper How old do you think I am?
sheldon My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.
mrs_cooper Are you having the sex talk with me?
sheldon Well, someone has to.
mrs_cooper Oh, dear Lord.
sheldon No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.
penny Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.
raj I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
amy It actually was kind of fun.
raj You’re just saying that.
amy Yeah.
bernadette I liked the time travel element.
raj Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
leonard It was. By Terminator.
bernadette Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.
penny Definitely.
leonard Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.
bernadette Aw.
penny I love it.
leonard Putting it in my phone right now.
penny Yeah, me, too.
stuart My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.
raj And it’s done.
penny Yup, we’re all in.
leonard All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.
stuart I knew it.
