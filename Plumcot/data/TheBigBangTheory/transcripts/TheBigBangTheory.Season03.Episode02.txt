howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
sheldon_cooper Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?
howard_wolowitz Okay, first of all…
raj_koothrappali Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person.
sheldon_cooper I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
leonard_hofstadter There’s more to life than sex, Raj.
howard_wolowitz Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?
sheldon_cooper I did.
leonard_hofstadter Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.
howard_wolowitz You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
howard_wolowitz What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
raj_koothrappali Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
sheldon_cooper Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
leonard_hofstadter Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
raj_koothrappali Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.
howard_wolowitz Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah.
leonard_hofstadter To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…
raj_koothrappali Disappointed? Let down?
howard_wolowitz Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
leonard_hofstadter All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.
howard_wolowitz Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.
raj_koothrappali That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, dinner’s here.
sheldon_cooper Tandoori Palace?
leonard_hofstadter No, we went somewhere new.
sheldon_cooper You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?
leonard_hofstadter No, look, Mumbai Palace.
sheldon_cooper Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
leonard_hofstadter Trust me, this will be just fine.
howard_wolowitz You are the authority on just fine.
leonard_hofstadter What’s that supposed to mean?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.
penny What are they talking about?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know
sheldon_cooper I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
leonard_hofstadter Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
sheldon_cooper If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
penny Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
sheldon_cooper I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you…
howard_wolowitz Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out.
penny Ugh, I am so embarrassed!
leonard_hofstadter Please don’t be mad.
penny What did you tell them?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.
penny Fine? You said it was fine?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
penny It was… okay.
leonard_hofstadter Okay?
penny Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.
leonard_hofstadter So, you’ve been through this before?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter Okay-dokay.
penny You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?
leonard_hofstadter So much.
penny Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
penny Don’t talk, just drink.
howard_wolowitz No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them.
raj_koothrappali Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t.
sheldon_cooper Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. Oh, good! Now I can eat.
raj_koothrappali What’s that?
howard_wolowitz Sounds like a cricket.
sheldon_cooper Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.
howard_wolowitz Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?
sheldon_cooper In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
raj_koothrappali How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
sheldon_cooper Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.
howard_wolowitz Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket.
sheldon_cooper Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
howard_wolowitz No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.
raj_koothrappali Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
sheldon_cooper That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
howard_wolowitz Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket.
sheldon_cooper I can’t take your money.
howard_wolowitz What’s the matter, you chicken?
sheldon_cooper I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
raj_koothrappali Chickens can’t climb trees
sheldon_cooper Thank God.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me.
sheldon_cooper Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
howard_wolowitz I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.
sheldon_cooper All right, you have a wager.
howard_wolowitz Hmm.
raj_koothrappali Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
raj_koothrappali I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
leonard_hofstadter More wine?
penny Hit me.
sheldon_cooper I don’t see anything.
howard_wolowitz Shh!
raj_koothrappali Hallway.
sheldon_cooper One at a time. What was that?
raj_koothrappali My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?
howard_wolowitz Shh! Elevator shaft.
sheldon_cooper Help me open it.
howard_wolowitz Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
sheldon_cooper Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
howard_wolowitz Let’s open her up.
sheldon_cooper Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
howard_wolowitz Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
raj_koothrappali Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
leonard_hofstadter What are we drinking now?
penny Peppermint schnapps.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
penny Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Schnapps.
leonard_hofstadter Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.
raj_koothrappali Be careful.
sheldon_cooper If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
raj_koothrappali Stairwell.
sheldon_cooper Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.
penny Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?
leonard_hofstadter I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. Are you okay?
raj_koothrappali Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
sheldon_cooper His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
raj_koothrappali What would you name him?
sheldon_cooper An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.
howard_wolowitz All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.
sheldon_cooper Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
howard_wolowitz That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?
raj_koothrappali Oh, I really don’t care anymore
leonard_hofstadter God, I had the most horrible night.
raj_koothrappali What happened?
sheldon_cooper Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
howard_wolowitz Shiksa. Shik-sa.
sheldon_cooper Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again.
sheldon_cooper We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
howard_wolowitz All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor
sheldon_cooper He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.
leonard_hofstadter I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
raj_koothrappali Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here. Don’t do that!
howard_wolowitz You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
professor_crawley Don’t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
professor_crawley Who wants to know?
sheldon_cooper I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
professor_crawley Couldn’t wait, huh?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry?
professor_crawley I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.
howard_wolowitz No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question.
professor_crawley Let me ask you one first. What’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
raj_koothrappali Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
professor_crawley What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
raj_koothrappali I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
sheldon_cooper No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
professor_crawley Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we’re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We’re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
howard_wolowitz Well, could you look at Toby?
professor_crawley Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
sheldon_cooper Told you.
professor_crawley It’s a field cricket.
howard_wolowitz Yes!
sheldon_cooper No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
professor_crawley Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.
sheldon_cooper Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
professor_crawley Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!
sheldon_cooper Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
raj_koothrappali Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
penny Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?
sheldon_cooper Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
penny What do you have a safe deposit box for?
sheldon_cooper Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
penny What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular.
sheldon_cooper Penny, I’d rather not talk about it.
penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either.
sheldon_cooper Why would that make me feel better?
penny I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.
penny What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?
sheldon_cooper A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
penny Okay, forget the chicken.
sheldon_cooper Well, I wish I could.
penny No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
penny No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
sheldon_cooper I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Interesting.
sheldon_cooper Hardly.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me.
sheldon_cooper Have I crossed some sort of line again?
leonard_hofstadter Little bit.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Oh, who cares?
penny Oh, hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?
penny Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
leonard_hofstadter Is that what you want?
penny I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
leonard_hofstadter I guess.
penny It would take the pressure off.
leonard_hofstadter It would, wouldn’t it?
penny So, we’ll just be friends.
leonard_hofstadter Good, good.
penny Come here.
leonard_hofstadter Okay-dokay
