sheldon Leonard? Leonard?
leonard What?
sheldon You realize you and I could become brothers.
leonard We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
sheldon I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
leonard Go to sleep.
sheldon Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
leonard No.
sheldon Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
penny Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
sheldon Very well.
leonard I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
penny God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
sheldon Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.
penny Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.
leonard Yeah, drive safe.
penny Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
sheldon It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
penny What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.
beverley Penny, wait.
penny Why?
beverley I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
leonard Well, why? What’s wrong?
sheldon Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?
beverley I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.
sheldon Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
beverley Stop it, Sheldon.
sheldon Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?
beverley I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
sheldon Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.
penny Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
sheldon And turned their phones off.
leonard Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
penny Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.
beverley Well, we can’t have that.
sheldon You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
raj It is funny when you think about it.
howard Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
bernadette Because you were driving like a lunatic.
howard Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.
raj Oh, I’ll get it.
bernadette It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
howard I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
raj Hello.
air_force_officer I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz.
raj Howard Wolowitz?
air_force_officer I have the right address, don’t I?
raj Address?
air_force_officer Is he here?
raj Um, no.
air_force_officer Do you know where I can find him?
raj May I ask what this is about?
air_force_officer No, you may not.
raj Very well.
air_force_officer Have him call me.
raj Okay.
howard Raj, who’s at the door?
raj That’s not him.
penny Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
susan Like what? Do they know about your brother?
penny Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
susan Why would you do that?
penny What?
susan The world doesn’t need to know our problems.
penny Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…
wyatt Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.
susan You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?
wyatt Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.
susan Well, quit it.
penny So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
randall Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state.
susan All right, that’s enough jail talk.
randall Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.
susan You sent your brother cigarettes?
wyatt He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.
susan Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.
wyatt Anyway, we’re here, slugger.
howard That’s great, now they know where I live.
raj What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
bernadette Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.
raj Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
howard Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
bernadette Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
howard All right, all right.
raj Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
howard Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.
raj Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.
howard Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?
raj That’s what he said to me.
leonard Here you are, Mother.
beverley Thank you.
leonard I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
beverley I can’t wait for this day to be over.
leonard Yeah, special, like that. That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.
sheldon All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
leonard Hey, guys, come on in.
alfred Oh, thank you.
mary Good morning.
beverley Morning.
sheldon Hello.
alfred How is everyone today?
beverley Good, and you?
alfred Good, good.
beverley Good.
mary I’m good, too.
beverley Good.
sheldon So, did you defile my mother or not?
mary Sheldon. You’re being rude.
alfred If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.
sheldon Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
mary That’s enough.
alfred Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.
leonard You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
sheldon Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
penny All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
randall You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard.
wyatt Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.
susan Not funny, Wyatt.
penny I thought it was really funny.
wyatt Thanks.
susan Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment.
randall That’s not much of a joke.
penny Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
susan Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.
randall Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?
mary How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?
sheldon A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
leonard Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
alfred Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.
mary Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.
alfred Maybe we meet halfway.
sheldon What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
beverley You’re not seriously going to visit each other.
alfred And why wouldn’t we?
beverley Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me.
alfred Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus.
leonard Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.
mary No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.
sheldon What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
leonard Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
sheldon Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?
leonard This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
sheldon But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
leonard Fine, then you go.
mary Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go.
alfred I’ll go with you.
leonard That still leaves me here with him.
amy Who’s ready for a wedding?
sheldon Great, now I have to start all over.
wyatt So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
penny Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
susan See what happens when you work hard?
randall Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em.
susan Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.
wyatt I’ll drink to that.
susan Haven’t you had enough?
wyatt Penny drinks more than I do.
penny Well, I learned from the best.
wyatt Aw.
penny Aw.
susan Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.
randall You see what I’ve gotta put up with.
susan What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
randall It’s called getting caught, Mother.
leonard Hello.
wyatt Hey, there he is.
penny Hey.
susan Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again.
leonard Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
beverley Hello.
susan Hi.
randall We are not white trash.
amy Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
alfred Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused.
mary Oh, so am I.
sheldon You made God sad today, Mom.
amy Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.
sheldon Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.
amy It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
alfred You’re a patient young lady.
sheldon Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.
howard Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
raj Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
howard That’s really stupid advice.
raj You know that hurts my feelings.
howard Calm down, try not to think about it.
raj Okay.
howard Why do I bother talking to you?
raj Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
howard I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?
raj Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.
howard What’s the point of that story?
raj I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
beverley So, what do you do for a living?
randall Mommy, you want to take this one?
susan Um, Randall’s in between jobs.
randall And court appearances.
wyatt It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.
beverley Prepare to be disappointed.
leonard And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?
wyatt Well, I could use another beer.
susan You’re done. He’s done.
penny Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
randall Not at all.
stuart Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart.
beverley Nice to see you, too.
stuart Hi, I’m Stuart.
alfred Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father.
stuart Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?
together No.
stuart I was wondering why the front row was available.
bernadette Okay, I think we’re ready.
sheldon Why do people cry at weddings?
mary They’re practicing for what’s coming later.
susan Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.
randall Thank you for my new teeth.
wyatt Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money.
bernadette We’re here today to celebrate love.
beverley Urgh.
alfred Sigh louder, no one heard you.
stuart Really, I can move.
bernadette Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
sheldon Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
bernadette Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.
howard At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
bernadette Howard.
penny Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
leonard Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t
penny Oh.
bernadette Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
alfred I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other.
beverley I couldn’t agree more.
stuart That’s beautiful.
bernadette Thank you. All right, let’s continue.
sheldon Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.
amy It’s happening.
sheldon Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.
penny Oh.
leonard Thank you.
bernadette Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
beverley Thank you for taking us to the airport.
leonard Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.
alfred Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you.
beverley Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?
alfred Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that.
leonard That’s okay. I can make it over.
beverley No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable.
alfred What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
beverley Do the world a favour, and don’t wake up tomorrow morning.
leonard That was almost a minute.
mary There’s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?
amy You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
mary Good. Thank you.
sheldon Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
mary Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
sheldon Yes ma’am.
amy Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.
sheldon Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.
amy I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
sheldon What, you’re not my mother.
mary Don’t you be disrespectful to her.
sheldon Yes ma’am.
mary You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it.
susan Penny, I don’t know what I was worried about. You’re friends are just lovely.
penny Oh, thanks, Mom.
susan Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.
penny Is he? I never noticed.
wyatt He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.
randall Cops, cops, be cool.
