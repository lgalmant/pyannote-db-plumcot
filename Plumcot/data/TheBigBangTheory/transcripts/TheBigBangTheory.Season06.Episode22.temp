leonard The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.
penny Got it.
sheldon Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
leonard Nice shot.
penny Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
sheldon Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
leonard You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
sheldon Yes.
penny Who’s Professor Proton?
leonard He was the host of this great… Hey!
penny Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
sheldon Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
leonard It was pretty cool.
penny Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
sheldon Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
leonard Hire him to do what?
sheldon Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
leonard It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?
sheldon Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.
leonard Do you remember his old theme song?
sheldon Of course I do.
together Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.
raj Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
howard Why don’t you put her in a kennel?
raj Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
howard To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.
raj Thank you.
sheldon It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
leonard You’re kidding.
howard You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
sheldon And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
howard How’d you get him to come to your house?
sheldon As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
leonard And he wrote him a cheque.
sheldon Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
raj Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
howard You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?
raj And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
howard Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
raj It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.
howard Classy dog.
raj Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.
howatd I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too.
sheldon Leonard, are you in bed?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Me, too.
leonard Great.
sheldon I can’t sleep.
leonard Well, I can, so shut up.
sheldon Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
leonard Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
sheldon I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
leonard That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
sheldon Do you have cufflinks?
leonard No.
sheldon Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?
leonard Okay, good night.
sheldon Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
leonard What?
sheldon I still can’t sleep.
howard She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?
bernadette Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
howard It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
bernadette And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
howard Yeah, that’s what I was doing.
bernadette You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
howard Really?
bernadette Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
howard Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.
bernadette Where’d she go?
howard I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.
bernadette Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.
howard No, I wasn’t. You were.
bernadette No, I wasn’t.
howard Yes, you were!.
bernadette Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.
sheldon I’m getting worried.
penny Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.
sheldon Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
leonard Where is he?
sheldon The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
leonard Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.
arthur I agree.
sheldon Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.
arthur Just, just call me Arthur.
sheldon Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
arthur No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.
sheldon Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
arthur Is, uh, is he dangerous?
leonard Actually, he’s a genius.
sheldon I am.
arthur That doesn’t answer my question.
leonard Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
arthur Hi.
penny Hello.
arthur Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.
sheldon Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.
arthur Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?
leonard Yes, sir.
arthur You’re the genius.
penny So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
arthur It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.
leonard We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
arthur Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living.
leonard That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
arthur You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?
sheldon Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
arthur You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.
sheldon Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
arthur No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
sheldon Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
arthur I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?
bernadette Cinnamon!
howard Cinnamon!
bernadette You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.
howard Good thinking. Cinnamon, come to Daddy.
bernadette Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?
howard Nice.
bernadette Thanks.
howard When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.
bernadette It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
howard Cinnamon!
arthur Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?
penny I think I know.
sheldon It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
penny Okay, I didn’t know.
sheldon Yes.
penny See, I’m not a scientist like them.
arthur I, I figured that out.
sheldon Potato clock. Do potato clock.
penny What’s that?
arthur I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.
penny Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?
arthur No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.
sheldon What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
arthur No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.
leonard Then what is it?
arthur I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.
sheldon Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
arthur What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
sheldon Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something.:14:11,446
penny I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
arthur Uh, thanks.
penny But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
arthur What do you two talk about?
sheldon I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
arthur I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
sheldon Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
arthur No, I, I get that.
sheldon But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
leonard I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
sheldon Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
arthur Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.
leonard It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
arthur Uh-oh.
penny Arthur, are you okay?
arthur I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.
leonard I’ll, I’ll call for help.
penny Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
arthur No.
raj Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.
paramedic Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe.
leonard You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
sheldon I’ll do it.
arthur He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?
paramedic No, that’s not a rule. He can go.
sheldon Oh, yeah.
arthur I can’t catch a break today.
penny We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
leonard I’m sorry things turned out this way.
arthur Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs.
sheldon Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.
bernadette Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.
howard Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?
bernadette It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?
howard It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
raj Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
howard What?
raj A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.
howard You have her?
bernadette Oh, thank God she’s okay.
raj Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.
howard I’m really sorry.
bernadette Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?
raj Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
bernadette So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?
raj Well, I, I thought about…
bernadette Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.
raj Sorry. I, I just…
bernadette Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
howard Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
sheldon Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
arthur Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.
sheldon Want me to sing it again?
arthur No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
sheldon There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
arthur No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
sheldon Name it.
arthur Well, I’m, I’m booked to do a children’s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don’t feel up to it.
sheldon Oh, you’re not. You look awful.
arthur Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you’d fill in for me.
sheldon Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
arthur Yeah.
sheldon Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
arthur Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
sheldon But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
arthur Sounds great.
sheldon So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.
arthur What, Whatever.
sheldon Father.
arthur Sure, what the hell.
