leonard_hofstadter All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
sheldon_cooper That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
leonard_hofstadter So what’s going on with you two?
sheldon_cooper Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.
leonard_hofstadter Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.
leonard_hofstadter Got it.
sheldon_cooper I sense judgment on your part.
leonard_hofstadter No, no. Maybe a little.
sheldon_cooper May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
leonard_hofstadter Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
sheldon_cooper I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right. That.
sheldon_cooper Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not jealous.
sheldon_cooper Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
sheldon_cooper You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist.
leonard_hofstadter Probably. What’s your point?
sheldon_cooper No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm, recently? Not much.
sheldon_cooper Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?
leonard_hofstadter Um, shut up.
sheldon_cooper You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.
leonard_hofstadter That sounds lovely.
sheldon_cooper It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre.
sheldon_cooper Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.
sheldon_cooper It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.We never put Meemaw in a home!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!
howard_wolowitz Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.
raj_koothrappali When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.
leonard_hofstadter You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t.
raj_koothrappali You mean, you don’t.
leonard_hofstadter You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
raj_koothrappali Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk, because she can’t hear me.
leonard_hofstadter What?
raj_koothrappali That’s what she said.
leonard_hofstadter Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no!
leonard_hofstadter …who’s a friend.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Well, good for you.
stuart_bloom Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just break up with her?
stuart_bloom No, no, I can’t.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
stuart_bloom ‘Cause then I’d be alone, like you.
raj_koothrappali Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
leonard_hofstadter Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.
leonard_hofstadter You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
raj_koothrappali Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
sheldon_cooper Leonard? Are you sleeping?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Are you ill?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Maybe.
sheldon_cooper I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
amy_farrah_fowler May I offer an observation?
leonard_hofstadter What the hell? How long has she been here?
sheldon_cooper Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
leonard_hofstadter That was two hours ago.
sheldon_cooper As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.
sheldon_cooper Did you know that, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper I did.
amy_farrah_fowler I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
leonard_hofstadter No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
sheldon_cooper Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Right.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.
sheldon_cooper Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Keep going. I’m listening.
amy_farrah_fowler That was rude.
sheldon_cooper He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
amy_farrah_fowler Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
sheldon_cooper Let’s make that our word of the day.
amy_farrah_fowler Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.
amy_farrah_fowler Wait. I have a request.
sheldon_cooper Yes?
amy_farrah_fowler I’d like you to meet my mother.
sheldon_cooper I see. Can I get back to you on that?
amy_farrah_fowler Certainly. Good night.
sheldon_cooper Good night. Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, what?
sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. So?
sheldon_cooper What does that mean?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?
sheldon_cooper Uh-huh.
leonard_hofstadter You can’t say that anymore.
sheldon_cooper Wait. What?
leonard_hofstadter Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
sheldon_cooper I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
leonard_hofstadter Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?
sheldon_cooper Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.
leonard_hofstadter That is insane.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, good luck.
sheldon_cooper Wait! What am I supposed to do?
leonard_hofstadter Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie.
leonard_hofstadter All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
sheldon_cooper Screwed.
leonard_hofstadter There you go.
sheldon_cooper Amy’s right. He is tedious.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, get the door!
howard_wolowitz Why can’t you get it?
debbie_wolowitz You know I’m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I’m like an upside-down volcano here.
howard_wolowitz Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that.
leonard_hofstadter The volcano thing? No.
howard_wolowitz What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s just something I threw on.
howard_wolowitz I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts.
howard_wolowitz So, how’d it go?
leonard_hofstadter It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.
howard_wolowitz Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.
leonard_hofstadter I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.
howard_wolowitz You that desperate?
leonard_hofstadter No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.
debbie_wolowitz Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?
leonard_hofstadter To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I know what you mean.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?
sheldon_cooper As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
leonard_hofstadter What are you working on?
sheldon_cooper I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, you’re going off the grid.
sheldon_cooper Exactly.
leonard_hofstadter The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
leonard_hofstadter What if she just comes over?
sheldon_cooper She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
leonard_hofstadter You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.
leonard_hofstadter Who is it?
amy_farrah_fowler Amy Farrah Fowler.
sheldon_cooper Darn! She found me!
leonard_hofstadter She’s been here before.
sheldon_cooper The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want to do?
sheldon_cooper Tell her I’m not here.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, where are you?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here.
amy_farrah_fowler All right.
sheldon_cooper Way to go on the details.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.
howard_wolowitz Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
bernadette_rostenkowski We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.
bernadette_rostenkowski Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
joy Hi. You don’t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.
leonard_hofstadter Uh…
joy Aah! Time’s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I’m hilarious.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?
joy Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
joy Number 42!
leonard_hofstadter Whoa!
bernadette_rostenkowski Isn’t she a pip?
sheldon_cooper Proxima Centauri’s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard’s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that’s wrong! EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.
joy This lobster’s good on the way down and the way up.
leonard_hofstadter Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound.
joy Hey, this is a date, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yep, it is.
joy 73!
leonard_hofstadter Whoa!
joy Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls’ room and take a wicked whiz.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll go with you.
joy Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.
howard_wolowitz I think she likes you.
sheldon_cooper EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Rats!
amy_farrah_fowler I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
sheldon_cooper No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.
amy_farrah_fowler In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that I’m in a relationship.
sheldon_cooper So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
amy_farrah_fowler Precisely.
sheldon_cooper And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.
amy_farrah_fowler I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
sheldon_cooper Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me.
sheldon_cooper My apologies. Good night, Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Good night, Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you.
leonard_hofstadter Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.
howard_wolowitz Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten.
leonard_hofstadter I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.
howard_wolowitz Not that I’ve ever seen.
leonard_hofstadter It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
joy Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.
leonard_hofstadter Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…
joy Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin’s wedding.
leonard_hofstadter You’re asking me out?
joy Yeah. And it’s an open bar, so I’ll probably be giving it away.
leonard_hofstadter I look forward to it.
mrs_fowler It’s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn’t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.
sheldon_cooper I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
mrs_fowler What?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.
mrs_fowler Amy, what is he saying?
amy_farrah_fowler You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina.
mrs_fowler Oh!
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.
sheldon_cooper Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
