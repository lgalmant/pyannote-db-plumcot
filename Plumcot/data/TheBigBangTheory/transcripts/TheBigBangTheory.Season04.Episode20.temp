dr_brian_greene My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there’s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.
sheldon Hysterical.
amy I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly.
sheldon Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
greene You can think about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can’t order the corresponding dish in column B. That’s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.
sheldon Ba-dum-bump.
amy Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.
sheldon Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you.
amy Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.
sheldon Forgive my language, but poppycock.
amy What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?
sheldon Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?
amy Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
sheldon I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?
greene Yes?
sheldon You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
greene Yes, in part.
sheldon Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?
greene Excuse me?
sheldon Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.
leonard Nice shot.
sheldon Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
leonard Perfect.
sheldon I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?
leonard Shooting at a target?
sheldon With what?
leonard An arrow.
sheldon Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
leonard I’m not going to do that, Sheldon.
sheldon Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.
leonard Really? How could you tell?
sheldon She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
leonard You don’t say?
sheldon Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
leonard So, what’s the gossip?
sheldon Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.
leonard Fine, don’t tell me.
sheldon All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
leonard Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
sheldon Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.
leonard Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games.
leonard – Priya, can I come in?
priya Sure.
leonard Oh, God.
priya What?
leonard It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
priya What, what did I do?
leonard Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
priya You’re kidding.
leonard It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
priya That’s madness.
leonard I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.
priya You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.
leonard Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape.
priya Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?
leonard Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?
priya You’ll need to explain the game to me.
leonard Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.
priya Well, regardless, I’ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She’s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.
leonard Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.
priya Why not?
leonard Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.
priya Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news.
leonard Really? Who?
priya My brother. He’s got a big crush on Bernadette.
leonard What? You’re kidding!
priya Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
leonard Wow, that’s hard to believe.
priya Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What’s that piece of tape?
leonard Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.
leonard Hey!
penny Hey! How’s it going?
leonard Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
penny ‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
leonard I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
penny Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better.
leonard Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
penny You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
leonard I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
penny Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?
leonard No.
penny Well, then who?
leonard I can’t say.
penny Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.
leonard Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.
penny You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.
leonard You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
penny In confidence!
raj Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?
mrs_koothrappali We’re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can’t complain.
dr_koothrappali So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?
priya It’s fine. But if I’m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.
mrs_koothrappali Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren’t you making your sister comfortable?
raj I am making her comfortable. Besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway.
dr_koothrappali What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?
priya It’s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.
mrs_koothrappali Please tell me you’re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?
dr_koothrappali Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that’s not a bad way to go. He’s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don’t drink a lot.
raj It, it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.
priya For now.
raj What does that mean?
priya I’ll tell you later.
raj Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
mrs_koothrappali Who’s Bernadette?
dr_koothrappali Doesn’t sound Jewish.
mrs_koothrappali You can’t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.
dr_koothrappali Okay, we’re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.
priya Thank you, Daddy.
raj Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…
priya Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.
raj Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!
priya Well you should have kept your mouth shut.
raj Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!
sheldon I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
leonard Oh, yeah? What about it?
sheldon That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains.
raj Are you listening to this guy?
howard Hmm? Oh, I’m sorry. I was somewhere else.
leonard Lucky bastard.
sheldon Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
raj So what’s up?
howard It’s a Bernadette thing.
raj Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay.
leonard Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.
raj Yeah. Good or devastating.
howard I’m gonna ask her to marry me.
leonard Marry you?
raj What?
howard Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
leonard Oh, I’d wait.
raj No rush, no rush.
howard Oh, great. It’s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what’d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It’s one of the reasons I love her.
leonard Man, he’s going to be blindsided.
raj I know. It’ll be awful.
sheldon Why are you smiling?
leonard Yeah, Raj, why?
raj Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place.
sheldon Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo.
amy Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
sheldon No.
amy Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
sheldon Have you learned anything?
amy Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
sheldon If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking.
amy By all means.
sheldon Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
amy I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
sheldon I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.
amy It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
sheldon I’m familiar with everything, but go on.
amy Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
sheldon I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
amy I should think so. That’s gold.
sheldon Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
amy Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
sheldon It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
amy We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
sheldon And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
amy Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
sheldon Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.
penny Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?
amy Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I’m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum’s the word. Gotta go.
bernadette Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?
raj I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark.
bernadette Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?
raj No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
bernadette Yeah.
raj Me, too. Good times.
penny Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.
bernadette Oh, thanks.
raj This was nice.
penny What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.
raj I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.
penny Well, I know that. How do you know that?
raj My sister told me.
penny Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.
raj None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
penny Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.
raj What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
penny All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.
raj Shut your ass!
penny Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me.
raj How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
penny I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
raj Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hey.
leonard Hope you’re hungry.
sheldon Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context.
leonard Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
sheldon Yes, I believe so.
leonard Good, good. Everything okay between you two?
sheldon Yes. Why do you ask?
leonard No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
sheldon Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
leonard No. That’s not what he meant.
sheldon Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.
leonard Yeah, you do. You dog, you.
sheldon Did you get that?
amy Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
sheldon This is moving faster than we thought.
amy Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
sheldon I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.
amy Slow down, Sheldon. I’m not quite there yet.
leonard Pass the soy sauce.
howard Sure.
amy Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
sheldon Pun intended?
amy No. Happy accident.
sheldon This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
amy I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
sheldon Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.
amy Pun intended?
sheldon I’m sorry. What pun?
amy Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.
sheldon I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is.
howard Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can’t think of a better time than when I’m with all my friends.
leonard Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times.
raj Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.
howard Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…
bernadette Oh, God. What’s happening?
howard I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…
bernadette Howard, let me just stop you right here.
raj This is it.
bernadette Yes.
howard Yes, what?
bernadette Yes, I will marry you.
howard You will?
raj You will?
bernadette I will. I will!
howard Oh, I love you so much.
bernadette Oh, I love you, too.
leonard Congratulations!
priya Oh, it’s so exciting.
amy I wonder what changed her mind.
sheldon Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
amy As good an explanation as any.
leonard That’s great.
penny Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?
amy Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word.
leonard You’re pregnant?
amy Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
