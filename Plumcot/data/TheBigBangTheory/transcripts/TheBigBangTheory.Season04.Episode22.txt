amy_farrah_fowler I must say, Penny, this is great fun.
penny Glad you’re enjoying yourself.
amy_farrah_fowler Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before.
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
bernadette_rostenkowski Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
amy_farrah_fowler You okay in there, bestie?
penny I’m fine.
amy_farrah_fowler The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine
penny Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.
amy_farrah_fowler She always this crabby when she urinates?
bernadette_rostenkowski We’re really not that close.
penny Screw it. I’ll go later.
amy_farrah_fowler And I’ll be right by your side.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
penny Oh, that’s nice.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.
bernadette_rostenkowski You think?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, what makes me the weakest member?
amy_farrah_fowler Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.
penny Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
bernadette_rostenkowski It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, no. You have to go.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
amy_farrah_fowler You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage.
penny Wait. What are you talking about?
amy_farrah_fowler By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
penny Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
amy_farrah_fowler How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, see you later.
sheldon_cooper Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
leonard_hofstadter That is good news. Bye.
sheldon_cooper Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
leonard_hofstadter That, that’s brilliant.
sheldon_cooper It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?
sheldon_cooper When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.
leonard_hofstadter All right.
sheldon_cooper Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.
leonard_hofstadter Elegant.
sheldon_cooper That’s because it’s simple.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
sheldon_cooper And…
leonard_hofstadter And what?
sheldon_cooper And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
sheldon_cooper Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines.
leonard_hofstadter Got it. Bye.
sheldon_cooper You know I’m right.
leonard_hofstadter I think he’s getting worse.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my metatarsal are barking.
leonard_hofstadter You okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.
leonard_hofstadter Very pretty.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
leonard_hofstadter Hadn’t really thought about it.
amy_farrah_fowler Look.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure. Very… prominent.
amy_farrah_fowler Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. How did you know?
amy_farrah_fowler I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
priya_koothrappali Hey, you.
leonard_hofstadter Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?
raj_koothrappali The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
priya_koothrappali Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?
raj_koothrappali I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
leonard_hofstadter Really? In front of your sister?
priya_koothrappali We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?
penny No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.
penny The what?
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”
penny Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
amy_farrah_fowler I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.
penny None?
amy_farrah_fowler I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
penny Wh… What the hell did she say?
amy_farrah_fowler She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what.
penny That bitch!
amy_farrah_fowler How do you want to handle it?
penny Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
amy_farrah_fowler Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
penny What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. 3-D?
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s what I hear.
howard_wolowitz Then the studio must have real faith in it.
leonard_hofstadter Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
priya_koothrappali Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
leonard_hofstadter No.
priya_koothrappali Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
priya_koothrappali What other thing?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?
howard_wolowitz I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s also dating an astronaut.
priya_koothrappali Wow. That’s very impressive.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
sheldon_cooper Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. Will the two of you excuse me?
raj_koothrappali I need a hug.
sheldon_cooper Sorry, I have company.
raj_koothrappali Come on, Sheldon, open the door.
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to hug you.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.
sheldon_cooper Blue, as in depressed.
raj_koothrappali Well, not so much depressed as lonely.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know what colour lonely is.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.
raj_koothrappali Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
sheldon_cooper All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all.
raj_koothrappali What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m working on my three-person chess game.
raj_koothrappali Oh, cool. Can I play?
sheldon_cooper It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.
raj_koothrappali No, thank you. I’m fine.
sheldon_cooper It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
raj_koothrappali I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
raj_koothrappali I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
sheldon_cooper The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared.
sheldon_cooper Yellow. Go ahead.
raj_koothrappali A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
sheldon_cooper Fascinating. What’s in it?
raj_koothrappali I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
sheldon_cooper I like cows.
raj_koothrappali That’s not the point.
sheldon_cooper It was its own point. Go on.
raj_koothrappali I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
sheldon_cooper Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
howard_wolowitz Most of those guys live in Texas.
bernadette_rostenkowski Obviously, this one doesn’t.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!
howard_wolowitz Fine.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
howard_wolowitz I’m not grilling you, I was just curious.
leonard_hofstadter I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?
priya_koothrappali I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s a consultant.
leonard_hofstadter I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
bernadette_rostenkowski He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?
howard_wolowitz It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?
penny All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send
amy_farrah_fowler Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. What do you got for me, wildebeest?
bernadette_rostenkowski I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.
amy_farrah_fowler Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay. We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?
bernadette_rostenkowski In the bathroom.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?
bernadette_rostenkowski They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.
amy_farrah_fowler Just change the subject.
bernadette_rostenkowski I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.
penny What?
bernadette_rostenkowski They said something about going there this summer.
penny What, are they getting engaged?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!
amy_farrah_fowler What astronaut story?
bernadette_rostenkowski You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.
amy_farrah_fowler I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, it’s hysterical.
penny All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.
amy_farrah_fowler Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
penny Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t want to do this anymore!
penny Don’t you quit on us!
howard_wolowitz Bernie, you okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski It was an architect!
raj_koothrappali Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
sheldon_cooper I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
raj_koothrappali Okay, let’s see if this drug works.
woman_at_table#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Can I help you?
raj_koothrappali Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?
raj_koothrappali India.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there.
raj_koothrappali It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Uh, okay, sure. Why not?
raj_koothrappali My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Hi.
sheldon_cooper Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 What’s he observing?
raj_koothrappali We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.
sheldon_cooper All right.
raj_koothrappali And what is your name?
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Angela.
raj_koothrappali Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.
angela You’re cute.
sheldon_cooper I’d like to buy a scone.
server#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 Oh, I’m sorry, we’re out. We have muffins.
sheldon_cooper They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.
angela What are you doing?
raj_koothrappali Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
angela I…
sheldon_cooper They were out of scones.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, I’m talking to someone. You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.
angela Oh, my God.
raj_koothrappali Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!
priya_koothrappali Who wants some more coffee?
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, yeah.
howard_wolowitz Sure.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let me help you.
howard_wolowitz Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
leonard_hofstadter Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?
bernadette_rostenkowski This trip to India sounds fun.
priya_koothrappali Yeah, I think it will be.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
priya_koothrappali A little. They’re very old-fashioned.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?
priya_koothrappali Oh, God, no. We’re not there yet.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
priya_koothrappali You’ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes. Are you writing a book?
priya_koothrappali Why are you getting upset?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.
priya_koothrappali What’s up with you? Bernadette?
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school!
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?
leonard_hofstadter I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
sheldon_cooper My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
howard_wolowitz Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
sheldon_cooper When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
raj_koothrappali Hey, I’ve got winners.
