sheldon_cooper It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!
leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doing?
sheldon_cooper I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
penny What am I smelling?
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.
penny That’s not what the forest smells like.
sheldon_cooper Well, how would I know?
leonard_hofstadter Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
sheldon_cooper Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
sheldon_cooper Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
penny Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?
sheldon_cooper You may need this more than I do.
amy_farrah_fowler Here’s your tea.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?
sheldon_cooper Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…
penny You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.
leonard_hofstadter Because he’s hitting on you?
penny She.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good.
penny But I could get her.
amy_farrah_fowler We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.
leonard_hofstadter You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
penny Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them.
sheldon_cooper I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.
penny I’ll see if it’s available.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.
sheldon_cooper Are you trying to manipulate me?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Well done, it worked, we’re going.
amy_farrah_fowler Yay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Raj, give me a bag.
raj_koothrappali No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
howard_wolowitz Hey, where you been?
bernadette_rostenkowski Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.
howard_wolowitz Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes and yes.
howard_wolowitz I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet.
raj_koothrappali Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think.
howard_wolowitz And it just got weird.
penny Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, one sec.
penny Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?
leonard_hofstadter I bought a baseball cap.
penny I can see that. What team did you get?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.
penny Well, we’ll be in the woods.
sheldon_cooper I’m ready to go.
leonard_hofstadter Anything you’d like to say to him?
penny Nice hat, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you so mean to me?
howard_wolowitz What the hell are you watching?
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
howard_wolowitz Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
howard_wolowitz All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.
howard_wolowitz Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?
bernadette_rostenkowski Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.
howard_wolowitz So he can be part of the experience?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
howard_wolowitz I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up.
penny It’s so cute and rustic up here.
leonard_hofstadter I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.
sheldon_cooper Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you ever been off the grid before?
sheldon_cooper Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
leonard_hofstadter I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
howard_wolowitz Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.
bernadette_rostenkowski Leave it alone. He means well.
howard_wolowitz So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, not really.
howard_wolowitz And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s just trying to be supportive.
howard_wolowitz Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
bernadette_rostenkowski You saw him carrying that.
howard_wolowitz Astronauts saw him carrying that.
penny This place is great.
leonard_hofstadter So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
penny Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?
amy_farrah_fowler On the other hand, safety first.
amy_farrah_fowler Wow, it’s really coming down.
penny This sucks.
leonard_hofstadter And there goes our hike.
sheldon_cooper Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.
penny You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.
leonard_hofstadter Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter You’ll wish it would kill you.
amy_farrah_fowler So what do we do now?
leonard_hofstadter They have some board games.
sheldon_cooper Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.
penny Hey, let’s light a fire.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, that sounds cozy.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.
sheldon_cooper Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.
leonard_hofstadter I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
sheldon_cooper That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
leonard_hofstadter Right. So all we need is to…
penny Got it.
leonard_hofstadter A scientist made that.
howard_wolowitz Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.
raj_koothrappali Please, my pleasure.
bernadette_rostenkowski And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.
howard_wolowitz But we have to set some boundaries.
raj_koothrappali I don’t understand.
howard_wolowitz The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off.
howard_wolowitz Thanks for understanding.
raj_koothrappali Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
howard_wolowitz You need some help?
raj_koothrappali No, I got it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, Raj, wait.
raj_koothrappali Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
penny Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?
sheldon_cooper Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.
penny Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
leonard_hofstadter To be fair, good at both.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s the game?
penny All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve never played that before.
sheldon_cooper Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?
penny Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…
amy_farrah_fowler She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.
penny Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
sheldon_cooper So I drink.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s only if you’ve done it.
sheldon_cooper Got it.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.
penny Sheldon, what did you do?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m surprised you would do that.
sheldon_cooper No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.
penny What, he arrested you for that?
sheldon_cooper No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
penny And then you got arrested.
sheldon_cooper Oh, and how.
howard_wolowitz I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
howard_wolowitz But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
howard_wolowitz What? Are you gonna cry?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t tell anymore.
howard_wolowitz I’ll go get him.
bernadette_rostenkowski And bring back the bear.
leonard_hofstadter This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
penny How?
leonard_hofstadter Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.
penny Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.
leonard_hofstadter Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.
sheldon_cooper Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler You know the rules. Drink.
penny Yeah, go ahead.
leonard_hofstadter That’s right.
sheldon_cooper All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
penny I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.
penny We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
leonard_hofstadter What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?
sheldon_cooper I’m calling it. I won.
raj_koothrappali I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.
howard_wolowitz No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.
bernadette_rostenkowski I hear that.
raj_koothrappali Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?
howard_wolowitz Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.
raj_koothrappali Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Of course.
raj_koothrappali Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
howard_wolowitz Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.
penny How long have you had this secret account?
leonard_hofstadter A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.
penny Well, how much you got in there?
leonard_hofstadter Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
penny My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?
leonard_hofstadter No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.
penny What good is it if you don’t use it?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.
penny Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.
leonard_hofstadter Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
penny I hate my job.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Why?
penny Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.
leonard_hofstadter Why didn’t you tell me?
penny Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not true.
penny Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
leonard_hofstadter If that’s what you want to do, yes.
penny Well, it’s not what I want to do.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yes.
penny Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.
leonard_hofstadter Well, that is the grown-up thing.
penny I guess.
leonard_hofstadter I love you.
penny I love you, too.
leonard_hofstadter You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.
penny Well, guess I gotta drink.
howard_wolowitz All right, here we go.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not hearing anything.
howard_wolowitz Well, give me a second.
raj_koothrappali Are you sure you can do this?
howard_wolowitz Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?
raj_koothrappali I buried it there, so we could go home.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait, that’s it.
raj_koothrappali Wow.
bernadette_rostenkowski Isn’t that the best?
raj_koothrappali You guys made a person.
howard_wolowitz We did.
raj_koothrappali And I like to think I helped.
howard_wolowitz You didn’t.
sheldon_cooper Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.
amy_farrah_fowler Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
sheldon_cooper Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.
amy_farrah_fowler Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
sheldon_cooper Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.
amy_farrah_fowler Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, we all have a past.
