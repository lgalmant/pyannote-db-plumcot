leonard Oh, thank God we’re home.
howard I can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
raj It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
sheldon I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.
sheldon Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet. Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
leonard I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.
sheldon Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. Hello, old friend. Daddy’s home.
penny Leonard, you’re back.
leonard Yeah, I just stopped by to say… Yeah, so, hi!
penny Hi!
howard Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.
raj Yeah, it was first come, first served.
sheldon I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions.
howard Great.
raj Thanks.
sheldon Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.
raj We have to tell him.
sheldon Tell me what?
howard Damn his Vulcan hearing.
sheldon You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?
howard Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
sheldon If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea.
howard Yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.
sheldon If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
raj It’s not about that.
howard And we agreed to never speak of it again.
sheldon So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
howard He’s speaking about it.
raj For me, it was a bonding moment.
howard Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?
raj I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
howard That’s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.
sheldon Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.
howard Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
raj He just went colon, capital O.
sheldon You tampered with my experiment?
howard We had to.
raj It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
sheldon Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
howard Actually, it was his idea.
sheldon Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
penny I missed you so much.
leonard I missed you, too.
penny I couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone.
leonard Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask.
sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard Do not make a sound.
sheldon Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
leonard Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Oh, this is ridiculous. What?
sheldon Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?
penny It’s great to see you too. Come on in.
sheldon Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
leonard Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
penny Okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?
sheldon What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
penny Is that true?
leonard It was the only way to make him happy.
penny Why did you have to make him happy?
leonard Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
sheldon That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
leonard No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
sheldon Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe.
leonard Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal.
sheldon You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal
penny Oh, the poor thing.
leonard Yeah, I feel terrible.
penny Wait, wait. Aren’t you going to go talk to him?
leonard What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here.
penny No, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. I will.
leonard Man, I cannot catch a break.
penny Hey. Do you want to talk?
sheldon About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
penny Oh, hon… Uh… Soft kitty, warm kitty…
sheldon That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
penny Oh. Sorry. I don’t know your sad song.
sheldon I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
penny Well, you know, I do understand what you’re going through.
sheldon Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
penny Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol’ slutbag.
sheldon Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
penny Well, they’re pretty tasty.
sheldon And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
penny Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?
sheldon I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
raj I like the new look.
howard Thanks. I call it the Clooney.
raj I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how’s Sheldon doing?
leonard Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better.
howard If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally… you know.
leonard Howard…
howard Personally, I don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.
leonard Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.
howard He says they didn’t do it.
leonard Sheldon, over here.
howard What are you doing?
raj I feel bad for the guy.
leonard Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
sheldon Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.
leonard Come on. We said we were sorry.
sheldon It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
kripke Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.
sheldon You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
kripke That’s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.
sheldon All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
kripke Off a cwiff.
sheldon My credibility may have been damaged…
kripke Compwetely wecked.
sheldon But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
kripke Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein’s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you’re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.
sheldon Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
leonard So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
raj Well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out.
penny Hi.
leonard Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this.
penny Oh, Leonard, you shouldn’t have. Oh, boy! What is it?
leonard It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
penny Are you serious?
leonard Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
penny Oh, my God. That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that I didn’t understand.
leonard It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…
howard Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.
leonard Man, I can not catch a break.
penny So, how do you know he ran away?
howard Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I’m running away.
leonard Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.
penny Well, Leonard, aren’t you going to do something?
leonard Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.
penny Well, you’re not gonna go with them?
leonard Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!
howard Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we’re done.
leonard Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya.
penny Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He’s your best friend.
leonard Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
penny No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
leonard Really?
penny Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
leonard Maybe you can.
penny Go.
raj Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?
mrs_cooper Here you go, Shelly.
sheldon Thanks, Mom.
mrs_cooper Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.
sheldon Aw, Mom.
mrs_cooper This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…
sheldon Fed.
mrs_cooper Give us, Lord, our daily…
sheldon Bread.
mrs_cooper Please know that we are truly…
sheldon Grateful.
mrs_cooper For every cup and every…
sheldon Plateful.
mrs_cooper Amen. Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?
sheldon My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
mrs_cooper Whatever. Jesus still loves you.
sheldon Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
mrs_cooper Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he’s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?
sheldon They’re not my friends.
mrs_cooper All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.
sheldon That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
mrs_cooper Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.
leonard I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
howard Hello? I’m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys’ large they had.
raj I’m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?
leonard Saloons?
raj Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.
howard This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
raj I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
leonard What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
leonard Will you please take that stupid hat off?
howard No, I want to blend in.
raj To what? Toy Story?
mrs_cooper Hi, boys.
howard Howdy, ma’am.
mrs_cooper Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.
leonard – We took the red-eye.
mrs_cooper Well, come on in.
howard Thank you kindly.
mrs_cooper Can I… Can I get you something to drink?
leonard Uh, no, thank you.
howard If y’all don’t mind, I got a hankerin’ for a Lone Star beer.
mrs_cooper There’s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.
howard Sorry. I’ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.
mrs_cooper You’ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn’t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who’s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she’d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.
leonard Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.
mrs_cooper A girl?
leonard Uh, yes, ma’am.
mrs_cooper Oh, good. I’ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.
sheldon What are they doing here?
leonard We came to apologize.
howard Again.
leonard And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back.
leonard No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.
mrs_cooper You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion.
sheldon Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact.
mrs_cooper And that is your opinion.
sheldon I forgive you. Let’s go home.
mrs_cooper Don’t tell me prayer doesn’t work.
leonard How about that? I finally caught a break.
penny Uh-huh.
leonard You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
penny Sure.
leonard Why does it have to get weird?
penny I don’t know.
leonard I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…
penny Leonard?
leonard Yeah?
penny It’s weird.
leonard Totally.
