leonard_hofstadter I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.
howard_wolowitz We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.
leonard_hofstadter My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.
raj_koothrappali Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
sheldon_cooper If I could keep my Gmail account, I’d be okay with that.
barry_kripke – Hewwo, fewwas.
all@ Hey.
barry_kripke Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman’s office was?
howard_wolowitz Yeah?
barry_kripke Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.
howard_wolowitz That’s terrible.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God.
barry_kripke In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.
sheldon_cooper If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.
howard_wolowitz Show a little compassion, a man died.
barry_kripke And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.
raj_koothrappali Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
sheldon_cooper Pchew!
barry_kripke If you need my nose, you’ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.
howard_wolowitz You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?
leonard_hofstadter No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure, I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.
sheldon_cooper Raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you are.
sheldon_cooper Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
penny So tenured means a job for life?
leonard_hofstadter Yup.
penny You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, not really.
penny Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
sheldon_cooper While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off.
amy_farrah_fowler Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
sheldon_cooper Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler Do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?
sheldon_cooper Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.
raj_koothrappali It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.
howard_wolowitz Money from family does come with strings attached.
raj_koothrappali You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think that’s enough wine for now.
leonard_hofstadter I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.
penny She’d be proud, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.
sheldon_cooper My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.
amy_farrah_fowler Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.
sheldon_cooper Or, the chainsaw.
raj_koothrappali And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m gonna make some coffee.
penny So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?
leonard_hofstadter I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
penny That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?
penny Oh, good, you heard me.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.
sheldon_cooper Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
amy_farrah_fowler You don’t say.
sheldon_cooper But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.
amy_farrah_fowler Is that a problem?
sheldon_cooper Well…
sheldon_cooper Even you. You’re a slave.
janine_davis I’m a what?
sheldon_cooper I’m not sure, it could go either way.
leonard_hofstadter Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.
janine_davis Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
janine_davis Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
janine_davis Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
janine_davis Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?
janine_davis You push start.
leonard_hofstadter Right. This one might be broken.
janine_davis You have to move.
leonard_hofstadter Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?
janine_davis Yep. I got to get a home gym.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring.
janine_davis All right, I’ll keep an eye out for that.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
barry_kripke Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in… ever.
leonard_hofstadter Go away.
barry_kripke Janine the Machine, wet’s do this!
janine_davis Hey, Barry.
leonard_hofstadter Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.
barry_kripke I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.
janine_davis Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.
barry_kripke No, my pweasure.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it to you.
barry_kripke Aw wight, I’m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?
janine_davis Let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
janine_davis You okay?
leonard_hofstadter Call someone.
raj_koothrappali Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.
janine_davis Oh, come on.
raj_koothrappali Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.
sheldon_cooper Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis?
janine_davis God, they’re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
sheldon_cooper Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.
janine_davis Uh, Dr. Cooper, that’s not necessary.
sheldon_cooper It’s too late. Get ready to like me.
janine_davis Roots?
sheldon_cooper The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
janine_davis Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?
sheldon_cooper Um… Well… You are black, right?
janine_davis This meeting has come to an end.
sheldon_cooper Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.
leonard_hofstadter Gentlemen.
raj_koothrappali Where have you been?
leonard_hofstadter Nurse’s office.
howard_wolowitz Asthma attack?
leonard_hofstadter Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I’m fine, though.
howard_wolowitz You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know.
leonard_hofstadter Probably not.
sheldon_cooper Barely knew him.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, meerkats.
sheldon_cooper I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.
amy_farrah_fowler Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.
sheldon_cooper First of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.
amy_farrah_fowler It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
sheldon_cooper Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
sheldon_cooper Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.
amy_farrah_fowler Of course it would. I’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.
leonard_hofstadter Do anything interesting today?
penny Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.
penny Oh, what a jerk.
leonard_hofstadter I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
penny Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.
penny Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.
penny Oh, then you all can get tenure.
raj_koothrappali Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay, let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals.
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?
sheldon_cooper Sad.
amy_farrah_fowler The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?
sheldon_cooper Glad.
amy_farrah_fowler Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
sheldon_cooper Bad. However…
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Bad.
raj_koothrappali Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
sheldon_cooper You’re here.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.
sheldon_cooper So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
leonard_hofstadter Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either.
raj_koothrappali I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.
amy_farrah_fowler I’d like to know why Penny’s here.
penny I’m here to support my man, just like you.
sheldon_cooper What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?
leonard_hofstadter Do it.
sheldon_cooper What? Did she do it yet?
amy_farrah_fowler She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard’s cause.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand there. Take your breasts out.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, meerkat fight!
amy_farrah_fowler You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?
leonard_hofstadter Way to hit ’em with both barrels.
raj_koothrappali You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.
sheldon_cooper Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
sheldon_cooper Okay, because that was not clear.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper What? That was ambiguous.
raj_koothrappali Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
sheldon_cooper Um…
howard_wolowitz You could talk some smack about his mother.
sheldon_cooper Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know what you’re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.
howard_wolowitz So is tenure.
bernadette_rostenkowski Walk.
leonard_hofstadter I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
raj_koothrappali You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
leonard_hofstadter How about it, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper What do you think I should do?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends.
sheldon_cooper I don’t want any more, but let’s go.
barry_kripke Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.
janine_davis I could not ask you to do that.
barry_kripke Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.
leonard_hofstadter No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, screw it. I’m going in.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.
amy_farrah_fowler Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
sheldon_cooper Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? I know you’re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.
janine_davis What?
sheldon_cooper I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.
janine_davis Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.
janine_davis You didn’t bring another gift, did you?
sheldon_cooper No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.
janine_davis Good.
sheldon_cooper Anyway, thank you.
janine_davis You’re welcome. I’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, right on, sister.
