leonard_hofstadter Who wants the last dumpling?
penny Ooh, me.
sheldon_cooper Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.
penny Thank you all for this high honour.
sheldon_cooper I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.
howard_wolowitz All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go. This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. Yeah, well, now it means her.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay if he wants to come.
howard_wolowitz Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.
penny All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?
howard_wolowitz Neither of them are close.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.
penny Okay, I’m not driving him.
sheldon_cooper No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.
leonard_hofstadter Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
amy_farrah_fowler Not really, no.
leonard_hofstadter All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.
leonard_hofstadter Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler Yo.
leonard_hofstadter You okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, sure.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you were reading.
amy_farrah_fowler I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.
leonard_hofstadter I, I’m fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
leonard_hofstadter What, who told you that?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, most recently my gynaecologist.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you stay as long as you’d like.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
howard_wolowitz Which side do you come down on?
sheldon_cooper I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.
howard_wolowitz Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
howard_wolowitz First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
howard_wolowitz Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.
bernadette_rostenkowski Is she moving out?
howard_wolowitz Why would she move out? It’s her house.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?
sheldon_cooper Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.
howard_wolowitz Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
howard_wolowitz Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, take me home.
howard_wolowitz Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
bernadette_rostenkowski Take me home now.
howard_wolowitz Movie theatre.
raj_koothrappali Mmmmmm.
sheldon_cooper Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do.
amy_farrah_fowler How was your shower?
leonard_hofstadter It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?
leonard_hofstadter Not really. Is that my yearbook?
amy_farrah_fowler Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
amy_farrah_fowler If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.
leonard_hofstadter Aw.
amy_farrah_fowler Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.
sheldon_cooper Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.
leonard_hofstadter Rough night, Casey Jones?
sheldon_cooper You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
leonard_hofstadter What’s in the bag?
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, sure. That’d be nice.
amy_farrah_fowler Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
leonard_hofstadter Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.
sheldon_cooper Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
amy_farrah_fowler Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.
sheldon_cooper Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
howard_wolowitz I’ll get it!
debbie_wolowitz Could you get it?
howard_wolowitz I said I’m getting it!
debbie_wolowitz Fine, I’ll get it!
howard_wolowitz I got it! Oh, hi.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.
debbie_wolowitz I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!
howard_wolowitz The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.
bernadette_rostenkowski And your mom would be okay with that?
howard_wolowitz Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?
debbie_wolowitz Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?
howard_wolowitz See? She’s good with it.
debbie_wolowitz Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!
sheldon_cooper All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.
penny You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
amy_farrah_fowler Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?
penny Really? For a wedding?
amy_farrah_fowler Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
leonard_hofstadter Ready.
penny Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
sheldon_cooper Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.
amy_farrah_fowler I got you this to give to me.
penny Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.
amy_farrah_fowler I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.
penny Put the corsage on her.
leonard_hofstadter Amy, this is for you.
amy_farrah_fowler When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
sheldon_cooper All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
howard_wolowitz So, dinner went nice.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?
howard_wolowitz Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.
debbie_wolowitz Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.
debbie_wolowitz You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!
howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?
debbie_wolowitz Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God.
howard_wolowitz Relax, it’ll be fine.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
debbie_wolowitz Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!
amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to dance?
leonard_hofstadter No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
amy_farrah_fowler Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.
leonard_hofstadter That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
amy_farrah_fowler I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not moody. I’m fun.
amy_farrah_fowler You have any evidence to support that statement?
leonard_hofstadter Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine, what do you suggest?
amy_farrah_fowler We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.
leonard_hofstadter Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry, I’ll lead.
amy_farrah_fowler Howard?
howard_wolowitz Ready for bed?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!
debbie_wolowitz You don’t know that! I just sat down!
howard_wolowitz Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!
debbie_wolowitz She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!
howard_wolowitz Problem solved.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.
debbie_wolowitz Ha! The eagle has landed!
howard_wolowitz And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.
amy_farrah_fowler There we go, last floor.
leonard_hofstadter I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
amy_farrah_fowler The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
leonard_hofstadter I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re welcome.
leonard_hofstadter And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
amy_farrah_fowler I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.
leonard_hofstadter Well, okay. Again, thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler And again, you’re welcome.
leonard_hofstadter Want to come in, have a cup of tea?
amy_farrah_fowler No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, good night.
amy_farrah_fowler Good night.
penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
amy_farrah_fowler Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
penny Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?
amy_farrah_fowler Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
penny Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?
amy_farrah_fowler The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
penny Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
amy_farrah_fowler No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart.
penny Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.
penny So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?
amy_farrah_fowler No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does.
sheldon_cooper Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds like you had a great night.
sheldon_cooper I did. How was yours?
leonard_hofstadter Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
sheldon_cooper What exactly do you mean by that?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. Ow! Why did you do that?
sheldon_cooper To send a message. She is not for you.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Not for you!
bernadette_rostenkowski Good morning, handsome.
howard_wolowitz Morning, Mom.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s me.
howard_wolowitz Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.
bernadette_rostenkowski Your mom and I made you breakfast.
howard_wolowitz Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.
debbie_wolowitz Does he like the pancakes?!
bernadette_rostenkowski He didn’t try them yet!
howard_wolowitz Is there any butter?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
howard_wolowitz Oh.
debbie_wolowitz So, what’s the word?
bernadette_rostenkowski He wants butter!
debbie_wolowitz It’s butter-flavoured syrup
bernadette_rostenkowski I just told him that!
howard_wolowitz I don’t need any butter.
bernadette_rostenkowski If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.
howard_wolowitz Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself.
