sheldon Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
amy Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?
sheldon Vexillology is the study of flags.
amy Cool. I think I just learned something.
sheldon Did you have fun doing it?
amy I’ll say.
sheldon Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.
amy Sweet!
sheldon Why are you waving a white flag?
amy I’m surrendering to fun.
leonard Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.
sheldon Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
leonard Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
sheldon And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
amy You okay?
sheldon No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
amy Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?
sheldon Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
amy It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
sheldon Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top.
penny That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.
leonard Me, too, I missed you.
penny You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?
leonard Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?
penny I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.
leonard Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.
penny Okay, well, maybe not that slow.
leonard How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?
penny You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.
leonard Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.
penny You mean like a beta test?
leonard Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…
penny Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
leonard No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.
penny All right. Let’s give it a shot.
leonard Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange.
penny Okay. Good night, Leonard.
leonard Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back.
sheldon Cut! Take 47.
sheldon Here’s an interesting fact about flags.
raj I will take that action.
sheldon The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.
howard Let’s see the new phone.
raj I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?
howard Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part.
raj Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.
howard Oh, yeah.
sheldon Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.
howard Oh, let me try the voice recognition.
raj Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy. Hello?
phone Hello.
raj What’s your name?
phone My name is Siri.
howard Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
raj Are you single?
siri I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking.
raj Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?
siri I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.
raj I will see you gentlemen later.
howard She is gonna break his heart.
amy For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.
sheldon Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con.
penny Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?
leonard Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.
leonard Even Doctor Who?
penny Even Doctor Who.
sheldon All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out.
leonard Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.
penny Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.
leonard Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.
penny What’s this?
leonard My bug report to you.
penny Well, that’s quite a list you got there.
leonard It’s colour coded.
penny Oh.
leonard Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?
penny Yep.
leonard So, have a good night.
penny Yep.
leonard Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
amy What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
sheldon How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
amy Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth.
raj So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?
siri I am well.
raj What are you doing right now?
siri What am I doing? I’m talking with you.
raj You have a beautiful voice.
siri Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated.
raj I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
siri Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”
raj No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?
siri My name is Siri.
raj Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.
siri Would you like me to call you Raj?
raj I’d like you to call me sexy.
siri From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?
raj Okay.
siri I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.
raj Thank you, darling.
siri You are most certainly welcome, sexy.
sheldon Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
raj I’m sorry?
sheldon You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
raj I haven’t bonded with it.
sheldon Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me.
raj It’s just a phone.
barry_kripke Cooper.
sheldon Kripke.
barry Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck.
raj Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.
siri All right, I’ll remind you.
barry You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?
barrys_siri I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant.
barry Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.
barrys_siri I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.
barry See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.
raj Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.
barry Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.
penny It’s open.
leonard Hey. You ready to go?
penny Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
leonard Can you finish it later?
penny No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
leonard Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
penny Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
leonard They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.
penny All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.
leonard Thank you.
penny Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.
leonard All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.
raj Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
howard Great.
bernadette Oh, smells amazing in here.
howard Yeah, what are we eating?
raj Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.
bernadette Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
howard Yes. His phone.
bernadette Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
howard Uh-huh.
raj Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.
siri Playing smooth jazz.
raj Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
bernadette I don’t know if I want to stay.
penny This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
leonard I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
penny Okay, you’re kind of really great.
leonard You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
penny Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.
leonard Right. Sorry, sorry.
penny And stop apologizing all the time.
leonard Right. Sorry.
penny All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?
leonard I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
penny Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.
leonard So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.
penny No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
leonard Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
penny Well, thank you for a really cool evening.
leonard Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
penny Things are looking good.
leonard So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have.
penny Good night, you.
sheldon Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.
amy Und ich bin eine pretzel!
sheldon Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
amy Mit…
sheldon Flags.
receptionist First door on the left.
raj Thank you.
siri Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me. I’m sorry. I don’t understand.
raj No!
