sheldon_cooper I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.
howard_wolowitz What a sick use of science.
raj_koothrappali Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy.
amy_farrah_fowler I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.
leonard_hofstadter Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.
howard_wolowitz Yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked.
raj_koothrappali But half-man, half-owl could fly…
sheldon_cooper The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.
howard_wolowitz So, Penny, when’s the new job start?
penny Next Monday.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?
penny Uh, not yet, but I will.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great. When?
penny I said I’ll get to it.
sheldon_cooper I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Swish.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.
penny Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know.
bernadette_rostenkowski But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
penny Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?
bernadette_rostenkowski Couldn’t hurt.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?
sheldon_cooper It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
sheldon_cooper Mrs. Davis. Guess who?
janine_davis Dr. Cooper.
sheldon_cooper That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?
janine_davis Yes. Uh, welcome back.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
janine_davis You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.
sheldon_cooper That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?
janine_davis Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.
sheldon_cooper Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?
janine_davis Currently, you’re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you’ll be able to choose whatever field of research you’d like.
sheldon_cooper But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class.
janine_davis That is correct.
sheldon_cooper So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
janine_davis Yes.
sheldon_cooper You people are sick.
penny Hey. Ready to go to lunch?
amy_farrah_fowler Just give me a minute. I’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.
penny What happens if you don’t?
amy_farrah_fowler Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
penny Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her.
amy_farrah_fowler How come?
penny Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.
penny That is not true.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
penny I told you, they’ll be right out.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, so no Bernadette.
penny Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face.
penny I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.
amy_farrah_fowler I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.
penny So, what are you saying?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?
raj_koothrappali So, I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?
howard_wolowitz Why is it your last name and her first name?
raj_koothrappali Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’d it go with human resources?
sheldon_cooper Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.
raj_koothrappali I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
sheldon_cooper What a stupid question.
leonard_hofstadter The kids are gonna love him.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.
leonard_hofstadter This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong.
sheldon_cooper Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do.
raj_koothrappali You enjoy giving people grades.
sheldon_cooper A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.
howard_wolowitz And you love the sound of your own voice.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel.
leonard_hofstadter Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.
sheldon_cooper It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.
amy_farrah_fowler Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don’t you? That’s right, say my name.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, what’s going on?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?
amy_farrah_fowler No Penny?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her.
amy_farrah_fowler Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
bernadette_rostenkowski So it’s not just me. You see it, too.
amy_farrah_fowler I do, I see it.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s outrageous.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know.
amy_farrah_fowler If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?
sheldon_cooper There is no class.
howard_wolowitz Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?
sheldon_cooper No one signed up.
leonard_hofstadter Well, that’s not your fault.
sheldon_cooper I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.
leonard_hofstadter What?
raj_koothrappali Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.
raj_koothrappali Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away.
howard_wolowitz Hey, what if I took your class?
sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, why would you do that?
raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with you?
howard_wolowitz I’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about.
raj_koothrappali Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class.
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz Yes.
sheldon_cooper How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
howard_wolowitz I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?
howard_wolowitz I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?
howard_wolowitz Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
sheldon_cooper You take that back.
howard_wolowitz No.
amy_farrah_fowler So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
amy_farrah_fowler Because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I’m in the centre now, and I love that even more.
sheldon_cooper Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.
amy_farrah_fowler But I’m just…
sheldon_cooper Not now.
amy_farrah_fowler You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm. You’re up late.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, why are you doing this?
sheldon_cooper I’m a teacher, Leonard. It’s my job.
leonard_hofstadter No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure.
leonard_hofstadter You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it.
sheldon_cooper Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.
leonard_hofstadter Might be something to think about.
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin.
howard_wolowitz Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot.
sheldon_cooper I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?
howard_wolowitz I am.
sheldon_cooper Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
howard_wolowitz It’s an inverted cycloid.
sheldon_cooper Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
howard_wolowitz That’s where I’m a little fuzzy.
sheldon_cooper Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C.
howard_wolowitz All I do is win, win, win no matter what.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz If you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I’m gonna be a crappy student. Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now…
sheldon_cooper Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
sheldon_cooper Now, where was I? Let’s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?
howard_wolowitz Making a straw.
sheldon_cooper Why?
howard_wolowitz So I can shoot you with a spitball.
sheldon_cooper You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!
howard_wolowitz Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don’t think I can do that again.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.
penny Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?
penny No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.
bernadette_rostenkowski That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I’d come by and help her study.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?
bernadette_rostenkowski I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we’re good.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal.
amy_farrah_fowler You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.
sheldon_cooper Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.
sheldon_cooper Well?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.
howard_wolowitz You reported me to human resources?
sheldon_cooper You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
howard_wolowitz Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy.
sheldon_cooper I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.
howard_wolowitz I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, try me.
howard_wolowitz Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?
sheldon_cooper Young’s modulus.
raj_koothrappali Is that right?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?
sheldon_cooper Laminate the core material.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, give him a hard one.
howard_wolowitz That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don’t know, do you? What’s the matter, smart guy? Don’t know Poiseuille’s law?
sheldon_cooper Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?
penny Headaches, dizziness and nausea.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
penny Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Want to stop here?
penny Uh, no. I can keep going.
bernadette_rostenkowski Nah, you got this. Let’s go for a drink. I’ll call Amy.
penny Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, girl.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea
raj_koothrappali 250 million years.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
howard_wolowitz Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.
sheldon_cooper Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy.
howard_wolowitz Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?
all@ The Rhombicosidodecahedron.
leonard_hofstadter We are so smart.
raj_koothrappali Why didn’t girls like us in high school?
howard_wolowitz Because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!
leonard_hofstadter Right again.
