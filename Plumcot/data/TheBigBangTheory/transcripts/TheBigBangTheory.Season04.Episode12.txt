howard_wolowitz Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn’t matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!
raj_koothrappali That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?
sheldon_cooper I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.
leonard_hofstadter I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
sheldon_cooper Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
leonard_hofstadter I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!
raj_koothrappali You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
sheldon_cooper You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good.
leonard_hofstadter Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
sheldon_cooper No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.
howard_wolowitz A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother’s house.
raj_koothrappali Where would you go?
howard_wolowitz I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
raj_koothrappali You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.
howard_wolowitz What’s that? Some weird sex thing?
raj_koothrappali No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?
leonard_hofstadter I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell.
howard_wolowitz Sounds like we’re in business.
raj_koothrappali I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Oh!
raj_koothrappali Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?
leonard_hofstadter I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord, shush.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?
penny Who, me?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I don’t think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
sheldon_cooper The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
leonard_hofstadter She’s not going to steal our idea.
penny What idea?
leonard_hofstadter We’re gonna write an application…
sheldon_cooper The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…
penny Okay, stop, stop!
sheldon_cooper Of Texas.
penny Whatever your secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, so I’m not interested.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…
penny Bored.
leonard_hofstadter Satisfied?
sheldon_cooper Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
penny Hey, wait a minute.
howard_wolowitz Well, hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
sheldon_cooper Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I…
penny Hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
sheldon_cooper She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.
leonard_hofstadter That is ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Oh, is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.
penny Oh, great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this.
howard_wolowitz There’s your answer, free food.
sheldon_cooper All right, I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.
raj_koothrappali Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
sheldon_cooper A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
sheldon_cooper Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.
howard_wolowitz Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
sheldon_cooper Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
sheldon_cooper You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
raj_koothrappali Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
sheldon_cooper All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed.
leonard_hofstadter So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
sheldon_cooper Good one, boss.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
sheldon_cooper In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.
leonard_hofstadter Are you done?
sheldon_cooper If you say so, boss.
howard_wolowitz So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…
sheldon_cooper How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
raj_koothrappali So it spells Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Does it? A happy accident.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not doing names now. Howard?
howard_wolowitz Like I was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
sheldon_cooper All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
leonard_hofstadter That’s just Sheldon backwards.
sheldon_cooper Another happy accident.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not wasting time with names right now.
sheldon_cooper I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
sheldon_cooper I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
leonard_hofstadter Oh Sheldon, stop it.
sheldon_cooper When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…
leonard_hofstadter That’s enough, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, that’s it, you’re fired.
sheldon_cooper Really? Why?
leonard_hofstadter Because you’re impossible to work with.
sheldon_cooper I see. And is that open for discussion?
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.
leonard_hofstadter But I fired you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I know. I’m now an independent contractor.
leonard_hofstadter No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
sheldon_cooper But I made it better.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
sheldon_cooper Well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell are bus pants?
sheldon_cooper They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends.
sheldon_cooper Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
raj_koothrappali Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?
howard_wolowitz It means after we play handball, I’m showering at home.
sheldon_cooper Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.
raj_koothrappali World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
sheldon_cooper Don’t thank me. You earned it.
howard_wolowitz Howard Wolowitz. Why not World’s Greatest Engineer?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.
howard_wolowitz We’re not quitting on Leonard.
sheldon_cooper I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
raj_koothrappali What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back.
howard_wolowitz Okay, let’s try this one. Spherical Hankel function.
leonard_hofstadter Hold on. That’s it!
howard_wolowitz Eureka!
raj_koothrappali Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.
howard_wolowitz Fine. Let’s say it together.
raj_koothrappali No. The moment has passed.
sheldon_cooper Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?
raj_koothrappali You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?
sheldon_cooper Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?
leonard_hofstadter We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?
howard_wolowitz No. It’s a little tricky. I’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?!
sheldon_cooper Playing the theremin.
leonard_hofstadter No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
sheldon_cooper Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon! We’re working here!
sheldon_cooper That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. Well, that was a little uncalled for.
leonard_hofstadter No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
sheldon_cooper So, your project is more important than mine?
leonard_hofstadter Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
sheldon_cooper Don’t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don’t want me here, just say the word, and I’ll leave.
sheldon_cooper Could have beaten around the bush a little.
sheldon_cooper Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.
penny What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
sheldon_cooper I’m practicing my theremin.
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.
penny Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
penny Oh, honey, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
penny Is that so?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And they’re still sticky.
penny Aw.
sheldon_cooper Probably going to have to throw them away.
penny Hey, you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
sheldon_cooper With you?
penny Seriously, I have a great idea for one.
sheldon_cooper Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
penny Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
sheldon_cooper That’s your app idea?
penny Well, you don’t like it?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t.
penny Why not?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.
penny And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.
sheldon_cooper I know, it’s baffling. Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.
penny Sheldon, I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
sheldon_cooper Do you make it with milk or water?
penny Milk.
sheldon_cooper Real cocoa?
penny That’s what it says on the packet.
sheldon_cooper Do you have those little marshmallows?
penny No, sorry.
sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose it’s appropriate.
penny What does that mean?
sheldon_cooper A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
raj_koothrappali Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.
leonard_hofstadter I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit.
raj_koothrappali What do you think we should sell it for?
howard_wolowitz Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I’d say about a million dollars a pop.
raj_koothrappali Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.
penny Hi. I’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your Sheldon back.
leonard_hofstadter What’s he doing in your apartment?
penny Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.
leonard_hofstadter Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.
penny Look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?
leonard_hofstadter We’re not playing. This is real work.
howard_wolowitz We’re going to be hundred-aires.
penny Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
leonard_hofstadter Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
penny Okay. Wait right here.
raj_koothrappali I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.
sheldon_cooper Really? Leonard wants me back?
penny Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.
sheldon_cooper Well, we sure saw that coming.
penny That’s right.
sheldon_cooper You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
penny No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
sheldon_cooper How?
penny Say you’re sorry.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars.
penny Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?
sheldon_cooper No.
penny No?
sheldon_cooper I was being sarcastic.
penny Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.
sheldon_cooper Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.
penny Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.
penny Oh, you’re welcome.
sheldon_cooper Boy, I’m getting good at this.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up.
sheldon_cooper Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
sheldon_cooper Well, I must say, I am impressed.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
sheldon_cooper You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
howard_wolowitz We have.
sheldon_cooper As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea.
penny Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
sheldon_cooper Bored.
penny Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
sheldon_cooper Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…
penny Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they’re so cute…
sheldon_cooper Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…
