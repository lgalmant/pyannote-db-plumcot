bernadette I like your suit.
penny Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.
howard How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?
leonard She doesn’t flirt with doctors.
penny Yeah. It’s all very professional.
amy You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?
penny Okay, good.
bernadette Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?
sheldon Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.
bernadette Oh. What’s going on?
sheldon I started doing it.
raj You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.
leonard Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.
raj You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.
penny Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?
sheldon Why not?
penny You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
sheldon Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
leonard I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.
bernadette Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
leonard Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
raj Yup.
sheldon I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.
leonard So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.
penny I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.
leonard Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…
penny Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.
leonard Hmm.
penny This is for you.
leonard Huh. What is this?
penny Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.
leonard The one I gave you?
penny Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?
leonard Uh, yeah.
penny What?
leonard Nothing.
penny Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.
leonard You’re right.
penny What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
leonard Doesn’t sound that bad.
penny Well, good, because that’s what I did.
leonard Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.
penny Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.
leonard You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.
penny Why?
leonard The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.
penny And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.
leonard Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.
penny Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.
leonard I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.
penny Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight.
leonard I don’t, either.
penny Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?
leonard Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.
raj Hey, Sheldon, you busy?
sheldon I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.
raj Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
sheldon Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?
raj So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.
sheldon Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.
raj It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
sheldon Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.
raj Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
sheldon Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
raj Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.
sheldon So it’s settled, we’re not doing it.
raj Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.
sheldon Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
raj Exactly.
sheldon Very well.
raj So where should we do it?
sheldon Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.
raj Uh, Sheldon…
sheldon Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos.
leonard Hey, you got a sec?
penny Hi. Sure.
leonard I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
penny Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
leonard No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.
penny Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.
leonard Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.
penny Mm.
leonard Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.
penny You know what, that’s great. I love that.
leonard Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.
penny You two want to be alone?
leonard I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.
penny Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that.
leonard What?
penny Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.
leonard Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
penny Control issues?
leonard Maybe.
penny Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.
leonard Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.
penny You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.
leonard Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?
penny Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.
raj Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
amy Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.
raj Did you get in?
amy No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
sheldon Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.
raj This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
sheldon Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked.
raj Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.
sheldon All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?
amy Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time.
raj We’re going to be fine.
amy Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this.
sheldon Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.
raj I’m sweating already.
sheldon Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.
raj How hot is it?
sheldon Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees.
raj Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
sheldon True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.
leonard Thanks again for having us.
howard Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?
penny Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.
bernadette I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.
howard I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings.
leonard Well, nailed it.
howard So what did you want to know?
penny Well, do you guys ever fight over money?
bernadette Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.
howard You didn’t have to say so much more.
bernadette Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.
howard I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.
bernadette Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?
howard For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.
bernadette Without asking me?
howard There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
bernadette How much, Howie?
howard Not a lot.
bernadette How much?
howard Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.
bernadette Was it more or less than falconry school?
howard For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.
leonard Like I would swing with him.
raj How you feeling?
sheldon Good. Little claustrophobic.
raj Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.
sheldon Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
raj Do you know any mining songs?
sheldon Just the hits. Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew.
rajj That’s pretty.
sheldon Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
raj It’s a little more bleak than I thought.
sheldon Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.
raj Getting kind of grim.
sheldon Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.
raj Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
sheldon Who’s he?
howard Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
bernadette Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here.
howard Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.
leonard She made him a chore chart.
penny I see it.
howard Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.
bernadette That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
howard That pan had to soak and you know it.
bernadette Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance.
howard It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.
leonard I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.
raj So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.
sheldon That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
raj But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
sheldon He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
amy You guys doing okay down there?
sheldon I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
amy You guys doing okay down there?
sheldon Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
amy I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
sheldon This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
amy Okay, just checking.
raj We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
sheldon You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.
raj What if we brought them down with us?
sheldon We’ll take some Funyuns.
amy Anything else?
sheldon Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.
rajj Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.
bernadette Sorry you guys had to see that.
penny Oh, don’t apologize.
leonard Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
bernadette Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.
penny It really bothers him?
bernadette Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him.
penny Uh-oh.
leonard What?
penny Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.
leonard Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like.
bernadette I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go check on him.
penny Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.
leonard Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
penny It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
howard Why are you being so bossy?
bernadette Why are you being a baby?
howard I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?
leonard Should we go?
penny Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
raj Oh, this heat is brutal.
sheldon As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.
rajj Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
sheldon My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
raj How’s that going?
sheldon You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
raj Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
sheldon We’re not stopping.
raj You don’t have to bite my head off.
sheldon I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle.
raj If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable.
sheldon My struggle is emotional.
raj Oh. Is it Amy?
sheldon It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening.
raj Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.
sheldon Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
raj The space probe.
sheldon Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
raj By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.
amy Sheldon, is everything okay?
sheldon It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.
amy 11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought.
raj They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt.
penny Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.
leonard I’ve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It’s my first time, too.
bernadette I’m so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.
howard It’s okay.
bernadette No, it’s not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.
howard I want that, too.
bernadette Now, let’s talk about your birthday party.
howard Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
bernadette Oh.
amy Do you really need me to transcribe this?
sheldon You’re not doing it for me. You’re doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.
raj You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You’re a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.
sheldon His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
