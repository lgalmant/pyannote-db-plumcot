leonard All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
sheldon That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
leonard So what’s going on with you two?
sheldon Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.
leonard Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?
sheldon Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.
leonard Got it.
sheldon I sense judgment on your part.
leonard No, no. Maybe a little.
sheldon May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
leonard Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
sheldon I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
leonard Oh, right. That.
sheldon Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.
leonard I’m not jealous.
sheldon Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
sheldon You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist.
leonard Probably. What’s your point?
sheldon No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
leonard Hmm, recently? Not much.
sheldon Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?
leonard Um, shut up.
sheldon You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.
leonard That sounds lovely.
sheldon It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?
leonard Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre.
sheldon Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.
leonard Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.
sheldon It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.We never put Meemaw in a home!
leonard Hey, guys.
howard Hey.
raj Hey.
sheldon All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!
howard Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.
raj When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.
leonard You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t.
rai You mean, you don’t.
leonard You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
raj Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk, because she can’t hear me.
leonard What?
raj That’s what she said.
leonard Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…
sheldon No, no, no, no!
leonard …who’s a friend.
sheldon Thank you.
leonard What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?
stuart Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.
leonard Oh. Well, good for you.
stuart Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?
leonard Why don’t you just break up with her?
stuart No, no, I can’t.
leonard Why not?
stuart ‘Cause then I’d be alone, like you.
raj Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
leonard Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
raj Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.
leonard You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
raj Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
sheldon Leonard? Are you sleeping?
leonard No.
sheldon Are you ill?
leonard No.
sheldon Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?
leonard I don’t know. Maybe.
sheldon I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
amy May I offer an observation?
leonard What the hell? How long has she been here?
sheldon Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
leonard That was two hours ago.
sheldon As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy.
amy From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.
sheldon Did you know that, Leonard?
leonard No.
sheldon I did.
amy I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
leonard No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
sheldon Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?
leonard Right.
amy That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.
sheldon Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?
leonard Keep going. I’m listening.
amy That was rude.
sheldon He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
amy Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
sheldon Let’s make that our word of the day.
amy Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
sheldon Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.
amy Wait. I have a request.
sheldon Yes?
amy I’d like you to meet my mother.
sheldon I see. Can I get back to you on that?
amy Certainly. Good night.
sheldon Good night. Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
leonard Yeah, what?
sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
leonard Yeah. So?
sheldon What does that mean?
leonard Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?
sheldon Uh-huh.
leonard You can’t say that anymore.
sheldon Wait. What?
leonard Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
sheldon I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
leonard Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?
sheldon Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.
leonard That is insane.
sheldon You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
leonard Okay, good luck.
sheldon Wait! What am I supposed to do?
leonard Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?
sheldon Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie.
leonard All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
sheldon Screwed.
leonard There you go.
sheldon Amy’s right. He is tedious.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, get the door!
howard Why can’t you get it?
mrs_wolowitz You know I’m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I’m like an upside-down volcano here.
howard Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that.
leonard The volcano thing? No.
howard What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
leonard No, it’s just something I threw on.
howard I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?
leonard Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts.
howard So, how’d it go?
leonard It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.
howard Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.
leonard I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.
howard You that desperate?
leonard No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.
mrs_wolowitz Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?
leonard To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.
howard Yeah, I know what you mean.
leonard Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?
sheldon As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
leonard What are you working on?
sheldon I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
leonard Ah, you’re going off the grid.
sheldon Exactly.
leonard The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
sheldon Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
leonard What if she just comes over?
sheldon She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
leonard You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
sheldon Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.
leonard Who is it?
amy Amy Farrah Fowler.
sheldon Darn! She found me!
leonard She’s been here before.
sheldon The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.
leonard What do you want to do?
sheldon Tell her I’m not here.
leonard Okay, where are you?
sheldon I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.
leonard Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here.
amy All right.
sheldon Way to go on the details.
leonard Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.
bernadette Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.
howard Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
bernadette We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.
girl Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.
bernadette Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.
leonard Hi.
joy Hi. You don’t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.
leonard Uh…
joy Aah! Time’s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I’m hilarious.
leonard Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?
joy Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off.
leonard Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
joy Number 42!
leonard Whoa!
bernadette Isn’t she a pip?
sheldon Proxima Centauri’s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard’s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that’s wrong! EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.
joy This lobster’s good on the way down and the way up.
leonard Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound.
joy Hey, this is a date, right?
leonard Yep, it is.
joy 73!
leonard Whoa!
joy Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls’ room and take a wicked whiz.
bernadette I’ll go with you.
joy Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.
howard I think she likes you.
sheldon EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.
amy Sheldon?
sheldon Rats!
amy I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
sheldon No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.
amy In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that I’m in a relationship.
sheldon So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
amy Precisely.
sheldon And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
amy Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.
amy I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
sheldon Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
amy Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me.
sheldon My apologies. Good night, Amy.
amy Good night, Sheldon.
howard Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you.
leonard Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.
howard Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten.
leonard I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.
howard Not that I’ve ever seen.
leonard It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
joy Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.
leonard Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…
joy Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin’s wedding.
leonard You’re asking me out?
joy Yeah. And it’s an open bar, so I’ll probably be giving it away.
leonard I look forward to it.
mrs_fowler It’s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn’t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.
sheldon I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
mrs_fowler What?
sheldon Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.
mrs_fowler Amy, what is he saying?
amy You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.
sheldon Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina.
mrs_fowler Oh!
amy Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.
sheldon Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
