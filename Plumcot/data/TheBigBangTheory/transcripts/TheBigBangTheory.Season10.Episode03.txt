howard_wolowitz It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.
sheldon_cooper Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts.
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all.
howard_wolowitz Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere.
leonard_hofstadter We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
sheldon_cooper I know, I was there.
howard_wolowitz Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights.
sheldon_cooper How late?
howard_wolowitz Well, I don’t know, midnight, one.
sheldon_cooper One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.
howard_wolowitz If you’re tired, have some coffee.
sheldon_cooper What? You have some coffee.
howard_wolowitz I am having coffee.
sheldon_cooper And look how irritable it’s making you!
leonard_hofstadter Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try
sheldon_cooper Fine. I don’t think I can go much longer.
leonard_hofstadter It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up.
sheldon_cooper I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.
penny Good morning.
leonard_hofstadter What is this?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that is so nice.
sheldon_cooper Ow, it does hurt.
leonard_hofstadter So, what are you guys gonna do today?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that was never happening.
penny Oh, I’ll go. I like a party.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.
penny It’s okay, I’ll still go.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t think you’ll be bored?
penny Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?
sheldon_cooper I won’t be there.
leonard_hofstadter Look at that, it is a party.
howard_wolowitz Sorry I have to work all weekend.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay.
howard_wolowitz Thanks again for breakfast.
raj_koothrappali Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.
bernadette_rostenkowski You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
raj_koothrappali So, what should we do today?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me.
raj_koothrappali Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not really.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.
bernadette_rostenkowski I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?
bernadette_rostenkowski Isn’t it a little early for that?
raj_koothrappali You have to get to it eventually.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing.
raj_koothrappali How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think you are.
raj_koothrappali You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 Psst, hey, kid.
sheldon_cooper Huh, what?
the_flash You look tired. Why don’t you have an energy drink? Everyone’s doing it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.
the_flash Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.
sheldon_cooper I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.
the_flash All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.
sheldon_cooper Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
the_flash You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.
sheldon_cooper I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
the_flash Here. It’s on the house.
sheldon_cooper The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?
the_flash You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.
penny Hi.
bert_kibbler Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke.
amy_farrah_fowler Bert’s a geologist.
bert_kibbler And a joker.
penny How early are we?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, actually, we’re an hour late.
penny I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t even know where to begin.
raj_koothrappali Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here.
raj_koothrappali Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?
bernadette_rostenkowski My dad built it for me.
raj_koothrappali Wow, it’s so cute.
bernadette_rostenkowski This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.
raj_koothrappali Oh, and did they have kids?
bernadette_rostenkowski They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
raj_koothrappali I skipped spin class for this.
howard_wolowitz Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.
leonard_hofstadter Are you okay?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.
howard_wolowitz You wanted him awake.
penny So should we talk to each other or mingle?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know where everyone is.
penny Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.
bert_kibbler Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.
penny Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
bert_kibbler Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing.
penny Wait, what do you mean she’s her?
bert_kibbler Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?
penny No.
amy_farrah_fowler No.
bert_kibbler Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.
penny What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon.
bert_kibbler Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you.
penny Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?
howard_wolowitz Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
leonard_hofstadter According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two.
sheldon_cooper My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t you just go home?
sheldon_cooper No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I want another one.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.
leonard_hofstadter You only had one.
sheldon_cooper No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.
howard_wolowitz You can’t develop a problem that fast.
sheldon_cooper You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling.
leonard_hofstadter We can’t afford to lose any more time.
howard_wolowitz Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?
leonard_hofstadter That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Yes, of course.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.
howard_wolowitz No worries.
sheldon_cooper You guys stink.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.
raj_koothrappali I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
bernadette_rostenkowski Does it really need one?
raj_koothrappali Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you just gonna name all the colours?
raj_koothrappali Well, not now.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t care what colour the room is.
raj_koothrappali Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you’re not, so just drop it. I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?
raj_koothrappali Sorry. Sorry.
bert_kibbler And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.
penny You trend setter.
amy_farrah_fowler Just the right idea at the right time.
penny Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard.
bert_kibbler Who?
penny Leonard Hofstadter.
bert_kibbler Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.
penny That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down.
bert_kibbler It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.
amy_farrah_fowler And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
penny You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart.
penny Wow, you popular girls are mean.
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?
sheldon_cooper Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem.
sheldon_cooper I do.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but I do.
leonard_hofstadter No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?
sheldon_cooper With what?
leonard_hofstadter Your problem.
sheldon_cooper I thought I didn’t have a problem.
howard_wolowitz That was painful to watch.
raj_koothrappali So where are we going?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know.
raj_koothrappali Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, why don’t I care about anything?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?
raj_koothrappali Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.
bernadette_rostenkowski I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?
raj_koothrappali Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.
bernadette_rostenkowski Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.
raj_koothrappali Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, can I ask you a question?
leonard_hofstadter Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
sheldon_cooper Howard, can I ask you a question?
howard_wolowitz No.
sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care.
sheldon_cooper You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
sheldon_cooper I can’t.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you can.
sheldon_cooper No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously?
sheldon_cooper I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.
leonard_hofstadter It’s okay, we’ll figure something out.
sheldon_cooper But what if we can’t?
leonard_hofstadter It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy?
howard_wolowitz When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.
bert_kibbler My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?
amy_farrah_fowler I think we’re good.
bert_kibbler Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people.
penny Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.
bert_kibbler You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.
penny Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Bye.
raj_koothrappali Uh, pull over.
bernadette_rostenkowski What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you.
raj_koothrappali Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.
dr_vm_koothrappali Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?
raj_koothrappali What? No.
dr_vm_koothrappali Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?
raj_koothrappali No.
dr_vm_koothrappali Great. What’s up?
raj_koothrappali This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
dr_vm_koothrappali Of course. What seems to be the trouble?
bernadette_rostenkowski Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies.
dr_vm_koothrappali Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby.
bernadette_rostenkowski But I thought I’d be more excited.
dr_vm_koothrappali Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you. I feel better now.
raj_koothrappali Well I don’t.
dr_vm_koothrappali Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.
leonard_hofstadter Um, I don’t really know how to say this.
colonel_richard_williams Well, you could try starting with sir.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Sorry, sir.
sheldon_cooper He said start with it, not end with it.
leonard_hofstadter Sir.
colonel_richard_williams Hmm?
howard_wolowitz We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.
sheldon_cooper The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
leonard_hofstadter I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.
colonel_richard_williams How long do you need?
howard_wolowitz We, we’re thinking, two years.
colonel_richard_williams All right.
howard_wolowitz That’s it? You’re okay with that?
colonel_richard_williams What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks for understanding, sir.
howard_wolowitz Yes, thank you so much.
sheldon_cooper We, we really appreciate it.
leonard_hofstadter All right, pressure’s off
howard_wolowitz Wanna see a movie?
sheldon_cooper Popcorn’s on me.
