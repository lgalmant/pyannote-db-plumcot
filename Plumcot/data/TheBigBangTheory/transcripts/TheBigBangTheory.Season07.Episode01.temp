leonard Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?
sheldon Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important.
leonard What is it?
sheldon Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.
leonard So?
sheldon So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?
leonard Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here.
sheldon You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?
leonard What was what?
sheldon This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.
leonard Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k…
sheldon No!
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s the matter?
sheldon Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.
penny Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
sheldon To be honest, I did.
penny Aw.
sheldon Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
penny Good night.
sheldon No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.
penny You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
sheldon You’re welcome. Good night.
raj I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all.
howard I’m proud of you.
raj Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.
sheldon Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.
raj Is that true?
sheldon Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.
howard Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new.
raj How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.
howard Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.
raj You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
howard Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.
raj You would do that for me?
howard Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.
raj Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?
sheldon I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.
bernadette Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.
amy Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.
bernadette The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.
amy Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.
bernadette Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.
amy Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.
sheldon Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…
penny No.
sheldon Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.
penny Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
sheldon You overestimate his significance in my life.
penny Mmm.
sheldon Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?
penny Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.
sheldon Well, I try.
penny All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.
sheldon Great. I’ll go first.
penny Okay.
sheldon By the way, how are you with zippers?
penny Why?
sheldon Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.
raj Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.
girl It is. You can download my paper off the university server.
raj I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
girl I will.
raj All right.
howard How’d it go?
raj Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.
howard Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
raj Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.
howard I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.
raj That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.
mrs_davis Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.
howard Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.
raj You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.
mrs_davis Okay.
raj So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.
howard It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.
bernadette I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
amy Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag.
bernadette To the advancement of science.
amy And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
bernadette This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.
amy Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.
waiter From the two gentlemen at the bar.
amy Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
bernadette Be cool.
amy You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.
bernadette You’re right. Thank you.
sheldon Ooh. Bad move.
penny Really? Why?
sheldon My queen can now take your rook from below.
penny So that means I lose, right? It’s over?
sheldon If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.
penny Okay, let’s take a break.
sheldon We’re all out of alcohol.
penny I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.
sheldon Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.
penny I’m calling him.
sheldon Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.
leonard Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?
penny Leonard?
leonard Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.
everybody Hi, Penny!
penny Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.
leonard Best time of my life.
sheldon Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
leonard Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!
penny Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.
random_voice Iceberg!
leonard Uh-oh, hang on.
sheldon Are you in danger?
leonard No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!
everybody Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!
penny Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
sheldon You were.
amy So what happened? How’d it go?
bernadette It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
amy So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
bernadette Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.
amy And why would no one blame me?
bernadette I don’t know what I’m saying.
amy Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.
bernadette Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.
amy No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.
bernadette I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.
amy And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?
bernadette Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?
amy We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.
bernadette Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?
amy Sure.
bernadette Thanks.
amy Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
penny I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
sheldon That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
penny No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
sheldon Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.
penny Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?
sheldon Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?
penny No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.
sheldon Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.
penny This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?
sheldon Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?
penny Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.
sheldon Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.
penny He did?
sheldon Yes.
penny Oh, that’s really sweet.
sheldon Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.
penny Well, now I miss him even more.
sheldon Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.
penny Thanks.
sheldon Oh, seriously?
raj Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?
mrs_davis What?
raj I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.
mrs_davis Forget about it.
raj You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.
mrs_davis Is that right?
raj Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.
sheldon Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
penny Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
sheldon Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.
penny How about we just talk?
sheldon All right. In 4D chess…
penny No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.
sheldon I own nine pairs of pants.
penny Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.
sheldon I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
penny How about I go first?
sheldon But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.
penny Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.
sheldon I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
penny Oh, God.
sheldon And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.
penny Okay.
sheldon Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.
penny That’s your big revelation?
sheldon Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.
penny Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.
sheldon Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
penny What did I do?
sheldon I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.
penny I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.
sheldon It is to me; that’s the point.
penny Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.
sheldon Your apology is accepted.
penny Thank you. How about a hug?
sheldon How about a hearty handshake?
penny Come on.
sheldon Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
bernadette Good night.
amy Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
bernadette Yeah, that felt nice.
amy Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
bernadette So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?
amy I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
bernadette Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.
amy Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.
bernadette Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
amy Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
both Good night.
mrs_davis All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.
raj Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.
mrs_davis Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.
raj Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.
mrs_davis Are you hitting on me?
raj No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.
mrs_davis You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
raj Good night.
howard Looks like she accepted your apology.
raj And then some. I think we had a moment.
howard Oh, please, you did not have a moment.
raj Who died and made you king of moments?
howard Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.
raj There was.
howard There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?
raj I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
howard So nothing.
raj No, not a thing.
penny Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.
leonard That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
everyone Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!
penny Aaaaaaah!
