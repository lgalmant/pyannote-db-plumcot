howard_wolowitz Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Here comes another contraction.
stuart_bloom Let’s pick it up.
raj_koothrappali All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.
howard_wolowitz Stop that, this isn’t India.
raj_koothrappali Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
howard_wolowitz Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
raj_koothrappali I love you, too. We’re good.
sheldon_cooper Amy? Wake up.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper It’s midnight. Happy birthday.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.
sheldon_cooper This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
sheldon_cooper A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.
amy_farrah_fowler I love it. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.
amy_farrah_fowler Is that okay?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.
amy_farrah_fowler You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.
penny Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, we’re going to the hospital.
amy_farrah_fowler I guess, I guess we should stop.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?
howard_wolowitz I’m the father.
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?
howard_wolowitz No idea. Ask him.
raj_koothrappali 12 minutes.
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 12 minutes? Why are you here?
stuart_bloom Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 This is a hospital, not the airport.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry. It’s our first time.
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?
howard_wolowitz No, we’re keeping it a surprise.
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 Old school. Nice.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not that old school. He knows.
raj_koothrappali You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.
howard_wolowitz And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?
midwife#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.
penny Sheldon, what took you so long?
sheldon_cooper Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
leonard_hofstadter Damn, I need my inhaler.
amy_farrah_fowler Just don’t smoke.
leonard_hofstadter No, I went down the stairs too fast.
penny Hey.
raj_koothrappali Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
penny Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?
bernadette_rostenkowski We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.
penny Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, first deliveries can be slow.
sheldon_cooper I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
leonard_hofstadter I found it, but it’s empty.
penny Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure? I’d really like to.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, should we, uh, head back up?
penny Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?
sheldon_cooper It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide.
penny Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh.
penny We could go to a bar.
amy_farrah_fowler Well.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.
penny Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
sheldon_cooper That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?
penny I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
sheldon_cooper Grape. I find it the most mild.
penny All right, well, you two go have fun.
leonard_hofstadter If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.
penny Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you really need to record this?
raj_koothrappali You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t.
howard_wolowitz All right, enough with the camera.
raj_koothrappali Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?
raj_koothrappali I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!
stuart_bloom You’re doing great.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj.
raj_koothrappali Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
bernadette_rostenkowski How could you?
howard_wolowitz We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it.
raj_koothrappali Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.
stuart_bloom You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj.
raj_koothrappali You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.
amy_farrah_fowler So, where were we?
sheldon_cooper Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, shall we start over?
sheldon_cooper Very well.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them.
amy_farrah_fowler And the mood continues to change.
sheldon_cooper No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this.
amy_farrah_fowler Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
sheldon_cooper Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not about trains.
sheldon_cooper Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
amy_farrah_fowler Stop talking about trains.
sheldon_cooper Who’s killing the mood now?
leonard_hofstadter Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?
penny Well, I didn’t until I heard that.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.
raj_koothrappali Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.
penny Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away.
raj_koothrappali You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
sheldon_cooper Can I look yet?
amy_farrah_fowler One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter.
sheldon_cooper Wowza.
amy_farrah_fowler I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
sheldon_cooper What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.
amy_farrah_fowler I did. Am I in trouble?
sheldon_cooper Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.
amy_farrah_fowler Wait, what just happened?
sheldon_cooper You know I’ve been wanting to go.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Is this about the baby?
raj_koothrappali No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
amy_farrah_fowler Good. Then you’re used to this.
penny Hey, Bernadette’s water broke.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, everyone to the hospital.
amy_farrah_fowler You have got to be kidding me.
howard_wolowitz Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.
stuart_bloom I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right.
stuart_bloom All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out.
penny Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
raj_koothrappali This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it is their child.
raj_koothrappali I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.
sheldon_cooper Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
raj_koothrappali And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
amy_farrah_fowler I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?
sheldon_cooper She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.
howard_wolowitz Deep breaths, slow breaths.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
stuart_bloom Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more.
howard_wolowitz Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back.
stuart_bloom Okay.
howard_wolowitz So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.
bernadette_rostenkowski We could name her after your mom.
howard_wolowitz Debbie? No. She hated that name.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did she have a middle name?
howard_wolowitz Melvina.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s keep thinking.
howard_wolowitz Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know.
howard_wolowitz Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.
bernadette_rostenkowski She did always have candy in her pocket.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.
bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?
howard_wolowitz Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today.
leonard_hofstadter It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie.
penny How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come.
stuart_bloom Hmm. You two got married.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon and I are living together.
sheldon_cooper But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.
leonard_hofstadter Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep.
penny Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.
stuart_bloom Howard went to space.
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette got her doctorate.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.
amy_farrah_fowler We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.
raj_koothrappali For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you.
stuart_bloom What’s your problem?
raj_koothrappali Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.
sheldon_cooper I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.
stuart_bloom Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
sheldon_cooper Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class.
bernadette_rostenkowski I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.
howard_wolowitz Do you want me to get the nurse?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
stuart_bloom Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?
penny You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.
raj_koothrappali Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move.
penny Anyone else want to try?
stuart_bloom Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?
penny Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.
raj_koothrappali I bought the first one, it didn’t fall.
penny Here.
howard_wolowitz She’s here, the baby’s here.
penny Oh!
raj_koothrappali Congratulations.
amy_farrah_fowler How’s Bernadette?
howard_wolowitz Tired, but great. They’re both great.
penny Does the baby have a name yet?
howard_wolowitz We have named her Halley.
penny – Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, like Halley’s comet.
howard_wolowitz Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking.
howard_wolowitz I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.
raj_koothrappali Really?
howard_wolowitz Of course.
raj_koothrappali You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.
penny Oh, look at all the babies.
sheldon_cooper Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about.
amy_farrah_fowler Kind of hard to see the names.
penny Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.
amy_farrah_fowler They all look the same to me.
raj_koothrappali Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that was quite a day.
sheldon_cooper It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.
amy_farrah_fowler I was afraid you’d be too tired.
sheldon_cooper Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is.
