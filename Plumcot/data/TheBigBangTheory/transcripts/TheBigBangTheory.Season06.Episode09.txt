leonard_hofstadter They are not.
raj_koothrappali They are, too.
leonard_hofstadter Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
raj_koothrappali No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
raj_koothrappali That’s called a fashion choice.
leonard_hofstadter All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.
sheldon_cooper If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.
leonard_hofstadter Good boy. Here’s a cookie.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you.
howard_wolowitz Hey, fellas, what’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, mummies and zombies again.
howard_wolowitz Oh, they’re not the same thing.
leonard_hofstadter You get a cookie, too.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
raj_koothrappali Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
howard_wolowitz Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, 294?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
sheldon_cooper That’s my parking spot.
raj_koothrappali Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.
sheldon_cooper It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll give you another parking space.
sheldon_cooper I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
howard_wolowitz Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.
sheldon_cooper Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
howard_wolowitz Are you listening to yourself?
sheldon_cooper I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.
howard_wolowitz Nope.
sheldon_cooper Very well. You leave me no choice.
sheldon_cooper What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?
sheldon_cooper President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.
sheldon_cooper No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.
leonard_hofstadter All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?
leonard_hofstadter Because I can never understand your side.
howard_wolowitz Give it back.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?
howard_wolowitz My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.
sheldon_cooper I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , I’m using it.
howard_wolowitz Fine. I’m taking your diploma.
sheldon_cooper Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.
bernadette_rostenkowski We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.
penny Yeah. So, how you doing?
amy_farrah_fowler A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?
penny Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.
amy_farrah_fowler I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Only five?
penny Hey, anybody want a drink?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?
amy_farrah_fowler For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
amy_farrah_fowler I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.
penny I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.
amy_farrah_fowler I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s that supposed to mean?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.
amy_farrah_fowler If and when?
penny Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
penny You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.
bernadette_rostenkowski Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?
penny Damn.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
penny Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Cookie.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t have any.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not giving it away.
howard_wolowitz Hi Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, what are you doing?
howard_wolowitz He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
sheldon_cooper Get off there.
howard_wolowitz Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
sheldon_cooper Give me back my parking space.
howard_wolowitz You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.
sheldon_cooper You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.
howard_wolowitz Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.
raj_koothrappali I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.
leonard_hofstadter Mmm.
amy_farrah_fowler This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
sheldon_cooper Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
amy_farrah_fowler Freaking pigs.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.
amy_farrah_fowler Wait, I’m leaving my car here?
sheldon_cooper Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.
amy_farrah_fowler Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.
sheldon_cooper All right, colour me intrigued.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you think?
sheldon_cooper I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.
penny Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.
bernadette_rostenkowski What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?
penny No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake. Oh, I’ll get it.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s not here. What’s wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, no. Where was it parked?
amy_farrah_fowler In Sheldon’s spot.
bernadette_rostenkowski That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, that doesn’t make sense, either.
amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because I’m the one who had it towed.
amy_farrah_fowler You?
bernadette_rostenkowski Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming.
penny Ow! Ow!
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my God,
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you okay?!
penny You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!
amy_farrah_fowler Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve been meaning to take to the bank.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you okay?
penny Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
bernadette_rostenkowski Here.
penny Thanks. Ah!
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?
penny Gee, you think?
amy_farrah_fowler I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.
bernadette_rostenkowski You hit her! What did I do?
amy_farrah_fowler You had my car towed.
bernadette_rostenkowski You were parked in Howard’s spot.
amy_farrah_fowler I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.
penny Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
bernadette_rostenkowski The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.
amy_farrah_fowler How do you know?
bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause I did it!
sheldon_cooper Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.
howard_wolowitz What the hell are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, you need to move now.
sheldon_cooper No, I don’t.
howard_wolowitz You can’t stay there forever.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to…
howard_wolowitz Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?
howard_wolowitz I’m warning you, Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. Stop that.
howard_wolowitz Get out of my spot.
sheldon_cooper No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
leonard_hofstadter What are you idiots doing?
sheldon_cooper He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.
howard_wolowitz Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
leonard_hofstadter You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.
howard_wolowitz It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.
sheldon_cooper Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.
howard_wolowitz Can you believe this guy?
leonard_hofstadter What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
howard_wolowitz Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate me just because I lived the dream.
sheldon_cooper Hey, sweet ride.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing in there?
sheldon_cooper Just breaking in your new car.
howard_wolowitz Stop that. You stop that.
sheldon_cooper You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
raj_koothrappali Hey, got a minute?
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course, come in. This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.
raj_koothrappali Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
howard_wolowitz All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…
raj_koothrappali Howard, that’s not how we practiced it.
howard_wolowitz I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure across the street.
sheldon_cooper Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.
howard_wolowitz Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say.
sheldon_cooper There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.
raj_koothrappali Just say it.
howard_wolowitz You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.
howard_wolowitz I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.
sheldon_cooper To burying the hatchet.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.
amy_farrah_fowler Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.
penny Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.
shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Can I help you?
sheldon_cooper Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.
shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 A what?
sheldon_cooper A naked man sat on it. Now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Lipid what?
sheldon_cooper Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.
shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Tuesday okay?
sheldon_cooper Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Let me write you a ticket.
sheldon_cooper Is that your son?
shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis.
