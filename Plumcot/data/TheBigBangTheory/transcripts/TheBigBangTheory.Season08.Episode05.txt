raj_koothrappali Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.
leonard_hofstadter We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
howard_wolowitz Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.
sheldon_cooper I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not what happened.
sheldon_cooper I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.
howard_wolowitz No one wants to hear it.
sheldon_cooper Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.
leonard_hofstadter Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?
raj_koothrappali Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
howard_wolowitz Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
raj_koothrappali Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
howard_wolowitz And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.
leonard_hofstadter I think someone owes me an apology.
sheldon_cooper Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.
howard_wolowitz You admit Amy’s a distraction?
sheldon_cooper Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?
leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe we have lost our focus.
howard_wolowitz It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.
leonard_hofstadter Like our own science retreat.
howard_wolowitz My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
sheldon_cooper I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
leonard_hofstadter Then we’ll go to a hotel.
sheldon_cooper A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
raj_koothrappali We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
sheldon_cooper Did you see The Lake House?
raj_koothrappali Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.
sheldon_cooper Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house.
leonard_hofstadter You would go to a beach house?
sheldon_cooper Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.
penny Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I do.
penny Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hell, yeah.
penny Yes. I’ll check flights.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll check hotels.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.
leonard_hofstadter They seem okay with it.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.
raj_koothrappali Why not?
howard_wolowitz Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.
raj_koothrappali For your information, Emily is working tonight.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.
sheldon_cooper Thinking caps on.
howard_wolowitz Here we go.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.
howard_wolowitz Oh. I never saw that.
sheldon_cooper Really?
raj_koothrappali Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.
raj_koothrappali Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Is that a no?
howard_wolowitz Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?
leonard_hofstadter I, I think I still have it.
sheldon_cooper I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.
howard_wolowitz Mm, that was mine.
leonard_hofstadter Robot prostitute.
howard_wolowitz Also mine.
sheldon_cooper Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
howard_wolowitz There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.
howard_wolowitz No, it vibrates. Keep going.
leonard_hofstadter You know, let’s just come up with something new.
sheldon_cooper You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.
raj_koothrappali Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.
leonard_hofstadter How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
sheldon_cooper If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I have an idea.
sheldon_cooper I think I have the same one.
howard_wolowitz We got to watch Back to the Future II.
raj_koothrappali I’ll make the popcorn.
penny So, where should we go first?
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.
penny Nah.
amy_farrah_fowler But they play Barry Manilow.
penny No.
amy_farrah_fowler But they’re called Fairly Manilow.
penny Oh. Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Great.
penny No.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, what do you want to do?
penny Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.
amy_farrah_fowler What if we don’t want to vomit?
penny Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
penny It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
amy_farrah_fowler What does that mean?
penny It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.
bernadette_rostenkowski That sucks.
amy_farrah_fowler Can you start in the morning?
penny Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.
bernadette_rostenkowski You sure?
penny Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.
amy_farrah_fowler So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…
bernadette_rostenkowski We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
howard_wolowitz Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.
professor_in_cafeteria This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
sheldon_cooper Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
leonard_hofstadter Had will have placed?
sheldon_cooper That’s my boy.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…
leonard_hofstadter Wait. Is brought right?
sheldon_cooper Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. You did it to me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.
raj_koothrappali He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.
leonard_hofstadter Guys.
sheldon_cooper Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?
raj_koothrappali Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
leonard_hofstadter Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think it worked.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think after this, I’ll be dead.
amy_farrah_fowler Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.
amy_farrah_fowler It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good.
bernadette_rostenkowski We are.
amy_farrah_fowler Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re embarrassing me.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.
leonard_hofstadter All right.
sheldon_cooper Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.
raj_koothrappali Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.
leonard_hofstadter So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.
howard_wolowitz Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.
sheldon_cooper Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.
raj_koothrappali Go online and look it up.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.
raj_koothrappali That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?
howard_wolowitz Like behavior modification?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?
raj_koothrappali That cannot be true.
raj_koothrappali Hey, it was match point.
leonard_hofstadter Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
raj_koothrappali Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
howard_wolowitz We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
sheldon_cooper Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.
leonard_hofstadter If only we had one.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’ll check Amazon.
bernadette_rostenkowski Housekeeping.
amy_farrah_fowler We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
bernadette_rostenkowski It was us the whole time.
amy_farrah_fowler Why’d you tell her? It was working.
bernadette_rostenkowski Was it working?
penny Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I’m so sorry.
penny You guys look like you’re having fun.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re having the best time.
bernadette_rostenkowski Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
penny That’s a dollar.
bernadette_rostenkowski Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.
bernadette_rostenkowski We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
penny That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
amy_farrah_fowler Can you believe this nerd?
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on.
