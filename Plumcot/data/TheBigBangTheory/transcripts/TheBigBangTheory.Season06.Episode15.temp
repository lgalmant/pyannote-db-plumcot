leonard I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
sheldon That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either.
leonard Why would you say that?
sheldon You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.
leonard That was a huge spoiler.
sheldon Good.
leonard What is wrong with you? If I did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks.
sheldon Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
leonard Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
sheldon Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.
leonard You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating.
sheldon There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving my point, little lady.
leonard You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
sheldon What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. You’re impossible.
leonard That’s it. I don’t, I don’t have to put up with this.
sheldon Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.
leonard Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.
sheldon You pick that up right now.
leonard No.
sheldon Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.
leonard I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.
sheldon Where are you going?
leonard To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.
sheldon Crazy bastard?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Leonard, wait.
leonard What?
sheldon Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
raj Here you go.
howard Great. Come on in.
raj What, you don’t say thank you?
howard It’s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.
raj Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?
howard No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It’s part of a bonus she got.
raj Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
howard Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
raj Is there a good anal leakage?
howard Anyway, it was Bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.
raj Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.
howard Hey, I got a favour to ask.
raj Sure.
howard My mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
raj Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.
howard She’s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay.
raj Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
howard Really? What do you got going on?
raj I don’t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.
howard Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.
howard I told her around seven.
leonard I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.
penny Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
leonard Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live with him for one more minute.
penny Wow. Where are you going to go?
leonard I was thinking here with you.
penny Oh.
leonard That a problem?
penny No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.
leonard He’s got Amy now.
penny Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.
leonard Why?
penny Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?
leonard Harry and Ginny get together?
penny Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.
leonard Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.
penny Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.
leonard Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
penny No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really big step.
leonard Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?
penny Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.
leonard Yeah.
penny I got nothing.
leonard Great. I’ll go get my stuff.
penny Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work.
leonard Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.
penny Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.
mrs_wolowitz Are you ready for dessert?
raj No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.
mrs_wolowitz Oh, please. You’re a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.
raj Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
mrs_wolowitz The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?
raj That would be lovely. Thank you. Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?
mrs_wolowitz Don’t mind me. I just cry when I’m lonely and have nothing to live for.
raj I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
mrs_wolowitz Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?
raj Sure.
mrs_wolowitz I’ll make one.
sheldon One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s Leonard’s.
amy Children’s toy.
amy Children’s toy.
sheldon One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it.
amy So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?
sheldon Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?
amy No.
sheldon Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.
amy Like a dog-boy.
sheldon Exactly.
amy What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
sheldon That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.
amy Great. Here I am!
sheldon Wait. Here who is where?
amy Me. Aren’t I your perfect roommate?
sheldon Um…
amy Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?
sheldon Um…
amy Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
sheldon Um…
amy See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
sheldon Um…
sheldon Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard.
leonard What do you want?
sheldon Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
leonard Is that so?
sheldon Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
leonard Cut to the chase, Sheldon.
sheldon Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of product.
penny Hey. What’s going on?
leonard Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.
penny Really? Interesting.
leonard Well, too late, pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?
penny It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
sheldon Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for.
penny Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine.
leonard Well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.
penny Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
sheldon Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn’t refute.
penny That is the worst, isn’t it?
sheldon Yes.
leonard I’m sorry, Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face.
amy Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?
sheldon Um…
raj Hello?
howard Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?
raj Okay, I guess.
howard What time did you leave?
raj Actually, I’m still here.
howard What? You spent the night?
raj Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.
howard You wore my pyjamas?
raj Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.
mrs_wolowitz Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?
raj Oh, boy. Breakfast.
howard Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.
raj But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
howard If you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.
raj Oh, Howard, stop.
howard Trust me, you’re not Jewish. That’s how they get you.
raj You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
howard Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?
raj They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey.
sheldon Hello, home wrecker.
penny What did I do?
sheldon You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
penny Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with me.
sheldon Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
penny No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
sheldon You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
penny Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.
sheldon Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why don’t you just tell him?
penny Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.
sheldon That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
penny Well, I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
sheldon I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.
penny Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
howard Here’s some more ice.
bernadette Oh, thanks.
howard What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.
bernadette Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
howard Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
bernadette If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour.
howard Hey, Raj. What’s up?
raj You were right. I can’t get out of here.
howard You’re still at my mother’s?
raj I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?
howard Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.
raj Come on, Howard, help me.
mrs_wolowitz Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.
raj Oh, my God. She’s not gonna bathe me, is she?
howard Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.
raj But, Howard…
bernadette Should we go back and rescue him?
howard It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
amy Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
sheldon Is it kung pao chicken?
amy Yes.
sheldon Brown rice, not white rice?
amy Yes.
sheldon Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
amy Yes. I did good, right?
sheldon Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?
amy No.
sheldon Yeah, why would you?
amy Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.
sheldon Hello. This is Sheldon.
amy And this is Amy.
sheldon We’re not home right now.
amy ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.
together Leave a message.
amy Beep.
sheldon You can’t live here.
amy What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.
sheldon No. It’s not the message.
amy Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.
sheldon You did.
amy Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t live here.
sheldon It’s Penny’s fault.
amy What?
sheldon She doesn’t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the reason we can’t be happy.
penny Hey, Ames.
amy Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with Leonard.
leonard What?
penny Sheldon, what did you say?
sheldon I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard, and you know it.
leonard Since when don’t you want to live with me?
penny Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
sheldon Yeah, I think we should talk about that.
penny And since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
sheldon I thought we were talking about the other thing.
amy You’re a coward.
sheldon Well, the evidence does support that.
penny Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.
amy You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.
penny Um…
sheldon Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
leonard ‘Kay.
sheldon Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
leonard No.
sheldon Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.
mrs_wolowitz Where you going?
raj No!
