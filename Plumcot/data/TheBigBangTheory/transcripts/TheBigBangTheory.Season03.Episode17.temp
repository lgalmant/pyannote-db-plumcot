leonard Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
sheldon Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
leonard One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle.
penny Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving.
leonard Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food.
penny Why not?
leonard Don’t panic, this is better.
penny Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?
sheldon Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.
penny Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
leonard We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.
penny Who’s Adam West?
sheldon Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
howard My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one.
leonard Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
howard They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
leonard We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
penny There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
leonard No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.
howard Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?
penny That is so sad.
sheldon No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman.
leonard Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.
penny Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
leonard Okay, bye.
penny Okay.
leonard Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
raj And an Aquaman action figure.
howard Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
raj Huh? That’ll come off.
howard You see what you’re doing? Stop that.
sheldon Fascinating.
leonard What?
sheldon It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
leonard Oh.
raj It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
sheldon It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
raj One Ring to find them.
howard One Ring to bring them all.
leonard And in the darkness bind them.
raj Holy crap, are we nerdy.
howard So, I was doing some checking on the ring.
raj Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?
sheldon Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.
raj No, that’s okay. I’ll get it.
howard Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.
leonard Seedy underbelly?
howard You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.
raj Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
howard Just a guy. I know a guy.
raj Is it Eddie Crispo?
howard No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking.
raj Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
howard I know lots of dangerous people, okay?
raj Name one.
howard Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal.
sheldon If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.
leonard He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?
howard No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.
sheldon Mine!
leonard No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
sheldon Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.
leonard How is this maritime salvage?
sheldon Other than the lack of water, how is it not?
raj Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?
howard Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…
raj Your guy Eddie Crispo?
howard Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.
raj Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.
howard Why do you want a jet ski?
raj All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
sheldon We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
howard It’s sad how great that sounds.
leonard Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.
howard Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
raj There are no Jewish hobbits.
howard Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.
leonard We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?
sheldon You mean my ring?
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
leonard Give me that.
raj Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.
sheldon I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
leonard You always get your way.
sheldon I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
penny Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?
leonard Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.
penny What ring?
leonard This ring.
sheldon Looking for something?
leonard Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
penny Why?
leonard It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it.
penny Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?
howard If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.
leonard How am I looking now?
sheldon Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
leonard What was that?
penny Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
leonard That’s my girl.
howard So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?
raj Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
leonard No.
raj I was afraid of that. Go ahead.
man_on_screen Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj’s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.
raj Also my cousin.
howard You brought a lawyer?
venkatesh Don’t answer that. I’ll get straight to the point. My client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.
leonard We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
venkatesh Look, we’re big boys, why don’t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.
leonard No Jet Skis.
venkatesh All right, forget the Jet Skis.
raj Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
venkatesh What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.
raj You’re useless.
venkatesh I told you that when you hired me.
raj I’m signing off now.
venkatesh Call your mother, she worries.
howard Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.
leonard You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?
sheldon You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
leonard Give me that.
sheldon No, it’s mine.
raj It’s all of ours.
leonard Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
howard Then let go!
leonard I’m not letting go, you let go.
howard I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
leonard Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
raj Sure. Let go of the ring.
leonard All right, it starts now.
howard You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.
raj Wait, my laptop.
howard You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic.
leonard And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
sheldon I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
leonard You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
raj There are six seasons, dude.
leonard Oh, crap!
raj No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride.
leonard Door.
raj Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.
penny Whatcha doin’?
leonard Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.
penny No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.
leonard Thank you.
penny FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret.
leonard I’m out.
howard I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.
raj No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!
howard Will you be quiet?
raj Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!
howard I’ll call you back.
raj I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies.
howard Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
raj If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.
sheldon Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?
raj Why don’t we go after your mother?
sheldon Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?
howard That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
raj You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
sheldon No! I call no Meemaws.
raj Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
sheldon I don’t want to hear this.
howard Then let go of the ring and walk away.
sheldon Never.
howard All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
sheldon Stop it!
raj Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.
sheldon I said stop it!
howard We’re getting to him.
sheldon Waterfalls!
raj What?
sheldon Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
howard What are you doing?
sheldon Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
raj It’s, it’s not working, dude.
sheldon Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee.
raj Then let go of the ring and go.
howard No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too.
raj Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…
sheldon Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?
howard We stand up.
sheldon Excellent choice.
raj Three.
howard Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
sheldon I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine! We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. Where’s the ring?
leonard It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
raj The fires of Mount Doom?
leonard Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
howard You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
leonard I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.
raj Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner.
leonard There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! My precious.
sheldon I knew it. Give us the precious!
leonard NEVER!
penny Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
