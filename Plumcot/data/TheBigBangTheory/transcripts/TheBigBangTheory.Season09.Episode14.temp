sheldon Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI.
leonard If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb.
penny Yeah.
sheldon Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.
penny What is that?
sheldon Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder.
penny Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.
leonard That someone has a name.
sheldon Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.
leonard Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
penny I park fine.
sheldon Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!
leonard Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her.
sheldon Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.
sheldon That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.
leonard Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
sheldon And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is.
leonard Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology.
sheldon Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.
leonard Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
sheldon Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart.
leonard Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
meemaw Moon Pie.
sheldon Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.
meemaw I’m so happy to see you, too.
sheldon Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.
leonard Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.
meemaw Thank you.
sheldon No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four.
meemaw Is that nice to say to your friend?
sheldon It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
leonard Can you please live with us forever?
howard That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?
raj I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?
howard I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.
raj She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.
girl Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?
raj Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.
girl Which is probably why that movie sucks.
howard Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.
raj I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?
girl I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
howard Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago.
girl Wow. You’ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?
howard You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
raj It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.
sheldon Are you comfortable?
meemaw Very. It’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.
sheldon You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.
amy Hi. Nice to meet you.
meemaw Nice to meet you, too.
amy How was your trip?
meemaw Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.
amy That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there.
sheldon Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.
amy Can I have a tissue?
meemaw Of course.
sheldon Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.
meemaw He’s been saying that since he was little. I still don’t know what it means.
sheldon Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.
meemaw Oh, now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.
sheldon If I did, would I find any?
meemaw Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.
sheldon That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
amy Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…
meemaw Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.
amy S, s, si, size me up?
meemaw Sheldon’s mother may be okay with you, but I’m not so easy.
amy Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me.
meemaw Oh, you better hope so.
sheldon A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.
meemaw Oh, you’re welcome, Moon Pie.
sheldon Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.
raj Oh, I see you’re reading Saga.
girl Yeah, I hear it’s pretty good.
raj It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.
girl I’ll take your word for it.
howard You should. He’s really looked.
raj I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.
howard Hi.
girl Claire.
raj Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire.
claire It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing.
howard You’re a screenwriter?
claire Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.
raj Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
claire You’re really a scientist?
raj Well, astrophysicist.
claire That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids.
raj Sure. I love animated movies.
howard He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.
raj Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
claire Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together.
raj Yeah, great.
claire See ya.
raj Yeah, bye.
howard What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.
raj So?
howard So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?
raj I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
howard Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?
raj I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
penny Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?
meemaw Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey.
sheldon Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.
meemaw Thank you, Moon Pie.
amy I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?
meemaw ‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy.
leonard_and_penny She could just eat him up.
sheldon And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.
meemaw It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t.
amy Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar.
sheldon How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.
amy Well, now I know.
sheldon Yeah.
meemaw So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.
penny Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
meemaw Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.
amy I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.
meemaw That doesn’t bode well.
amy Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work.
meemaw Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby.
leonard That’s my best friend.
penny Yeah.
amy Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.
meemaw I appreciate your honesty, dear.
amy Thank you.
meemaw And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much.
amy Well, maybe I don’t like you either.
sheldon Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s.
amy I think I should leave.
sheldon But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time.
amy The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this.
meemaw Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.
amy What ring?
leonard Maybe we should give them some privacy.
penny Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
amy You have an engagement ring?
sheldon Yes.
amy Penny, did you know about this?
penny All right, let’s go.
amy When did you get an engagement ring?
sheldon My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
meemaw Well, thank goodness for that.
amy Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?
sheldon Oh, I don’t think I could do that.
meemaw Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.
sheldon I’m gonna opt out of that one, too.
amy Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.
sheldon All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?
meemaw You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.
amy Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
sheldon Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
bernadette Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her.
raj Just to help her with her screenplay.
bernadette Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad.
howard You weren’t there. He was really flirting.
raj Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.
bernadette I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
howard Really? So it’s okay if I fl…
bernadette Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?
raj Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?
howard No. Never.
bernadette Absolutely.
howard What?
bernadette Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.
howard Fine. I had reservations about you, too.
bernadette No, you didn’t.
howard No, I didn’t.
bernadette Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.
howard Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose.
penny Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.
leonard Did it?
penny Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.
sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
penny Come in.
leonard Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
sheldon No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
penny Uh-oh.
sheldon Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?
raj All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.
howard Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.
bernadette Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
howard And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.
raj I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
bernadette You’re right. It could totally happen.
claire Hello?
raj Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.
claire Hey, what’s up? Figure out what time you’re free?
raj Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.
claire Okay. Good for you.
raj Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.
claire I didn’t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.
raj Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?
claire Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
raj Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
claire Sure, we had a vibe.
raj I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?
bernadette You still have a girlfriend.
raj Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.
claire Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.
raj Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding.
claire Look, it’s just coffee. I’ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.
raj Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.
claire Great. I’ll text you.
raj Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.
bernadette Are you gonna tell Emily?
raj Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.
howard When are you gonna tell Emily?
raj He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
amy Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.
meemaw I know more than you think I do.
amy Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
meemaw Young lady, if you think I don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you’re wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.
amy Really?
meemaw There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.
amy Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?
meemaw Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again.
penny Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
sheldon No, I wouldn’t.
leonard Just get in here.
sheldon Hello.
penny Go ahead.
sheldon Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.
amy Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
sheldon Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.
meemaw I did.
sheldon Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.
leonard He never disappoints, does he?
amy I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?
sheldon Well…
penny Say yes.
sheldon Yes.
meemaw Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won’t stand in your way.
sheldon Thank you.
amy So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?
meemaw I suppose.
sheldon I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.
raj Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.
claire This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn’t too scary for children.
raj And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.
claire Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?
raj I will.
