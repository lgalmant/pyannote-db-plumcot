penny Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes.
sheldon Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
leonard Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
penny You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?
sheldon No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
leonard When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
sheldon Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
leonard Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
penny I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
leonard We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
penny Really? Why not?
leonard Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
penny Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?
leonard Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
penny Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
sheldon Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
penny So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
sheldon I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
penny What is it?
sheldon You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
penny Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.
sheldon Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.
leonard Here we go.
sheldon December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
leonard Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
sheldon I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.
penny No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
sheldon No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
leonard No, he doesn’t.
sheldon I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
leonard Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.
sheldon Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you.
penny What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?
leonard Tomorrow.
penny When were you going to tell me?
leonard Um, tomorrow?
penny Why were you keeping this a secret?
leonard Well, I just, I thought…
sheldon If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.
penny Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.
leonard You are, it’s just…
sheldon If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
penny Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts.
leonard I know. And those specials, they change every day.
penny Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on.
leonard Okay, sorry.
penny So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
leonard Um…
penny You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?
leonard Um…
penny Why not?
leonard Um…
sheldon Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
beverley It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.
sheldon No trouble at all.
leonard I drove, Mother. I’m driving now.
beverley Yes, dear. Mommy’s proud. I’ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
sheldon My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
leonard Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
sheldon August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
beverley Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?
sheldon You did.
beverley I don’t really like flowers.
sheldon Neither do I, but it’s the social convention.
beverley It is, isn’t it?
leonard Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?
beverley Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
leonard No, I heard that.
beverley Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?
leonard I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
beverley Well, I would assume it’s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.
sheldon It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
beverley Yes, but we are on the subject, so I’m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?
leonard Fine, Mom. How are you?
beverley Mmm, menopausal.
leonard Now I’m less fine.
beverley Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?
leonard No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?
sheldon My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
beverley She’s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.
leonard You must be very happy.
beverley Why? I’m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?
sheldon Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…
leonard Not the time, Sheldon.
sheldon Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
beverley It’s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard’s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.
sheldon Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.
beverley So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?
howard What? No.
beverley Why not?
howard Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
beverley I see.
howard No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
beverley And where is she this evening?
howard She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
beverley I see. Her grandmother died.
howard Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.
leonard I don’t know what you’re talking about.
howard What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
leonard All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
howard Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist.
beverley Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you’re hurting your partner.
howard Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
penny Hi. Sorry I’m late.
leonard Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
beverley Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?
penny Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no.
howard If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts.
beverley Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I’m divorcing yours.
leonard What?
beverley Yes. He was cheating on me.
leonard No!
beverley Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.
penny No, it sounded like a compliment.
leonard When did this happen?
beverley Mmm, well, let’s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard’s father?
sheldon September 22nd.
beverley Oh, yes, that’s right. The weekend after Leonard’s dog died.
leonard Mitzy’s dead?
sheldon She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
leonard I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
beverley Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who’s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?
leonard You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!
beverley So, Penny, what’s new in your life?
penny Nothing. Not a damn thing.
beverley Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.
penny Oh, it’s not a problem.
beverley I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don’t want someone like that operating heavy machinery.
penny No, you do not.
beverley Your check engine light is on.
penny Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.
beverley Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that’s not subjected to regular maintenance.
penny Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?
beverley Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that’s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.
penny Sure, sure.
beverley Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven’t had intercourse with him in eight years.
penny Eight years?
beverley Oh, that’s nothing. I’ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.
penny Yikes. What’s so funny?
beverley That’s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.
penny You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
beverley Oh, I don’t drink.
penny I do, I’ll teach you.
sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard What is it?
sheldon I made tea.
leonard I don’t want tea.
sheldon I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
leonard Then why are you telling me?
sheldon It’s a conversation starter.
leonard That’s a lousy conversation starter.
sheldon Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.
leonard What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
leonard I want that too. Why are you here?
sheldon To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
leonard Thank you, that’s very comforting.
sheldon That’s not the comforting part.
leonard It’s not?
sheldon No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
leonard You’re right, I do feel better.
sheldon Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.
leonard You’re my surrogate family?
sheldon If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night.
penny Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.
beverley Yikes.
penny I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
beverley I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.
penny As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine.
beverley Oh, that is fascinating. I’m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I’m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?
penny Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.
beverley Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.
penny Hey, Bev, guess what?
beverley What?
penny I’m sleeping with your son.
beverley Really? Which one?
penny The one from whom I live across the hall from.
beverley Well, that’s convenient. How did his penis turn out?
penny Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis.
beverley Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy’s penis?
penny Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.
beverley Really? Well, that means he’s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn’t care enough about his mother to tell her he’s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.
penny Well, let’s go find out who.
beverley You go get a taxi. I’m gonna slip my business card into that busboy’s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.
penny Leonard?
beverley Sonny boy!
penny Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
leonard What the hell is going on?
penny You’re in trouble.
beverley Why didn’t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?
penny Yeah, not bad, not bad.
leonard Are you guys drunk?
beverley Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?
penny Oh, thank you.
beverley You’re welcome. Is it because she’s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?
penny What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
leonard How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
beverley Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.
leonard I do.
beverley There. It’s late. Now, go to bed. I’m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.
penny That’s the Del Taco.
sheldon Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
beverley Speaking of warm feelings, come here. No, I’d rather have the busboy.
beverley Thank you for taking me to the airport.
sheldon You’re very welcome.
leonard Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here.
beverley Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you’ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.
sheldon I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
beverley Thank you.
sheldon I blame Penny.
penny I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.
leonard Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
beverley I think it’s best that you not know.
sheldon Agreed.
penny Agreed.
leonard What the hell, agreed.
beverley And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.
penny Oh, thank you, Beverly.
beverley You’re welcome. She doesn’t have much in the way of career prospects, don’t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.
leonard Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?
beverley Yes, dear.
leonard I’m over it.
penny Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.
