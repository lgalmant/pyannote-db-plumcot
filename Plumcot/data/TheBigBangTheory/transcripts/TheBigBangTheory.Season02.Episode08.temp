sheldon Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.
raj I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
sheldon How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
raj Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
leonard Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
sheldon In what sense is that a compromise?
leonard Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.
raj I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
sheldon Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
raj What?
sheldon It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
raj Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)
together Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!
howard_ Hello, boys.
leonard Ahoy, matey.
howard Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.
sheldon Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
leonard Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
howard Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.
raj What are negs?
howard A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?
leonard You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic.
penny_ Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
howard Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)
penny Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
howard Ow.
sheldon I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.
leonard Well, I want to watch it now.
sheldon Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
leonard Watch whatever you want.
raj I saw what you did there.
sheldon What did I do?
leonard_ Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there.
sheldon What happened?
leonard Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
sheldon Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush.
leonard What?
sheldon Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
leonard How can 5 not be worse than 1?
raj Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.
sheldon Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.
raj Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
sheldon No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.
leonard Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
raj Star Trek V!
raj I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
howard Oh, thank God, you’re here.
leonard What’s the emergency?
howard I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
sheldon Where?
howard On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
woman_ Howard, is everything okay?
howard Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in.
sheldon You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
howard Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish.
leonard Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?
howard No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”
sheldon So what exactly do you want us to do?
howard I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance.
sheldon Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
howard Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?
girl Hey, Howard, you know, it’s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?
howard Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.
girl Oh, okay. Let’s go, friend Leonard.
leonard Okay.
howard I’ll call ya.
girl Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?
leonard No one’s a scientist like Howard.
howard My mother is so gonna love her.
sheldon Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
girl I’m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?
leonard Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
girl I really like that you’re such a loyal friend.
leonard Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
girl Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.
leonard Then why did you?
girl He said that I could drive a car on Mars.
leonard Got it. So, can I see you again?
girl You’re not gonna see me now.
leonard Ooh. Cool.
howard Anything?
raj Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.
sheldon I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
howard Hang on, there’s got to be other options.
raj You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years.
sheldon Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
raj Oh, snap.
sheldon Snap what?
howard OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
raj What’s Plan B?
howard Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.
sheldon Why wasn’t that Plan A?
howard Thank God for Plan B.
penny Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
howard No, you’re mistaken.
penny Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
howard I don’t know what you’re talking about.
leonard Psst! Psst!
sheldon Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
penny No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
howard Well, that does sound like me, but no.
sheldon Is there some problem?
leonard Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
sheldon All right, goodbye.
leonard No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.
sheldon Where are you going?
leonard I can’t tell you that.
sheldon Who would ask me?
leonard I can’t tell you that, either.
sheldon So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
leonard Yeah, I really didn’t think this through.
sheldon Leonard, a moment.
leonard What?
sheldon If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?
leonard I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
sheldon Are you going to the office?
leonard No.
sheldon Then how can I say it convincingly?
leonard Just say, Leonard went to the office.
sheldon All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.
leonard What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
sheldon This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
leonard I’m going to the office.
sheldon See? Why don’t I believe you?
leonard I’m going out for a while.
howard Okay.
sheldon Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
penny Okay, where is he going?
sheldon Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.
leonard So how was work today?
girl Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.
leonard I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
girl No, just the one. He didn’t make it. So, how was your day?
leonard Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.
girl That’s it?
leonard Well, I wrote some of it down.
girl Are you done eating?
leonard Uh, yeah.
girl Oh, good. (Kisses him)
leonard If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.
phone_rings_answering_machine You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
howard_ Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard.
leonard I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
steph Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
leonard That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.
phone_rings_answering_machine You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
howard_ Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard.
leonard Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
steph Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
leonard Dear God, no!
steph_ Oh, Leonard…
phone_rings_answering_machine You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
howard_ Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.
howards_mother_ Tell her we’re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
howard_ We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!
howards_mother_ Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.
howard_ I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.
penny Oh, hey.
leonard Hey.
penny New shirts?
leonard Yeah, a couple.
penny Nice.
leonard Thank you.
penny So, who’s the girl?
leonard I’m sorry?
penny Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
leonard So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?
penny Well, yeah, we did have a date.
leonard Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
penny So, who is she?
leonard Oh, she’s a doctor.
penny Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
leonard Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?
penny Well, that depends.
leonard On what?
penny Is that friend Wolowitz?
leonard Yeah.
penny Screw him. You’re fine.
leonard Are you sure?
penny Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
leonard Does that change things?
penny No.
leonard So why’d you ask?
penny I’m nosy. See ya.
howards_mother_ Howard, get the door!
howard_ Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?
howards_mother_ Who is it?!
howard It’s Leonard!
howards_mother_ You’re gonna have to play outside! I’m not dressed to receive!
howard No one cares, Ma! So, what’s up?
leonard Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
howard_ Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried… Oh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… No, I understand… Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.
raj Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?
all Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
sheldon Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.
howard How do we decide that?
all Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
leonard Oh, hey, guys.
sheldon Hello.
raj Hey.
leonard Hi, Howard. Howard?
howard Sheldon.
sheldon Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
leonard That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
sheldon I don’t make the rules, Leonard.
leonard Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
howard Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
sheldon I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
raj You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.
leonard_ Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.
steph Is this a bad time?
leonard Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…
howard Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me.
steph Hello, Howard.
howard Sheldon?
sheldon Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.
leonard He just won’t listen to me.
steph Okay, I guess it’ll just be the three of us then.
leonard Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
steph Yeah.
howard Lisa?
steph Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.
howard Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!
howard So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.
leonard Howard, Howard, look at this.
howard Anyway, call me. It’s Howard.
voice_from_tv The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible.
howard Son of a bitch.
