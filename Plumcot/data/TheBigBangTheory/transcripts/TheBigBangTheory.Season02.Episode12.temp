howard All right, that’s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or…
all MONTE.
howard Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.
sheldon Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
raj As with my father, I both love and fear it.
howard All right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something.
together One, two, three, go.
raj Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
leonard Maybe we should start small.
raj Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball.
sheldon Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
raj Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.
leonard How about the toaster oven?
sheldon What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
leonard What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time.
howard Gentlemen, goggles.
sheldon Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.
raj How about “Die, toaster, die”?
leonard That’ll do it.
raj All right, what’s next?
penny No, I think I’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry.
howard Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.
penny Leonard?
leonard Uh-huh?
penny What the hell?
leonard Killer robot. We built it.
penny Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
sheldon If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead.
penny So, who exactly does it want to kill?
sheldon I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?
penny You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.
howard It’s a big deal. There’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you’d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
penny How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?
howard Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You’d be the only doable girl.
penny You’re a pig, Howard.
howard How is doable anything but a compliment?
leonard Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?
howard Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.
penny Our tango?
howard The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot.
leonard I’m begging you, stop talking.
penny Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you’re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.
sheldon Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar.
penny Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.
howard Um, so what are you saying?
penny I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.
howard Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious.
penny Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone.
howard Thanks for the heads up.
leonard Howard, where you going?
howard I’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.
leonard Wow.
penny Well, someone had to say it. What?
leonard He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
howards_mother Howard, the phone is ringing!
howard Here’s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!
howards_mother Hello? All right, hold on. It’s your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you’re not at school today!
howard I don’t go to school, Ma. I work at a university.
howards_mother That’s a school! Now pick up the phone!
howard I don’t want to talk to anybody.
howards_mother Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!
howard I don’t have homework. I’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
howards_mother Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?
howard Cherry, please!
howards_mother I ate the cherry. All that’s left is green.
howard You make me want to kill myself.
raj What’s going on?
leonard I don’t know, now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.
raj I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.
kripke Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?
leonard Yes, we did, Kripke.
sheldon His name is Monte.
kripke Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.
leonard Come on, is that really necessary?
sheldon Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight.
raj Oh, snap.
sheldon Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.
raj What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
sheldon There are boundaries.
kripke Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let’s settle this woboto a woboto.
sheldon What do you mean?
kripke There’s no guawantee we’ve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let’s thwow down. You know, unless you’re afwaid.
sheldon We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
kripke Tomowow, thwee o’clock, the kinetics wab.
sheldon Make it so.
leonard No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.
kripke What’s wrong with him?
raj He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
kripke We’re all pathetic and cweepy and can’t get girls, that’s why we fight wobots. If you’re not there, you’ll be exposed to widicule.
raj I’m curious, what part of America is that accent from?
penny Hey.
leonard Hey, you got a minute?
penny Yeah, come on in. What’s up?
leonard I need you to apologize to How…
penny Get out.
leonard Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
penny Well, then have the robot go and get him.
leonard The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
penny His feelings needed to be hurt.
leonard He’s been in bed for two days.
penny Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.
leonard He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.
penny Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?
leonard Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.
penny What does that mean?
leonard You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!
penny I turn into a bear?
leonard Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.
penny And say what? That I didn’t mean it, because I meant it.
leonard Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.
penny Oh, pthththth.
leonard Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.
penny Okay, come on, that’s not fair.
leonard I came home with no pants.
penny Fine, I’ll go over there tomorrow.
leonard Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
penny What about her?
leonard She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.
howards_mother Howard, there’s a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!
howard Who?
howards_mother Okay, now she’s saying it’s Penny.
howard I don’t want to talk to her.
penny Hey.
howard Ma!
howards_mother She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?
penny So, I just came by to see how you were doing.
howard I’m fine.
penny Good. Your mom seems nice.
howard People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
penny Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I’ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I’m sorry. Howard.
howard Fine, you’re sorry. Good-bye.
penny So, you’re okay?
howard Hey, I’m a big boy. I’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.
penny Okay. Well, bye. So close
leonard Oh, my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?
kripke As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.
raj I can’t watch anymore.
leonard Sheldon, we have to call it off.
sheldon We don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight.
leonard Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
sheldon Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.
raj Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
sheldon You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.
leonard You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
raj Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?
leonard Not yet.
sheldon Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
howard And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.
penny Aw, that sounds sweet.
howard Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…
penny Oh, it’s cute.
howard I guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin’ ’bout Marcy…
penny That’s great.
howard Grossman.
penny Oh, it’s fun.
howard And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.
penny Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?
howard Look at me. What chance do I have if I don’t try too hard?
penny Well, you’d have a terrific chance. I mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.
howard I guess.
penny Look, I’m telling you, I’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I’m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he’s a nice guy.
howard You really think so?
penny Yes.
howard I don’t know.
penny I do.
leonard Nice little bot you’ve got here.
kripke I’m aware.
leonard What’s this do, spin?
kripke Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.
leonard Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off.
sheldon No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.
raj But, Sheldon, we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
sheldon What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power.
raj That’s not overconfidence, that’s observation.
sheldon Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.
kripke What is his pwoblem?
raj Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.
leonard I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.
kripke Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.
sheldon He’s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.
kripke I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.
sheldon Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
kripke That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?
sheldon Do it.
kripke Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.
raj Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
sheldon Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. That’s new.
leonard Run, Monte, run!
raj Go, Monte! Go Monte!
leonard Go, go, go, go!
sheldon Don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,
leonard Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.
sheldon I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.
raj No one’s arguing with you, dude.
howard I got your text. How bad is… Oy.
leonard Forget the robot. What happened to you?
penny He slipped and fell.
howard Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.
penny Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect.
howard Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
sheldon So what do you think, Howard? It’s not that bad, right?
howard Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.
sheldon You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard, you’ll play your cello.
penny Sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it’s just a toy robot.
sheldon Just a toy robot?
leonard Penny.
penny I know, I got it. Sheldon, I’m sorry.
howard Well, don’t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I’m halfway to pity sex.
