leonard_hofstadter See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.
sheldon_cooper Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?
leonard_hofstadter Skynet is kinky? I don't know.
sheldon_cooper Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, oh wait, they use it to in...
sheldon_cooper , too late, I win.
penny Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell is that?
sheldon_cooper I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it too.
penny You wanna prowl, be my night owl, we'll take my... Hey guys, hi! Where you going?
leonard_hofstadter What? Oh we just had to... mail some letters and throw away some chicken.
penny You'll never guess what just happened.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I give up.
sheldon_cooper I don't guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
penny What was that?
leonard_hofstadter Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?
penny Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?
sheldon_cooper I have a conclusion based on an observation.
leonard_hofstadter No you don't. No he doesn't.
penny Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.
penny It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.
sheldon_cooper I think I know.
leonard_hofstadter No you don't. He doesn't.
penny It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 No.
leonard_hofstadter Because... uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
sheldon_cooper I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.
leonard_hofstadter No, it's this Friday, at eight.
penny Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.
leonard_hofstadter See you.
sheldon_cooper You just lied to Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, I did.
sheldon_cooper And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.
sheldon_cooper No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago.
leonard_hofstadter That's very true.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard...
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I need to speak to you.
leonard_hofstadter It's two o'clock in the morning
sheldon_cooper It's important.
leonard_hofstadter I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper You're right, it can wait until morning.
leonard_hofstadter What, what, what, what, what?
sheldon_cooper Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you're in no state to talk.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what is it?
sheldon_cooper I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
leonard_hofstadter What was I supposed to say.
sheldon_cooper You could have told her the truth.
leonard_hofstadter That would have hurt her feelings.
sheldon_cooper Is that a relevant factor?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
leonard_hofstadter And what would I have said afterwards?
sheldon_cooper I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing center of your brain.
leonard_hofstadter I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.
sheldon_cooper Why?
leonard_hofstadter It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.
sheldon_cooper I was not aware of that.
leonard_hofstadter Well now you are.
sheldon_cooper Oh, alright. Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, ...
leonard_hofstadter Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. What?
sheldon_cooper I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.
leonard_hofstadter How?
sheldon_cooper Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.
sheldon_cooper Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny, Good morning.
penny Do you have any idea what time it is?
sheldon_cooper Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.
penny What do you want?
sheldon_cooper Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
penny I remember symposium.
sheldon_cooper Yes, well, he lied.
penny Wait, what?
sheldon_cooper He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.
penny Well imagine how I'm feeling.
sheldon_cooper Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.
leonard_hofstadter You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?
sheldon_cooper To help you.
leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.
sheldon_cooper She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.
sheldon_cooper Hunger? Indigestion, I'm sorry I'm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.
leonard_hofstadter Your cousin Leopold?
sheldon_cooper Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it's important.
leonard_hofstadter What's important?
sheldon_cooper Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.
leonard_hofstadter Do you have a cousin Leopold.
sheldon_cooper No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee.
leonard_hofstadter I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?
sheldon_cooper Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
leonard_hofstadter Un-unravelable?
sheldon_cooper Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.
sheldon_cooper Ah, because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.
leonard_hofstadter We're going to Long Beach?
sheldon_cooper No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on!
sheldon_cooper We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
leonard_hofstadter So he goes back into rehab?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.
leonard_hofstadter You still told her I lied.
sheldon_cooper For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
leonard_hofstadter I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
sheldon_cooper That's the best part, you don't have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.
leonard_hofstadter So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?
sheldon_cooper Un-unravelable.
leonard_hofstadter Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.
penny Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, well, thankyou.
penny You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... when he has a symposium to go to.
leonard_hofstadter I don't know what to say.
penny It's okay, Leonard
leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay, alright, good.
howard_wolowitz Oh boy, group hug.
penny Uh-huh!
howard_wolowitz Uh-huh?
penny Uh-huh!
howard_wolowitz Okay. So what's up?
sheldon_cooper Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.
howard_wolowitz Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you're Bogarding the symposium.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, I'm sorry... we're... we're
howard_wolowitz No, no, you're quark-blocking us.
leonard_hofstadter I don't know what to say.
howard_wolowitz Wow.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, listen...
howard_wolowitz No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.
penny Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
sheldon_cooper Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that.
penny There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Well... I don't know what to say.
penny It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm...ian
sheldon_cooper Good for you.
penny Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.
howard_wolowitz No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step.
penny No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, another hug, thank you.
penny Alright you guys, good luck.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks Penny.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, uh, break a leg.
sheldon_cooper Break a leg.
howard_wolowitz So, road trip to Long Beach.
leonard_hofstadter No, we're not going to Long Beach.
raj_koothrappali Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
raj_koothrappali Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
sheldon_cooper It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.
raj_koothrappali Sounds fun.
howard_wolowitz I'm game.
raj_koothrappali Shotgun.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard...
leonard_hofstadter Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
sheldon_cooper No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.
sheldon_cooper Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
sheldon_cooper Because Leo is a middle child.
leonard_hofstadter There is no Leo, how can you say that?
sheldon_cooper You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.
leonard_hofstadter I've got a solution.
sheldon_cooper Great, what is it?
leonard_hofstadter Get out.
sheldon_cooper Fine. I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess. We'll talk in the morning.
strange_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 Morning.
leonard_hofstadter Who are you?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 Au contraire. I'm 26 years old, I'm originally from Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.
sheldon_cooper For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I'm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.
toby_loobenfeld It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?
sheldon_cooper Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.
leonard_hofstadter Oh...!
toby_loobenfeld Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.
sheldon_cooper No. We're going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.
toby_loobenfeld Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?
sheldon_cooper Subtextually, of course. Just have fun with it. Morning Penny.
penny Hi. How did the intervention go.
sheldon_cooper Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.
penny Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.
sheldon_cooper But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbor.
penny Hi Leo, how are you feeling?
toby_loobenfeld Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?
penny No.
toby_loobenfeld Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.
leonard_hofstadter Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?
penny Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.
leonard_hofstadter There were only two people there?
penny By the end. Yeah.
toby_loobenfeld Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!
penny I'm... I'm sorry.
toby_loobenfeld The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.
sheldon_cooper Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
toby_loobenfeld That's never been proven.
sheldon_cooper There have been studies.
toby_loobenfeld Not double blind studies.
sheldon_cooper How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.
leonard_hofstadter As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy.
penny Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?
leonard_hofstadter Sounds good.
penny I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?
leonard_hofstadter Gee, why wouldn't I?
penny This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah! Funny how things work out.
toby_loobenfeld And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
sheldon_cooper Your parents made the right decision.
toby_loobenfeld I cannot work like this!
toby_loobenfeld This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or... or... wondering if you're a dude down there.
penny Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay.
toby_loobenfeld One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.
leonard_hofstadter How long is he going to stay here.
sheldon_cooper He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
