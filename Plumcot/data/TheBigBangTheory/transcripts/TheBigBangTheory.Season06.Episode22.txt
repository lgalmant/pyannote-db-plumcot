leonard_hofstadter The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.
penny Got it.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
leonard_hofstadter Nice shot.
penny Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
sheldon_cooper Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Who’s Professor Proton?
leonard_hofstadter He was the host of this great… Hey!
penny Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
sheldon_cooper Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
leonard_hofstadter It was pretty cool.
penny Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
leonard_hofstadter Hire him to do what?
sheldon_cooper Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
leonard_hofstadter It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.
leonard_hofstadter Do you remember his old theme song?
sheldon_cooper Of course I do.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.
raj_koothrappali Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
howard_wolowitz Why don’t you put her in a kennel?
raj_koothrappali Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
howard_wolowitz To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
sheldon_cooper It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding.
howard_wolowitz You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
sheldon_cooper And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
howard_wolowitz How’d you get him to come to your house?
sheldon_cooper As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
leonard_hofstadter And he wrote him a cheque.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
raj_koothrappali Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
howard_wolowitz You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?
raj_koothrappali And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
howard_wolowitz Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
raj_koothrappali It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.
howard_wolowitz Classy dog.
raj_koothrappali Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.
howard_wolowitz I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, are you in bed?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Me, too.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper I can’t sleep.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I can, so shut up.
sheldon_cooper Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
sheldon_cooper I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
sheldon_cooper Do you have cufflinks?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, good night.
sheldon_cooper Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I still can’t sleep.
howard_wolowitz She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
howard_wolowitz It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
bernadette_rostenkowski And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, that’s what I was doing.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
howard_wolowitz Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where’d she go?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.
howard_wolowitz No, I wasn’t. You were.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I wasn’t.
howard_wolowitz Yes, you were!.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.
sheldon_cooper I’m getting worried.
penny Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.
sheldon_cooper Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Where is he?
sheldon_cooper The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
leonard_hofstadter Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.
arthur_jeffries I agree.
sheldon_cooper Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.
arthur_jeffries Just, just call me Arthur.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
arthur_jeffries No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.
sheldon_cooper Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
arthur_jeffries Is, uh, is he dangerous?
leonard_hofstadter Actually, he’s a genius.
sheldon_cooper I am.
arthur_jeffries That doesn’t answer my question.
leonard_hofstadter Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
arthur_jeffries Hi.
penny Hello.
arthur_jeffries Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.
arthur_jeffries Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, sir.
arthur_jeffries You’re the genius.
penny So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
arthur_jeffries It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.
leonard_hofstadter We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
arthur_jeffries Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living.
leonard_hofstadter That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
arthur_jeffries You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
arthur_jeffries You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
arthur_jeffries No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
arthur_jeffries I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?
bernadette_rostenkowski Cinnamon!
howard_wolowitz Cinnamon!
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.
howard_wolowitz Good thinking. Cinnamon, come to Daddy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?
howard_wolowitz Nice.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks.
howard_wolowitz When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.
bernadette_rostenkowski It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
howard_wolowitz Cinnamon!
arthur_jeffries Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?
penny I think I know.
sheldon_cooper It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
penny Okay, I didn’t know.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny See, I’m not a scientist like them.
arthur_jeffries I, I figured that out.
sheldon_cooper Potato clock. Do potato clock.
penny What’s that?
arthur_jeffries I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.
penny Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?
arthur_jeffries No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.
sheldon_cooper What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
arthur_jeffries No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.
leonard_hofstadter Then what is it?
arthur_jeffries I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.
sheldon_cooper Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
arthur_jeffries What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
sheldon_cooper Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something.:14:11,446
penny I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
arthur_jeffries Uh, thanks.
penny But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
arthur_jeffries What do you two talk about?
sheldon_cooper I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
arthur_jeffries I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
sheldon_cooper Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
arthur_jeffries No, I, I get that.
sheldon_cooper But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
leonard_hofstadter I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
arthur_jeffries Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.
leonard_hofstadter It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
arthur_jeffries Uh-oh.
penny Arthur, are you okay?
arthur_jeffries I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll, I’ll call for help.
penny Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
arthur_jeffries No.
raj_koothrappali Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.
paramedic Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe.
leonard_hofstadter You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
sheldon_cooper I’ll do it.
arthur_jeffries He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?
paramedic No, that’s not a rule. He can go.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah.
arthur_jeffries I can’t catch a break today.
penny We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry things turned out this way.
arthur_jeffries Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs.
sheldon_cooper Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.
bernadette_rostenkowski Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.
howard_wolowitz Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?
howard_wolowitz It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
raj_koothrappali Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
howard_wolowitz What?
raj_koothrappali A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.
howard_wolowitz You have her?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thank God she’s okay.
raj_koothrappali Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.
howard_wolowitz I’m really sorry.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?
raj_koothrappali Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
bernadette_rostenkowski So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?
raj_koothrappali Well, I, I thought about…
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.
raj_koothrappali Sorry. I, I just…
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
howard_wolowitz Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
sheldon_cooper Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
arthur_jeffries Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.
sheldon_cooper Want me to sing it again?
arthur_jeffries No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
sheldon_cooper There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
arthur_jeffries No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
sheldon_cooper Name it.
arthur_jeffries Well, I’m, I’m booked to do a children’s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don’t feel up to it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re not. You look awful.
arthur_jeffries Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you’d fill in for me.
sheldon_cooper Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
arthur_jeffries Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
arthur_jeffries Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
sheldon_cooper But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
arthur_jeffries Sounds great.
sheldon_cooper So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.
arthur_jeffries What, Whatever.
sheldon_cooper Father.
arthur_jeffries Sure, what the hell.
