amy And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.
leonard That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
amy About five weeks.
penny Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?
amy Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.
penny Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?
amy They didn’t say.
leonard Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
penny Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.
amy Really?
penny Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place.
amy You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?
penny No, not at all.
leonard And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.
amy So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?
penny I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
amy Oh, my, this is a big step.
leonard Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction.
sheldon Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
sheldon Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.
leonard It’s only for five weeks.
penny Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall.
amy What do you think?
sheldon I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?
penny Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.
sheldon Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven.
leonard You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.
amy Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?
sheldon Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
leonard Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.
sheldon If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it.
penny Don’t be proud of that.
amy So, is that a yes?
sheldon Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.
penny Well, where would you go?
sheldon Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.
leonard And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914
penny Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?
sheldon Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here.
leonard That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.
sheldon Historically, I don’t do well with change.
penny Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone.
sheldon You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.
leonard Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.
amy Sheldon, what do you think?
sheldon Very well. I’m on board.
amy Seriously?
sheldon Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
amy Oh. This is so exciting.
sheldon Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three.
raj I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.
howard Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.
raj I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.
bernadette It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
raj The polite response is, thank you for noticing.
bernadette Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.
howard Yeah, we could name him Blobert.
bernadette What if it’s a girl?
howard Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.
bernadette Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
howard Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
raj If you want, you can find out right now.
howard Mm.
bernadette Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter.
raj Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.
bernadette You looked in our folder?!
raj It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.
howard So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?
raj Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
howard It’s unbelievable.
bernadette God, Raj.
raj What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you.
bernadette We don’t want you to know.
raj Okay, well, that’s a problem.
penny You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.
sheldon Oh. Thank you.
penny Mm.
sheldon Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done.
penny That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?
sheldon Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?
penny Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.
sheldon You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.
amy You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?
leonard I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.
penny I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.
leonard Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.
penny Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.
leonard Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
penny You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space.
leonard He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.
sheldon How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
amy I don’t know. I didn’t count.
sheldon You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
amy That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?
sheldon Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.
amy Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.
sheldon Okay. Talk.
amy Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.
sheldon Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.
amy Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it.
sheldon You’re really okay with that?
amy I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.
sheldon This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now.
amy Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
sheldon I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.
penny Well, here’s your key.
amy Thank you.
sheldon Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
leonard You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
sheldon It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
penny Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional.
amy Shall we?
sheldon I guess this is it.
leonard You guys have fun.
sheldon You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.
penny Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.
sheldon Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.
leonard I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together.
sheldon Leonard, please, let me go.
amy Come on, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh. Bye.
leonard Good night.
penny Good night.
amy Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.
sheldon I guess the experiment begins.
penny Wa-how, we did it.
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Which side of the bed would you prefer?
amy Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.
sheldon No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.
amy Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.
sheldon Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.
amy Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate.
sheldon Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?
amy Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?
sheldon Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.
amy Great. That’s your side.
sheldon No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.
amy Okay, I’ll take that side.
sheldon Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?
amy Rising rapidly.
sheldon Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.
amy Okay. What if we do this?
sheldon I suppose that works.
amy Great.
sheldon Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
bernadette This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?
howard I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
bernadette I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
howard But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
bernadette Everyone said I could do better.
howard But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da.
amy Ugh. What is that? Why did you switch sides?
sheldon Be grateful I’m still in the room.
amy Comfy?
sheldon Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers.
amy Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.
sheldon Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.
amy Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall.
sheldon Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it.
leonard That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night.
penny Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
leonard It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different.
penny So, what do you want to do?
leonard I know exactly what we are gonna do.
penny Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?
leonard Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.
penny Ugh. Can we just have sex?
leonard Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.
penny Inevitable, you say?
leonard I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
howard Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.
bernadette Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know.
howard But you just said you wanted to know.
bernadette Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!
raj Hello?
howard Call you back.
sheldon No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn.
penny Wow, where did you learn these moves?
leonard The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.
howard Okay, you’re positive you want to know?
bernadette Yes.
howard Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.
raj Hello?
bernadette Wait.
howard Wrong number.
penny I told you not to do the worm.
leonard You were right.
raj Hello.
bernadette I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.
amy Oh, oh, oh.
sheldon What are you doing down there?
amy Hang on.
sheldon Who are you calling? Aaargh!
amy I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.
penny Yeah, get it, girl.
amy It’s not what you think.
leonard I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?
penny Even more not what you think.
amy I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.
leonard If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.
penny Yeah.
sheldon Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?
amy Miserable and exhausted.
sheldon Really? I slept great.
amy Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault.
sheldon How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
amy Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.
sheldon Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?
amy The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
sheldon Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.
amy I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?
sheldon If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
penny Was that a science diss?
leonard Yeah.
penny Was it a good one?
leonard Eh.
penny Oh.
amy What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables.
sheldon How dare you?
amy Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.
sheldon Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?
amy Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.
penny I feel like I should say damn.
leonard Do it.
penny Damn.
sheldon Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.
amy Well, for science, maybe I will.
sheldon For science, maybe you should.
amy Fine.
sheldon Fine.
amy Good.
sheldon Great.
amy Do you want to go to our place and make out?
sheldon Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
penny The new neighbours are weird.
