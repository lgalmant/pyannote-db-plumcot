penny Hey, you guys ready to order?
howard_wolowitz Uh..
leonard_hofstadter Sure
penny Okay, Priya?
priya_koothrappali Uh, I’ll have the Shepherd’s Pie. You want to split that with me?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.
priya_koothrappali Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.
sheldon_cooper Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.
leonard_hofstadter So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?
leonard_hofstadter Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
howard_wolowitz You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.
leonard_hofstadter Kill me.
sheldon_cooper It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
bernadette_rostenkowski Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news.
sheldon_cooper Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?
leonard_hofstadter So, what’s your news, Bernadette?
bernadette_rostenkowski The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.
penny Oh!
sheldon_cooper Oh, congratulations.
penny Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.
howard_wolowitz Congratulations, honey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
sheldon_cooper Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.
howard_wolowitz Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!
howard_wolowitz What?
leonard_hofstadter Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?
howard_wolowitz Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor.
penny Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.
raj_koothrappali Oh, if there was a problem, you can’t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. .
priya_koothrappali Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.
leonard_hofstadter You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.
priya_koothrappali Shh, my brother’s going to hear you.
leonard_hofstadter Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship.
raj_koothrappali Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
priya_koothrappali I can’t believe I’m wearing my brother’s Halloween costume.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.
raj_koothrappali Okay, gotta go.
howard_wolowitz Hey, what’s up?
debbie_wolowitz Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?
howard_wolowitz No, Ma! It’s Raj!
debbie_wolowitz He’s a doctor too, right?
howard_wolowitz Yes!
debbie_wolowitz Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!
debbie_wolowitz Well, whose fault is that?
howard_wolowitz What’s up?
raj_koothrappali Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
howard_wolowitz Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother.
raj_koothrappali I guess that’s okay.
howard_wolowitz Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!
debbie_wolowitz Of course, he and I can play doctor!
raj_koothrappali She’s kidding, right?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.
debbie_wolowitz Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!
sheldon_cooper I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.
sheldon_cooper Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?
sheldon_cooper It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you considered massage?
sheldon_cooper I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
amy_farrah_fowler I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
sheldon_cooper Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
amy_farrah_fowler Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
sheldon_cooper All right.
amy_farrah_fowler Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
sheldon_cooper Rotating.
amy_farrah_fowler You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
sheldon_cooper You mean the myofascial point?
amy_farrah_fowler Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
sheldon_cooper There’s someone at my door.
amy_farrah_fowler That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.
raj_koothrappali Can I sleep here tonight?
sheldon_cooper Why?
raj_koothrappali Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
sheldon_cooper I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
raj_koothrappali Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.
sheldon_cooper No, I can’t authorize that.
raj_koothrappali Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?
sheldon_cooper The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.
raj_koothrappali Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.
sheldon_cooper All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.
raj_koothrappali Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.
raj_koothrappali You’re kidding.
sheldon_cooper I never kid about safety.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
raj_koothrappali I was sleeping.
leonard_hofstadter In my bed?
raj_koothrappali Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you heard?
raj_koothrappali Scotty, I need more power.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
raj_koothrappali Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?
leonard_hofstadter We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.
raj_koothrappali Can I bring girls here?
leonard_hofstadter You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
raj_koothrappali Okay, deal.
leonard_hofstadter Just not against their will.
leonard_hofstadter Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
howard_wolowitz Why?
leonard_hofstadter If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.
raj_koothrappali He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.
leonard_hofstadter Until you have kids.
sheldon_cooper Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while.
raj_koothrappali When did you take my blood?
sheldon_cooper Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.
raj_koothrappali What the hell is this?
sheldon_cooper Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
raj_koothrappali This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
sheldon_cooper As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign.
raj_koothrappali Did you sign this?
leonard_hofstadter There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.
raj_koothrappali Well, that seems fair.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.
leonard_hofstadter Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
sheldon_cooper Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.
leonard_hofstadter No backsies.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, dinner!
sheldon_cooper What is this?
raj_koothrappali This is the difference between eating and dining.
sheldon_cooper Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
raj_koothrappali It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
penny Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
sheldon_cooper Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
penny Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?
sheldon_cooper My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. Uh, nice touch, by the way.
penny What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
sheldon_cooper The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
raj_koothrappali I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
penny All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?
raj_koothrappali He’s living at my place, so I’m living here.
sheldon_cooper You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
penny Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.
sheldon_cooper No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline.
raj_koothrappali It’s a good thing.
howard_wolowitz So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.
howard_wolowitz Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to.
bernadette_rostenkowski I wanted to. Come on, open it.
howard_wolowitz You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.
raj_koothrappali More wine?
penny Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already.
sheldon_cooper Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
penny Hit me.
sheldon_cooper Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
penny Monkeys.
sheldon_cooper When does a monkey have a trunk?
penny When a suitcase just won’t do.
sheldon_cooper Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.
penny Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?
raj_koothrappali Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
penny What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack.
raj_koothrappali Every night.
penny Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
raj_koothrappali It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
penny Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
penny I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
raj_koothrappali Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.
penny Oh, you poor baby.
raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with me, Penny?
penny Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
raj_koothrappali Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
penny I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.
raj_koothrappali To friendship.
sheldon_cooper Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
leonard_hofstadter Mmm. Mmm.
priya_koothrappali Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
priya_koothrappali That’s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?
priya_koothrappali Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time.
leonard_hofstadter When is the time?
priya_koothrappali I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
priya_koothrappali Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
dr_vm_koothrappali We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?
priya_koothrappali No.
mrs_koothrappali Where is your brother?
priya_koothrappali Out with friends.
dr_vm_koothrappali I don’t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.
mrs_koothrappali I’ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
leonard_hofstadter You’re moving back to India?
dr_vm_koothrappali Who’s that?
mrs_koothrappali Oh, my God! There’s someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!
leonard_hofstadter When were you going to tell me about this?
priya_koothrappali Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh’s friend Leonard.
dr_vm_koothrappali I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.
priya_koothrappali He has many friends.
dr_vm_koothrappali Rajesh has many friends?
mrs_koothrappali Why are you lying to us?
leonard_hofstadter She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
priya_koothrappali Leonard!
leonard_hofstadter Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up.
priya_koothrappali You know what? I don’t want to deal with this right now.
leonard_hofstadter So. Hot in India?
dr_vm_koothrappali Of course it is. It always is. It’s India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
leonard_hofstadter Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
penny Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? Really? Still can’t talk to me?
sheldon_cooper What are you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I said, what are you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter I live here.
sheldon_cooper I have paperwork that says differently.
leonard_hofstadter Priya’s going back to India.
sheldon_cooper Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it. What are you doing here?
howard_wolowitz I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper Why?
howard_wolowitz She gave me a beautiful watch.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you understand this?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Talk to him.
penny Damn.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
penny Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like.
sheldon_cooper What does it look like?
