penny Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?
leonard_hofstadter ‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
penny I got asked to sign autographs there.
leonard_hofstadter That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
penny Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.
leonard_hofstadter When is it?
penny It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.
leonard_hofstadter What? Why not?
penny You just said yourself, it’s sad.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.
penny I don’t know.
leonard_hofstadter You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.
penny I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.
penny Oh, yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.
sheldon_cooper We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what I meant.
sheldon_cooper All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry I mentioned it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.
howard_wolowitz That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.
bernadette_rostenkowski Which MIT did you go to?
howard_wolowitz Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.
howard_wolowitz Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
bernadette_rostenkowski The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
howard_wolowitz Are we even in a good school…? Ow!
bernadette_rostenkowski I warned you, and I did it.
penny What’s all this?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.
penny Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.
penny Who’s that?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?
penny Oh, there’s so much I want to change.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s going on here?
sheldon_cooper You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?
sheldon_cooper Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
amy_farrah_fowler You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s an odd mix of people.
sheldon_cooper Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
amy_farrah_fowler You never went into that haunted house.
sheldon_cooper You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have
sheldon_cooper Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, where you been?
howard_wolowitz Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.
raj_koothrappali Wait till you see the crib we found.
bernadette_rostenkowski You bought a crib without me?
howard_wolowitz You’re gonna love it.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sounds expensive.
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety.
raj_koothrappali Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.
howard_wolowitz But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine.
howard_wolowitz In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?
bernadette_rostenkowski You bought a minivan?
howard_wolowitz It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.
raj_koothrappali Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.
howard_wolowitz The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore.
raj_koothrappali Then again, he did think you were my husband.
bernadette_rostenkowski They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?
leonard_hofstadter Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
penny Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.
penny Alright, why not five and ten bucks?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.
penny Hey, that guy’s looking over here.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?
penny I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi.
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Hi. I love your movie.
penny Well, thanks.
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life.
penny Your love confuses me.
leonard_hofstadter Would you like an autograph?
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Sure.
penny Okay. Who do I make it out to?
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Daniel.
penny Okay.
daniel I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?
penny That did not clear things up.
leonard_hofstadter That’ll be four seventy-five.
daniel Keep the change.
leonard_hofstadter But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.
amy_farrah_fowler There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.
amy_farrah_fowler Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.
sheldon_cooper Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
bert_kibbler I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.
amy_farrah_fowler How old was it
bert_kibbler It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it.
sheldon_cooper Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?
mrs_petrescu Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s.
sheldon_cooper She’s learning English from TV.
mrs_petrescu TV, good. Now back to you.
stuart_bloom Hey, guys.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Stuart.
stuart_bloom These are for you.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
stuart_bloom Nice to meet you.
mrs_petrescu Hello.
bert_kibbler Hey.
stuart_bloom So, what did I miss?
bert_kibbler Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.
mrs_petrescu 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
stuart_bloom Anybody else coming to this thing?
penny What’s your name?
jeff Jeff.
penny Okay.
jeff My favourite part is your shower scene.
penny Been hearing that a lot today.
jeff I even have a screen grab on my phone.
penny Yep, there they are.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s keep it moving.
penny Here you go.
leonard_hofstadter Should’ve punched that guy.
penny Well, go ahead. He’s right over there.
leonard_hofstadter Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?
penny Hello.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Hi. I like your movies.
penny Thank you.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 I saw both of them.
penny I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 You think I could get a picture of us?
penny Oh, sure.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?
leonard_hofstadter No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
penny Leonard…
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. It’s not okay.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Who are you?
leonard_hofstadter I’m her husband.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 No, you’re not.
leonard_hofstadter I am.
penny Yeah, he really is.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 No.
howard_wolowitz It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future.
raj_koothrappali Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.
howard_wolowitz Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?
howard_wolowitz You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.
howard_wolowitz Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
howard_wolowitz Yes.
raj_koothrappali Yes.
howard_wolowitz See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, is it your back?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.
sheldon_cooper So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.
bert_kibbler I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.
amy_farrah_fowler Things didn’t work out?
bert_kibbler I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks.
mrs_petrescu My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.
stuart_bloom Really, no one else is coming?
sheldon_cooper This is it. You are the practice round.
stuart_bloom Practice round? For-for what?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.
sheldon_cooper You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.
stuart_bloom So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.
amy_farrah_fowler Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people.
sheldon_cooper Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 But how did you get her to go out with you?
leonard_hofstadter Well, she moved in across the hall.
penny And he started to slowly wear me down.
leonard_hofstadter Like a river carves a canyon.
penny Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.
redhaired_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Ready to go?
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.
redhaired_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker.
penny I think it’s hot.
leonard_hofstadter That’s right. I’m her change daddy.
howard_wolowitz Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
howard_wolowitz You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.
howard_wolowitz You’re right. It sells itself.
raj_koothrappali You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride.
bernadette_rostenkowski I was hoping it’d be quieter.
howard_wolowitz If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?
bernadette_rostenkowski Soon.
howard_wolowitz Why is it taking so long?
howard_wolowitz I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.
raj_koothrappali I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.
bert_kibbler This is the best blintz I’ve ever had.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Thank you.
bert_kibbler It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.
stuart_bloom You know what, I, I, I think I’m just gonna go.
amy_farrah_fowler No, Stuart, don’t.
stuart_bloom No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?
amy_farrah_fowler We’re so sorry.
stuart_bloom I’m always the last one anybody thinks of.
sheldon_cooper Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority.
stuart_bloom Bye.
sheldon_cooper Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.
bert_kibbler I know how it feels, too.
sheldon_cooper All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.
stuart_bloom Thank you.
sheldon_cooper You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.
bert_kibbler Hear, hear.
amy_farrah_fowler Cheers.
mrs_petrescu Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.
leonard_hofstadter And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times.
leonard_hofstadter The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.
penny You know, once, I proposed to him.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. I said no.
redhaired_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Why?
leonard_hofstadter I just wanted to make her work for it.
penny Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later.
redhaired_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 Hang on. Is she just with you because you’re rich?
leonard_hofstadter She makes more money than I do.
awkward_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 What? Who are you?
sheldon_cooper Do you know what else I love about you?
stuart_bloom Hmm?
sheldon_cooper Your handwriting is impeccable.
stuart_bloom Thank you for noticing.
sheldon_cooper No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker.
stuart_bloom You know what I love about you?
sheldon_cooper Hmm?
stuart_bloom You never leave the house without a paper clip.
sheldon_cooper You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
stuart_bloom I also love how you never use swear words.
sheldon_cooper You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
sheldon_cooper Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
