sheldon_cooper Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
sheldon_cooper How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
raj_koothrappali Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
leonard_hofstadter Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
sheldon_cooper In what sense is that a compromise?
leonard_hofstadter Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.
raj_koothrappali I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
sheldon_cooper Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!
howard_wolowitz Hello, boys.
leonard_hofstadter Ahoy, matey.
howard_wolowitz Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.
sheldon_cooper Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
leonard_hofstadter Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
howard_wolowitz Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.
raj_koothrappali What are negs?
howard_wolowitz A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?
leonard_hofstadter You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic.
penny Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
howard_wolowitz Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)
penny Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
howard_wolowitz Ow.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I want to watch it now.
sheldon_cooper Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
leonard_hofstadter Watch whatever you want.
raj_koothrappali I saw what you did there.
sheldon_cooper What did I do?
leonard_hofstadter Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there.
sheldon_cooper What happened?
leonard_hofstadter Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
sheldon_cooper Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
leonard_hofstadter How can 5 not be worse than 1?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.
sheldon_cooper Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.
raj_koothrappali Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.
leonard_hofstadter Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
raj_koothrappali Star Trek V!
raj_koothrappali I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
howard_wolowitz Oh, thank God, you’re here.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the emergency?
howard_wolowitz I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
sheldon_cooper Where?
howard_wolowitz On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
woman_#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Howard, is everything okay?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in.
sheldon_cooper You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?
howard_wolowitz No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”
sheldon_cooper So what exactly do you want us to do?
howard_wolowitz I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance.
sheldon_cooper Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
howard_wolowitz Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Hey, Howard, you know, it’s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Oh, okay. Let’s go, friend Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
howard_wolowitz I’ll call ya.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?
leonard_hofstadter No one’s a scientist like Howard.
howard_wolowitz My mother is so gonna love her.
sheldon_cooper Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 I’m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?
leonard_hofstadter Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 I really like that you’re such a loyal friend.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.
leonard_hofstadter Then why did you?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 He said that I could drive a car on Mars.
leonard_hofstadter Got it. So, can I see you again?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’re not gonna see me now.
leonard_hofstadter Ooh. Cool.
howard_wolowitz Anything?
raj_koothrappali Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.
sheldon_cooper I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, there’s got to be other options.
raj_koothrappali You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years.
sheldon_cooper Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
raj_koothrappali Oh, snap.
sheldon_cooper Snap what?
howard_wolowitz OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
raj_koothrappali What’s Plan B?
howard_wolowitz Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.
sheldon_cooper Why wasn’t that Plan A?
howard_wolowitz Thank God for Plan B.
penny Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
howard_wolowitz No, you’re mistaken.
penny Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know what you’re talking about.
leonard_hofstadter Psst! Psst!
sheldon_cooper Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
penny No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
howard_wolowitz Well, that does sound like me, but no.
sheldon_cooper Is there some problem?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
sheldon_cooper All right, goodbye.
leonard_hofstadter No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
leonard_hofstadter I can’t tell you that.
sheldon_cooper Who would ask me?
leonard_hofstadter I can’t tell you that, either.
sheldon_cooper So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I really didn’t think this through.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, a moment.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
sheldon_cooper Are you going to the office?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Then how can I say it convincingly?
leonard_hofstadter Just say, Leonard went to the office.
sheldon_cooper All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.
leonard_hofstadter What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
sheldon_cooper This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going to the office.
sheldon_cooper See? Why don’t I believe you?
leonard_hofstadter I’m going out for a while.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
sheldon_cooper Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
penny Okay, where is he going?
sheldon_cooper Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.
leonard_hofstadter So how was work today?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.
leonard_hofstadter I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 No, just the one. He didn’t make it. So, how was your day?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 That’s it?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I wrote some of it down.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Are you done eating?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Oh, good. (Kisses him)
leonard_hofstadter If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.
phone_rings_answering_machine#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
dr_stephanie_barnett Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
leonard_hofstadter That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.
phone_rings_answering_machine#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
howard_wolowitz Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
dr_stephanie_barnett Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
leonard_hofstadter Dear God, no!
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, Leonard…
phone_rings_answering_machine#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
howard_wolowitz Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.
debbie_wolowitz Tell her we’re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
howard_wolowitz We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!
debbie_wolowitz Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.
howard_wolowitz I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.
penny Oh, hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny New shirts?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, a couple.
penny Nice.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny So, who’s the girl?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry?
penny Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
leonard_hofstadter So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?
penny Well, yeah, we did have a date.
leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
penny So, who is she?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, she’s a doctor.
penny Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
leonard_hofstadter Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?
penny Well, that depends.
leonard_hofstadter On what?
penny Is that friend Wolowitz?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Screw him. You’re fine.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
penny Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Does that change things?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter So why’d you ask?
penny I’m nosy. See ya.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, get the door!
howard_wolowitz Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?
debbie_wolowitz Who is it?!
howard_wolowitz It’s Leonard!
debbie_wolowitz You’re gonna have to play outside! I’m not dressed to receive!
howard_wolowitz No one cares, Ma! So, what’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
howard_wolowitz Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried… Oh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… No, I understand… Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.
raj_koothrappali Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?
all@ Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
sheldon_cooper Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.
howard_wolowitz How do we decide that?
all@ Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, guys.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Howard. Howard?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
leonard_hofstadter That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
sheldon_cooper I don’t make the rules, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
howard_wolowitz Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
sheldon_cooper I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
raj_koothrappali You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.
dr_stephanie_barnett Is this a bad time?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…
howard_wolowitz Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me.
dr_stephanie_barnett Hello, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.
leonard_hofstadter He just won’t listen to me.
dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, I guess it’ll just be the three of us then.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Lisa?
dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!
howard_wolowitz So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, Howard, look at this.
howard_wolowitz Anyway, call me. It’s Howard.
voice_from_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible.
howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch.
