sheldon_cooper Leonard, are you in the shower?
leonard_hofstadter I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
sheldon_cooper I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
sheldon_cooper I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
leonard_hofstadter What kind of emergency?
sheldon_cooper Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
leonard_hofstadter You might not want to do that.
sheldon_cooper I assure you I do.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.
sheldon_cooper What?
priya_koothrappali Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
leonard_hofstadter We were in here first, you can’t be in here.
sheldon_cooper According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.
sheldon_cooper Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?
priya_koothrappali Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.
sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Move. Move. Move!
sheldon_cooper Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, fine.
priya_koothrappali Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
priya_koothrappali Proceed.
sheldon_cooper Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.
priya_koothrappali Can I see the roommate agreement?
sheldon_cooper Um, it’s fairly technical.
priya_koothrappali I think I can handle it.
leonard_hofstadter Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
priya_koothrappali All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Do so, do so.
priya_koothrappali Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.
priya_koothrappali Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?
sheldon_cooper Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
priya_koothrappali My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.
sheldon_cooper But…
priya_koothrappali There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works.
leonard_hofstadter Schooled!
priya_koothrappali As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.
leonard_hofstadter Superceded!
sheldon_cooper This isn’t over.
leonard_hofstadter No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.
raj_koothrappali Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
priya_koothrappali Seriously?
howard_wolowitz I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
sheldon_cooper What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
leonard_hofstadter I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
priya_koothrappali According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night.
sheldon_cooper Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s.
howard_wolowitz That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?
priya_koothrappali A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
sheldon_cooper No.
all@ Opa!
sheldon_cooper This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.
leonard_hofstadter Not as much as you.
sheldon_cooper Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
leonard_hofstadter I got you the lamb kabob.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny Hey. What’s up?
sheldon_cooper The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
penny Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.
sheldon_cooper A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.
penny Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.
sheldon_cooper Shotgun.
penny Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.
amy_farrah_fowler Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
sheldon_cooper Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
amy_farrah_fowler Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.
penny I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?
amy_farrah_fowler I need some context.
penny Pantsuits suck.
amy_farrah_fowler And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Whee-ee-ee!
amy_farrah_fowler You smell like baby powder.
sheldon_cooper It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know how to process that.
bernadette_rostenkowski I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
penny That’s too many S’s for kissing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
penny Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
sheldon_cooper Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s.
bernadette_rostenkowski That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
penny Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m available for experimentation.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .
sheldon_cooper I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
penny Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
sheldon_cooper No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
sheldon_cooper I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
penny Did you take dance lessons?
sheldon_cooper Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.
penny Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
sheldon_cooper No, you most certainly are not.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
sheldon_cooper I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
penny Take us to a place we can waltz.
taxi_driver#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Where you can what?
sheldon_cooper Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature.
taxi_driver#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Here we go.
amy_farrah_fowler I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it.
sheldon_cooper What happened to you?
penny Shake it baby, shake it!
bernadette_rostenkowski Muy caliente, Sheldon!
elderly_korean_gentleman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Care to dance?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.
korean#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 How about you?
penny Oh, what the hell. Ooh!
amy_farrah_fowler How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?
sheldon_cooper What’s 16 times 14?
amy_farrah_fowler My burps taste like cranberry juice.
sheldon_cooper And there’s your answer.
amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
sheldon_cooper If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.
amy_farrah_fowler I have yoo-hoo.
sheldon_cooper It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
amy_farrah_fowler Make yourself comfortable.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Is someone smoking?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that’s just Ricky.
sheldon_cooper You own a smoking monkey?
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
sheldon_cooper What’s he doing here?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
sheldon_cooper Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
amy_farrah_fowler A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.
sheldon_cooper is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
sheldon_cooper Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.
amy_farrah_fowler And you want me to kill her? Done.
sheldon_cooper No, of course not.
amy_farrah_fowler I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
sheldon_cooper I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.
amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
sheldon_cooper No.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
sheldon_cooper Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.
sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting I play dirty?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business.
sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
amy_farrah_fowler I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did.
sheldon_cooper Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
leonard_hofstadter Morning, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.
leonard_hofstadter Why would I want to do that?
sheldon_cooper Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
sheldon_cooper Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.
female_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Self-destruct sequence activated.
leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
sheldon_cooper That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.
priya_koothrappali So what happens when it counts down?
sheldon_cooper Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.
priya_koothrappali Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the big deal?
priya_koothrappali Trust me, it’s a big deal.
leonard_hofstadter They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?
priya_koothrappali Yeah, of course, just not today.
sheldon_cooper 20 seconds.
leonard_hofstadter Are you ashamed of me?
priya_koothrappali Of course not.
leonard_hofstadter Then why can’t we tell your parents?
priya_koothrappali Please, don’t push this.
sheldon_cooper He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.
priya_koothrappali Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.
leonard_hofstadter No, he’s bluffing.
sheldon_cooper I never bluff. Ten.
leonard_hofstadter It’s blackmail!
sheldon_cooper Nine.
priya_koothrappali We give up.
sheldon_cooper Eight.
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper It’s a laptop with a full charge.
