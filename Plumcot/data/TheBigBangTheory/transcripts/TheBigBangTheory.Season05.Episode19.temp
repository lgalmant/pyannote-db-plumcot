raj Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?
leonard Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.
howard You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
leonard Good point, I’m in.
raj You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
leonard You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
raj Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.
howard Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
leonard It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
howard They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
raj We were badass back in the day.
leonard All right, let’s do it.
howard 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
raj It’s on like Alderaan.
leonard Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon
raj Woo-hoo!
sheldon Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
leonard We are going to play the online game.
sheldon The online game? Bully!
amy Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party.
sheldon Just tell her I can’t come.
amy She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
sheldon She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.
amy No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none.
sheldon Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.
amy You use it to get your way.
sheldon I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
amy You gave me your word. You’re coming with me.
leonard We’ll miss you, Sheldon.
sheldon Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies.
howard Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres.
sheldon Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!
sheldon Hello Stuart.
stuart Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
sheldon Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?
stuart Uh, I don’t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
sheldon Do you supply the the tennis ball?
stuart No.
sheldon Then no. What else?
stuart Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
sheldon Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
stuart I’m sorry Sheldon, that’s it. That’s all I got.
sheldon Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
leonard I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
sheldon No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom.
leonard That’s what your father used to say?
sheldon Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.
howard Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.
raj I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
sheldon Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
howard Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation.
sheldon You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
leonard Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.
penny You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
leonard Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.
penny Really, what were you hoping for?
leonard I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
penny Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again.
leonard Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
penny Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.
leonard Ay papi? What is that?
penny An acting choice.
leonard Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
penny Choo got a problem with that, papi?
leonard Uh-uh.
sheldon Penny! Penny! Penny!
penny Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
sheldon Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
penny Gummy bears? Thank you.
sheldon Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party.
penny Not a chance.
sheldon All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.
leonard Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once.
penny All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship.
sheldon Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?
penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
sheldon When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
sheldon All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.
penny What’s that?
sheldon I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
amy Good morning.
sheldon Hello.
amy I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth.
sheldon All right.
amy You sure you’re okay with this?
sheldon Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
amy Thank you. That means a lot to me.
sheldon Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.
amy Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?
sheldon Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying.
amy You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
sheldon Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry.
raj Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.
leonard You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
raj Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.
sheldon Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
leonard Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
sheldon Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
howard Hey, guys, I got a surprise.
leonard Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.
howard No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.
raj What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
howard I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now.
sheldon Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
leonard Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny. I was wrong, it’s still funny.
sheldon Oh, good. Hah-hah!
penny Amy, what’s wrong?
amy My boyfriend’s a jerk.
penny Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?
amy I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?
penny Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
amy The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
penny I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
amy Oh, that’s good.
penny Mm.
amy I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
penny Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all.
amy Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper.
penny Yes. On purpose.
amy He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.
penny Well, sickly is the new sexy.
amy Yeah.
penny Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.
amy Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
penny That’s hilarious. No.
bernadette Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
sheldon Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go.
bernadette Pew!
leonard Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
raj Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff.
leonard All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot.
bernadette Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match.
howard But I worked hard to get this armour.
bernadette Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple.
howard Fine, I’ll change.
sheldon Hah-hah!
amy I don’t think I want to play a game.
penny Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…
amy Like that?
penny Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
amy Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.
penny Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on.
amy That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
penny Wars.
amy What?
penny Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
amy What’s the difference?
penny There’s absolutely no difference.
amy How do I get him to treat me better?
penny All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment.
amy No, he loves that.
penny Hmm.
amy Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
penny All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.
amy I don’t think I’d be good at that.
penny That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s.
raj Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.
bernadette I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
sheldon That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
amy Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends.
penny Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
amy I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.
penny Ooh, burn!
amy And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.
sheldon Armin who?
amy Armin… damn it.
penny Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.
amy You’re hurting me.
penny No, Sheldon hurt you.
amy Before; now it’s you.
penny Oh.
sheldon I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
penny Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…
amy Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go.
sheldon Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. Oh, grow up, Leonard.
raj But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
penny And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go.
amy What about the Science Center?
penny I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
amy Rain check.
bernadette I’m gonna go, too.
howard I’ll miss you.
bernadette I’ll miss you.
howard I’ll miss you more.
bernadette No, I’ll…
raj Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.
all Hear! Hear!
raj I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
mrs_wolowitz Howard Joel Wolowitz! I’ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I’ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!
howard That’s my ride, got to go.
