howard So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.
raj I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.
howard Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.
leonard You’re kidding.
raj Why?
howard He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.
leonard That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.
howard You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
raj Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out.
leonard Yeah, he worships Hawking.
howard I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
raj That’s really nice of you, Howard.
howard Hm, it’s no big deal.
leonard Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
sheldon Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?
leonard Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
sheldon Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.
leonard Really?
raj That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.
sheldon Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.
howard Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.
sheldon Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it.
raj Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
howard Yep.
leonard Still going to introduce him?
howard Not on your life.
sheldon Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.
howard I told you, no.
sheldon But I said I’m sorry.
howard No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?
sheldon And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
howard Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?
sheldon Um, to go to Jewish heaven?
howard Jews don’t have heaven.
sheldon Then to avoid Jewish hell?
howard Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
sheldon Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.
howard Oh, you can’t be serious.
sheldon Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.
howard Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
sheldon Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.
howard Get out of my lab.
sheldon Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?
howard Get out.
sheldon How about dolphins?
howard Out!
leonard So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?
howard It was great. We talked about movies.
sheldon Oh!
howard I showed him some card tricks.
sheldon Oh!
howard He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
sheldon Oh!
howard Something got you down there, bunky?
sheldon Howard, please, I’m begging you.
leonard Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
raj Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.
sheldon Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.
howard You’re kidding.
sheldon No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.
howard You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.
sheldon It’s actually 01100111.
howard No!
sheldon I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking.
howard Let me try gansta, hells no.
sheldon Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me.
leonard What if he doesn’t?
sheldon He will, he’s really smart.
howard That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
sheldon How do I do that?
howard You walk away.
sheldon Walking away.
leonard You do realize you own his ass right now.
howard I do.
raj You can make him do anything you want.
howard Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.
raj Well, don’t be too mean.
sheldon Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.
raj I wouldn’t mind a glass.
sheldon I wasn’t talking to you.
raj Bring him to his bony knees.
howard Sheldon, come on back.
sheldon Yes, yes. What did you decide?
howard I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
sheldon Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific.
howard But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me.
sheldon What kinds of things?
howard Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
sheldon Of course.
howard You should be so lucky.
sheldon All right. What would you like me to do first?
howard Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.
sheldon Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
howard That’s nice.
sheldon That’s a lot of belt buckles.
howard Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back.
sheldon You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.
howard Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.
howard Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?
sheldon Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.
howard Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
sheldon My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
howard Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.
sheldon And you want me to return it for you?
howard No, no, no, mon petit cherie.
sheldon What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
penny Hey.
sheldon Hello.
penny It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
sheldon This is not my laundry.
penny Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her.
sheldon Those are Howard’s.
penny Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
sheldon Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist.
penny Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.
sheldon That’s close enough.
penny I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?
sheldon Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?
penny Well…
sheldon Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…
penny I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
sheldon Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.
penny Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
sheldon Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
penny See, there it is, there’s that twinkle.
sheldon Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.
penny What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?
sheldon I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
penny Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
sheldon I knew it.
howard What’s the matter?
bernadette Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.
howard It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.
bernadette Oh, my God, that’s terrible.
howard Hey, I gave you first crack at it.
bernadette Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.
howard He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
bernadette If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great.
howard Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.
bernadette It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
howard Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.
bernadette No, you have to stop now.
mrs_wolowitz Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!
bernadette Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him.
mrs_wolowitz Sheldon! I need your help!
sheldon What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?
mrs_wolowitz It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!
sheldon What do you want me to do?
mrs_wolowitz We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.
sheldon I’m not sure how to do this.
mrs_wolowitz It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag.
sheldon Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay.
mrs_wolowitz Now zip me up.
sheldon Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.
mrs_wolowitz You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?
sheldon Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!
howard Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.
leonard What are these?
howard Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?
raj Wow, that’s amazing.
howard Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.
sheldon I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.
howard I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
sheldon Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
howard I don’t know.
sheldon Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.
howard All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one.
sheldon Okay.
howard Give me a compliment.
sheldon Fine. You have very tiny hands.
howard No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do.
sheldon You’re obviously good at what you do.
howard Well, then why are you always ripping on me?
sheldon Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing.
leonard It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.
howard Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
howard Sorry, I can’t.
sheldon What, why not?
howard I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
sheldon All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.
raj I thought he might be a little more excited.
leonard Give it a second.
sheldon Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.
hawking I know.
sheldon I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
hawking My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.
sheldon I know.
hawking Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
sheldon Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.
hawking That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong.
sheldon What do you mean wrong?
hawking You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.
sheldon No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.
hawking Are you saying I do?
sheldon Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.
hawking Great, another fainter.
