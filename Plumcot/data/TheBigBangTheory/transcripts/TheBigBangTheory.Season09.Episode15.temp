raj Hey.
howard Hello.
sheldon If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.
leonard Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.
howard Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.
sheldon Not a clue. Raj?
raj Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
leonard You don’t sound very excited about it.
raj Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
howard Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
raj You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?
howard You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?
leonard Yeah, just get it over with.
raj Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
howard No.
leonard Not really.
sheldon You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.
penny So, you really gonna break up with her?
raj Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
penny Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?
leonard I stopped counting at four.
penny All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.
raj Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
leonard She meant Emily.
penny No, I, I really didn’t.
emily You’re seriously breaking up with me?
raj Yeah.
emily And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?
raj You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days.
raj Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?
claire Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.
raj But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
claire Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass.
raj Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
raj I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.
leonard Well, you were right, tears.
amy Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.
sheldon I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.
amy People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around.
sheldon Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.
amy What do you mean?
sheldon Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.
amy Oh. That is so sweet.
sheldon So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
amy Catchy.
howard I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
bernadette Don’t make it too hot.
howard Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.
bernadette Look at that, you shaved it all.
howard You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?
bernadette Ew, really? Get it out.
howard How?
bernadette Uh, wish we had a skimmer.
howard Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.
bernadette I don’t know how to turn off the jets.
howard Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer.
leonard Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.
penny An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
leonard I know.
penny So what did you say?
leonard Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.
penny All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?
leonard Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?
penny Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
leonard A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
penny Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?
leonard I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
maitre_d I’m afraid so.
leonard Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
maitre_d Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?
man I did.
leonard Oh, I took care of it.
amy Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live.
sheldon Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…
amy And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
together Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
amy Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers.
sheldon It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.
amy Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
sheldon Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.
amy No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?
raj What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
amy Rajesh?
raj Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?
amy I, I think it starts with good communication.
sheldon You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.
howard I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much.
bernadette I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.
howard Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?
bernadette No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.
howard Well, how do we do that?
bernadette Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.
howard Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check.
bernadette Anything else?
howard To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.
penny This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.
leonard What are you gonna say?
penny I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.
leonard I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.
penny I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
leonard See if you can get a table by the window.
penny Hi there. What’s your name?
maitre_d Glen.
penny Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?
maitre_d Well, you know, Valentine’s Day.
penny Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…
maitre_d With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.
penny You don’t have to call me ma’am.
maitre_d Okay.
penny I mean, we’re basically the same age.
maitre_d Okay.
penny How old are you?
maitre_d I’m 21. How old are you?
penny Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here.
leonard What? Why?
penny Because I’m young. Let’s go.
amy Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.
raj You really think so?
sheldon Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.
amy Your friend is hurting.
raj No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
sheldon I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.
amy Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
barry Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.
raj Kripke? Is that you?
barry Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.
sheldon Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.
barry Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?
sheldon I don’t see why not.
bernadette He’s eating. That’s a good sign.
howard You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
bernadette He’s pretty cute.
howard He is. Should we name him?
bernadette It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?
howard Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.
bernadette Are you okay?
howard No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.
bernadette Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?
howard Poor judgement, obviously.
bernadette He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.
howard How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
leonard It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?
penny It is freaking amazing.
leonard Well, glad you’re feeling better.
penny I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.
leonard Is that a big deal?
penny Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
leonard Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…
penny Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?
leonard Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.
penny Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.
leonard No, they’re not.
penny You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
leonard Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.
penny Won’t make us any younger.
leonard Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.
penny Okay, like what?
leonard I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.
amy Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.
sheldon Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.
raj But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?
amy Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.
sheldon And actually, it was three different men.
barry Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?
amy Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
barry No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here.
amy Now?
barry Yup.
amy Now?
barry Yup.
amy Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
raj Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again.
sheldon Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.
amy I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…
raj Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents.
amy …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
barry Hey, I think I got cut off.
amy Hello, Kripke.
barry I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?
leonard Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.
leonard Are you actually gonna dance?
leonard Of course.
penny Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?
leonard No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.
penny Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
leonard That sounds fun. When’s it start?
penny Midnight.
leonard Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.
penny Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.
leonard Oh, thank God.
penny Yes.
howard It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.
bernadette Oh, terrific.
howard It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me.
bernadette If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested.
howard Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.
bernadette Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is.
howard He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
bernadette Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
howard No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
bernadette We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant.
raj I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much.
amy It really can.
sheldon All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
raj I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
amy No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
sheldon Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us.
barry Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.
amy I’m just gonna push all the buttons.
sheldon Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it.
amy Really?
sheldon Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
amy So do I.
sheldon When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…
leonard_and_penny Happy Valentine’s Day!
leonard We are young and fun.
sheldon I stand corrected. Fun.
sheldon Congratulations on a successful live show.
amy And a lovely Valentine’s Day.
penny Cleaning up is not young and fun.
leonard It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
sheldon Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
amy Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
sheldon I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.
