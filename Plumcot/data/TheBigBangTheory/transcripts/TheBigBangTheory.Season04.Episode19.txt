sheldon_cooper Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?
officer_shin Here. Breathe into this bag.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper They stole everything, Leonard, everything.
officer_shin Are you the roommate?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?
officer_shin Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, what did they get?
sheldon_cooper What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.
leonard_hofstadter You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
sheldon_cooper What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.
officer_shin Into the bag.
sheldon_cooper They took my battle ostrich.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, not Glenn?
sheldon_cooper Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.
officer_shin Good luck, fellas.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, officer.
sheldon_cooper Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?
officer_shin Mr. Cooper, there’s nothing…
sheldon_cooper Doctor Cooper.
officer_shin Seriously?
leonard_hofstadter Not the kind with access to drugs.
officer_shin Fine. Dr. Cooper. I’m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn’t have jurisdiction in Pandora.
sheldon_cooper That’s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?
officer_shin What?
sheldon_cooper You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?
officer_shin No.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, officer.
sheldon_cooper It’s all gone. All gone.
leonard_hofstadter I’m really sorry, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.
leonard_hofstadter I’m on it. Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.
sheldon_cooper See if Raj is done with Pilates.
sheldon_cooper Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.
howard_wolowitz Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint.
sheldon_cooper Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
raj_koothrappali Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things.
sheldon_cooper Can we trust him?
raj_koothrappali I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.
howard_wolowitz Whoa! Somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
sheldon_cooper No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope.
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.
penny Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.
sheldon_cooper That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game.
raj_koothrappali Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.
penny Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!
sheldon_cooper Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
penny Just say thank you.
sheldon_cooper I thought I just did.
penny All right. See you later.
priya_koothrappali Oh! Hello.
penny Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place.
priya_koothrappali I don’t know what that means.
penny Yeah, well, sadly, I do.
penny Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
bernadette_rostenkowski I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information.
penny I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.
bernadette_rostenkowski I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
penny So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler I think you’re on.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. That bitch!
penny Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
amy_farrah_fowler Ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.
penny You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m drunk.
penny You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again.
penny No, don’t do that. No reason to be mean to her.
amy_farrah_fowler This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?
penny No, but I can name all the Kardashians.
amy_farrah_fowler Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
amy_farrah_fowler Believe me, it’s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I’ll show you.
howard_wolowitz All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.
raj_koothrappali I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
howard_wolowitz Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, what exactly are we looking for?
howard_wolowitz Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy.
priya_koothrappali Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.
priya_koothrappali Seriously?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun.
priya_koothrappali Maybe I should just go home.
howard_wolowitz Our troll just walked in! I got him!
leonard_hofstadter We got him. We’re almost done.
howard_wolowitz So, how do you guys want to play this?
sheldon_cooper Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.
sheldon_cooper I don’t care! I’m losin’ it, man!
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.
priya_koothrappali Oh, dear Lord.
howard_wolowitz Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I’ll have sex with him.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not where it was going.
raj_koothrappali Good, because I would hate that.
priya_koothrappali Leonard, you’re busy, let’s talk tomorrow.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?
priya_koothrappali No, no, I think it’s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man’s body.
leonard_hofstadter Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens.
sheldon_cooper And people think I don’t get sarcasm.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, well, well. Look who it is.
penny Okay, be nice.
priya_koothrappali Hello.
penny Hi. We’re just heading out for a drink.
amy_farrah_fowler Because I do that now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.
priya_koothrappali What?
penny Don’t listen to her, she’s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?
priya_koothrappali Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.
amy_farrah_fowler Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?
leonard_hofstadter Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
raj_koothrappali Oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?
raj_koothrappali There’s no reason to worry.
leonard_hofstadter That’s a relief.
raj_koothrappali I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
howard_wolowitz Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.
sheldon_cooper What?
leonard_hofstadter Really?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.
sheldon_cooper I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!
howard_wolowitz Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.
sheldon_cooper The name and the address drip with evil.
raj_koothrappali What else do we know about him?
howard_wolowitz Well, quite a bit, actually.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
howard_wolowitz Yes, he does live with his parents. Here’s a Google Earth shot of their house.
sheldon_cooper Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
leonard_hofstadter Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?
sheldon_cooper Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.
leonard_hofstadter No one’s getting tortured.
sheldon_cooper Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?
raj_koothrappali I totally had one of those.
sheldon_cooper Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?
raj_koothrappali I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?
sheldon_cooper Sure.
howard_wolowitz Also, tonight’s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and
sheldon_cooper Fine. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.
leonard_hofstadter Aw, screw it. I’m in.
raj_koothrappali Me, too.
howard_wolowitz And me.
sheldon_cooper One moment. I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.
howard_wolowitz I am. She’s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N’s, one V.
debbie_wolowitz Fanny pack of wolves.
leonard_hofstadter That’s incredible.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, she’s kind of a Wheel savant.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-oh, that’s Priya.
raj_koothrappali Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.
leonard_hofstadter Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.
raj_koothrappali Very nice. You lie to my sister.
howard_wolowitz That’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.
raj_koothrappali Oh, guess who.
leonard_hofstadter Cover for me.
raj_koothrappali Hello, Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.
howard_wolowitz New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D’s, three O’s.
debbie_wolowitz Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
sheldon_cooper That’s uncanny.
howard_wolowitz I know. It’s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?
leonard_hofstadter Totally.
raj_koothrappali Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?
sheldon_cooper Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, we’re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.
sheldon_cooper I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?
raj_koothrappali I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
sheldon_cooper This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
raj_koothrappali It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
howard_wolowitz Beyonce? Really?
raj_koothrappali She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, I’m feeling it.
sheldon_cooper We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
howard_wolowitz Next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train.
sheldon_cooper I always prefer the train.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Coming.
howard_wolowitz Why did you bring that?
sheldon_cooper No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody.
sheldon_cooper So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Well, now I just feel silly holding it.
leonard_hofstadter Come on.
sheldon_cooper Can I at least kick down the door?
leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.
voice_inside#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode19 Who is it?
sheldon_cooper Your doom!
raj_koothrappali Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
sheldon_cooper Good point. Basket of puppies.
huge_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode19 What?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Are you Todd Zarnecki?
todd_zarnecki Yeah. Who are you?
sheldon_cooper I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
todd_zarnecki I don’t think so. Let me see that.
sheldon_cooper Careful. That’s a collectible.
todd_zarnecki I know. I’ve always wanted one.
sheldon_cooper Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought.
sheldon_cooper You know, the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, he walked right into our trap.
raj_koothrappali Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
leonard_hofstadter Oh-oh.
raj_koothrappali What’s the matter?
leonard_hofstadter Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?
sheldon_cooper Of course.
raj_koothrappali Very basic.
howard_wolowitz 19th-century technology.
leonard_hofstadter Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz No, not a clue.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up.
sheldon_cooper It’d be swell if they had a train.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Penny.
penny No problem. So, Leonard, I think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I kind of told her I was working.
penny So you lied to her. Also interesting.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.
penny Well, doesn’t matter if she gets it, as long as she’s pretty.
howard_wolowitz This one’s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn’t make it work with her?
penny So did you at least get Sheldon’s fake stuff back?
sheldon_cooper No. We failed in our noble quest.
penny How come?
sheldon_cooper Todd Zarnecki was mean.
penny All right. Hang on.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
penny I’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. This ain’t no Beyonce.
todd_zarnecki Now what?
penny Give my friend his stuff back.
todd_zarnecki I don’t know what you’re talking about.
penny Well, then, good news. Today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place. Now give him his stuff back.
todd_zarnecki Okay.
sheldon_cooper We did it! I said, we.
priya_koothrappali Oh, hold the door.
penny Oh, hi.
priya_koothrappali Hi.
penny Going to see Leonard?
priya_koothrappali Yes. How have you been?
penny Fine. You?
priya_koothrappali Very well, thank you.
penny Alright, well great seeing you.
priya_koothrappali Yeah, you too.
penny Amy’s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
