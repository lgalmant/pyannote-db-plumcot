sheldon Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
amy And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
sheldon And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
both Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags.
sheldon Hit it.
howard For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
raj What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.
together Fun with flags, fun with flags.
howard Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.
together Fun with flags.
amy As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.
sheldon Who haven’t learned their place yet.
amy We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
sheldon Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.
amy So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.
sheldon So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.
amy Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…
penny I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?
leonard It’s cute, they’re having fun living together.
penny Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.
bernadette Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.
leonard What do you mean?
bernadette Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.
leonard So, she’s just been lying to him?
penny Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon.
leonard Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.
sheldon Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
howard Oh, right.
sheldon Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.
howard Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny.
raj We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
amy It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
sheldon Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
amy Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone.
sheldon So?
amy Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
sheldon I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
amy Anyway, how about dinner?
sheldon You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.
amy Thanks, but you don’t have to.
sheldon Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.
amy Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?
sheldon Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?
amy No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?
sheldon I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.
howard I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.
leonard So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
raj If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?
leonard You’re awful quiet, everything okay?
sheldon I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.
howard Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?
sheldon Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.
leonard I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
sheldon Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
howard You heard him, guys, don’t ask.
sheldon Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.
leonard Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
sheldon I don’t understand.
leonard She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
sheldon So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
raj Oh my God, that’s who you look like.
leonard Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.
raj Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
howard And how single are you right now?
raj Eating cake on the toilet single.
sheldon Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.
howard Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.
leonard Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
howard So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?
leonard Well, of course not.
howard So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?
leonard Uh, no.
howard I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
leonard Are you kidding me?
howard See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.
leonard Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.
sheldon Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
leonard I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month.
sheldon It’s khoo-vakh.
leonard Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
sheldon No, no, he’s over there.
leonard Oh, yeah, there he is.
penny So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?
amy Um, it was a drywall problem.
penny Oh, no, what happened?
amy Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…
penny Wet wall?
amy Or damp wall, just as bad.
penny Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
amy Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…
penny Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.
amy I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.
penny But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
amy Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.
penny Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.
amy Thanks.
penny The woman at the wall store?
amy Let it go.
sheldon Are you going to confront Penny?
leonard Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
sheldon Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
leonard Oh, my God, I’m going blind.
penny Hi.
amy Food’s here.
sheldon Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?
amy Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.
sheldon Interesting. Very interesting.
penny Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.
sheldon Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?
penny I did, still a mess.
sheldon Leonard?
leonard Yeah?
sheldon jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny?
leonard jISovbe’
amy Why are you speaking Klingon?
sheldon Why are you speaking English?
amy This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?
penny Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
amy Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
penny Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble.
sheldon Oh, wait, stop that.
amy You stop that.
sheldon Dayaj’a’
leonard ghobe’
sheldon Qu’vatlh
penny Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
leonard Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.
amy Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
sheldon How could you lie to me?
penny Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.
leonard Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?
penny What? Tha… That is not true.
leonard Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.
penny Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
leonard You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
penny Uh, did you notice your key chain?
leonard Where’s Batman?
bernadette Hey.
penny Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
bernadette One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
howard It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv
amy Everybody stop it with that.
raj I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.
amy And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
howard You’re up, blabby.
bernadette Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.
amy I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.
sheldon It’s all right.
leonard And?
penny And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
raj Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?
sheldon Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.
amy Are you saying you’d like to live with me?
sheldon I’m open to the possibility.
penny Ubamy bube cubool.
amy Whatever.
howard You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.
penny That’s a great idea.
leonard Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
raj That would be amazing.
sheldon Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room.
leonard But you won’t be living here.
sheldon But that’s my room.
leonard But you won’t be living here.
sheldon But that’s my room.
leonard You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.
penny Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
sheldon But that’s my room.
everyone But you won’t be living here.
amy Thank you for understanding.
sheldon Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.
amy Good night.
sheldon Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?
amy I don’t know. It, it could be.
sheldon Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.
amy Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.
sheldon I hate your apartment.
amy Sorry, you brought it up?
sheldon Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.
amy It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
sheldon But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
amy Yes.
sheldon I’m not a child, don’t do that.
amy Sorry.
leonard Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.
penny Thank you.
leonard Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
penny Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.
leonard I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
penny Do you really mean that?
leonard I really do.
penny Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.
leonard Yeah? What are you keeping?
penny That candle and you.
leonard What about my robot poster?
penny Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.
amy What’s going on?
sheldon I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
amy Can it be more of an internal struggle?
sheldon I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.
amy How about if I just don’t breathe at all?
sheldon That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
leonard Oh, hey, Sheldon.
penny We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
sheldon No.
amy What is happening?
howard Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?
sheldon Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
raj We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.
sheldon Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?
leonard Over my assless chaps you will.
howard This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?
sheldon Yes.
raj Do you like living with her?
sheldon Yes.
leonard Do you know what you need to do now?
sheldon Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.
amy Hi.
sheldon Hello.
amy What are you doing?
sheldon I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
amy I understand. I’ll leave you be.
sheldon What, you’re familiar with the reference?
amy Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
sheldon Exactly.
amy Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.
sheldon Thank you.
amy You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
sheldon Really?
amy Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.
sheldon Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
amy Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.
sheldon Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.
penny Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
leonard Wow.
penny I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
leonard No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.
penny Oh, that means so much. I love you.
leonard I love you, too.
leonard Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny.
