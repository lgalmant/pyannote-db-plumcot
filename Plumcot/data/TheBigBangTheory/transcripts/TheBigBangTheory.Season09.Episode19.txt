amy_farrah_fowler I didn’t understand your e-mail.
sheldon_cooper Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.
amy_farrah_fowler I didn’t understand your e-mail.
sheldon_cooper Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.
amy_farrah_fowler Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?
sheldon_cooper So, is that a yes?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date.
sheldon_cooper Oh, but I like this computer.
amy_farrah_fowler The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.
amy_farrah_fowler The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
sheldon_cooper The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.
amy_farrah_fowler Get a new computer.
sheldon_cooper What?
amy_farrah_fowler Get a new computer.
sheldon_cooper What? Hello?
leonard_hofstadter This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?
howard_wolowitz Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.
leonard_hofstadter If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set.
penny Hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. What are you doing here?
bernadette_rostenkowski We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
penny Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.
leonard_hofstadter Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.
penny So, how’s it goin’?
leonard_hofstadter Good. Slow.
howard_wolowitz There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.
penny Is there anything we can do to help?
leonard_hofstadter You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.
penny Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
bernadette_rostenkowski Can we really help?
howard_wolowitz While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll show you how to do one.
penny Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.
amy_farrah_fowler I got here as quickly as I could.
sheldon_cooper You’re too late.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this is silly.
sheldon_cooper You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
amy_farrah_fowler That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
sheldon_cooper Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.
sheldon_cooper How could you do that?
amy_farrah_fowler Do what?
sheldon_cooper Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.
sheldon_cooper Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.
leonard_hofstadter After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.
penny Like this?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, perfect.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
leonard_hofstadter We had a full spool yesterday.
howard_wolowitz What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.
penny How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
leonard_hofstadter Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…
penny Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.
howard_wolowitz You want to come with us?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m kind of getting into the groove here.
penny Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.
penny Okay, so what is solder?
sheldon_cooper I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?
amy_farrah_fowler Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
sheldon_cooper You wouldn’t.
amy_farrah_fowler Whatch me.
sheldon_cooper Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.
amy_farrah_fowler I thought you might like it.
sheldon_cooper Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs.
amy_farrah_fowler Or you could just look into my eyes.
sheldon_cooper But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.
sheldon_cooper Oh. I am.
amy_farrah_fowler And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, but he said you can get store credit.
sheldon_cooper Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit.
amy_farrah_fowler But why wouldn’t…
sheldon_cooper Can we please change the subject?
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?
sheldon_cooper I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, just tell me.
sheldon_cooper It might be easier to show you.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
sheldon_cooper We’d have to take your car.
amy_farrah_fowler All right.
sheldon_cooper And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?
leonard_hofstadter Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
howard_wolowitz Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
leonard_hofstadter I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Sorry, we can’t.
howard_wolowitz Well, hang on. What movie is it?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.
howard_wolowitz Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.
leonard_hofstadter What about the girls?
howard_wolowitz Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.
penny I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.
bernadette_rostenkowski It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.
raj_koothrappali Hey. Where are the guys?
penny Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.
bernadette_rostenkowski Since when do you work on weekends?
raj_koothrappali I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.
penny You were home alone and had no one to play with?
raj_koothrappali Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not with Lightning McQueen here.
penny I think we’re good.
raj_koothrappali Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.
bernadette_rostenkowski I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Will you please tell me where we’re going?
sheldon_cooper Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m driving the car. I need to know.
sheldon_cooper Right.
amy_farrah_fowler So where are we going?
sheldon_cooper No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.
leonard_hofstadter What are we gonna tell the girls?
howard_wolowitz It’s not a problem.
leonard_hofstadter I mean without lying.
howard_wolowitz And now you’ve made it a problem.
leonard_hofstadter Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
penny Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.
leonard_hofstadter They bought it.
howard_wolowitz But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you’re good at this.
howard_wolowitz Well, I lie a lot.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you were right.
howard_wolowitz Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.
leonard_hofstadter Who are you texting?
howard_wolowitz Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
leonard_hofstadter He’ll never make it in time.
howard_wolowitz I know. I want to make him feel bad.
leonard_hofstadter Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
penny Why?
raj_koothrappali I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s going on?
raj_koothrappali Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
penny Un-freakin’ believable.
bernadette_rostenkowski Son of a bitch.
raj_koothrappali Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.
penny No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.
penny Mm-hmm.
raj_koothrappali Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.
amy_farrah_fowler Why do you have a storage unit?
sheldon_cooper Just wait.
amy_farrah_fowler How long have you had it?
sheldon_cooper Just wait.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you want me to hold that computer?
sheldon_cooper Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?
sheldon_cooper It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.
amy_farrah_fowler All of it?
sheldon_cooper I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.
penny All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?
raj_koothrappali I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
penny Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?
raj_koothrappali No, ma’am.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.
penny Yeah, that’s pretty good.
raj_koothrappali I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.
sheldon_cooper In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.
amy_farrah_fowler You have sporting equipment?
sheldon_cooper Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?
sheldon_cooper I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.
amy_farrah_fowler So, why do you feel you need to save these things?
sheldon_cooper I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I get it. I get it.
sheldon_cooper It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t.
sheldon_cooper Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.
amy_farrah_fowler Why?
sheldon_cooper Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.
sheldon_cooper Like what?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?
sheldon_cooper I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not a contest.
penny Okay, here they come.
bernadette_rostenkowski Go hide.
raj_koothrappali Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
penny Hey, what’s this?
leonard_hofstadter Listen, we did a stupid thing.
howard_wolowitz We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.
leonard_hofstadter So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Anywhere you want.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.
penny Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.
raj_koothrappali Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them.
howard_wolowitz What is he doing in there?
raj_koothrappali Busting you.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay. They apologized.
penny Yeah, it’s fine.
raj_koothrappali Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
howard_wolowitz You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
raj_koothrappali No spoilers. No spoilers.
penny And he’s back in the closet.
howard_wolowitz Ready for dinner?
penny Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Should we invite Raj?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler So, no one else knows about this?
sheldon_cooper Only you.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you for trusting me.
sheldon_cooper What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
amy_farrah_fowler That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.
amy_farrah_fowler Baby steps, I guess.
sheldon_cooper I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Okay.
sheldon_cooper I will always have the dent to remember it by.
amy_farrah_fowler You did it. Do you feel okay?
sheldon_cooper Actually, yes. I do.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m proud of you.
sheldon_cooper Thanks.
sheldon_cooper I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I feel closer to you now.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.
amy_farrah_fowler What did you have in mind?
sheldon_cooper You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.
amy_farrah_fowler I really had to go home for this?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room.
amy_farrah_fowler And yet, I’m not.
sheldon_cooper But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
amy_farrah_fowler And yet, you can’t.
sheldon_cooper I know.
