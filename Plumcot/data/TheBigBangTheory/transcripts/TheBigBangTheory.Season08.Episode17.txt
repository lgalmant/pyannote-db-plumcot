leonard_hofstadter I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.
penny Again, it was miniature golf.
leonard_hofstadter Admit it, you’re a little turned on.
penny You can’t be this proud.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
penny Because I beat you.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hi.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. You’re back.
amy_farrah_fowler We have some exciting news.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
penny Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper Do you want to say it?
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s say it together.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 We’re getting a turtle.
penny This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.
penny Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
sheldon_cooper No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
leonard_hofstadter Why a turtle?
sheldon_cooper After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.
amy_farrah_fowler For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.
leonard_hofstadter Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
penny Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s what I said.
raj_koothrappali So, where’s your roommate tonight?
emily_sweeney Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.
raj_koothrappali But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.
emily_sweeney And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.
raj_koothrappali That’s okay. I can come back later.
emily_sweeney No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.
raj_koothrappali Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.
emily_sweeney Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.
raj_koothrappali Oh, good.
emily_sweeney Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.
sheldon_cooper That was a lot of puppies.
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.
sheldon_cooper I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.
amy_farrah_fowler But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.
sheldon_cooper Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
amy_farrah_fowler You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?
sheldon_cooper Would you have approved?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course not.
sheldon_cooper Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.
penny Aw, is this your first time?
leonard_hofstadter No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
penny Well, why?
leonard_hofstadter Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.
penny You went to the dirty store without me?
leonard_hofstadter In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
penny Well, get it. Get it for me.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.
penny Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?
leonard_hofstadter No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
penny Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.
leonard_hofstadter You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
penny No. No, come on, I want to do it.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
penny Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.
howard_wolowitz How are the taxes going?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
howard_wolowitz Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
bernadette_rostenkowski A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
howard_wolowitz Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. Hey, what’s up?
raj_koothrappali Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?
howard_wolowitz Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
raj_koothrappali What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?
howard_wolowitz She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.
raj_koothrappali So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong?
raj_koothrappali I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
howard_wolowitz So?
raj_koothrappali She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
howard_wolowitz Why were you looking in it?
raj_koothrappali Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
howard_wolowitz Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.
raj_koothrappali Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.
howard_wolowitz You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.
raj_koothrappali Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s happening?
howard_wolowitz Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw. I’m gonna miss her.
penny So what do you think?
leonard_hofstadter I thought it’d be a little more, just more.
penny I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
penny Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?
penny Almost 1am.
leonard_hofstadter Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.
penny Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
amy_farrah_fowler No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
sheldon_cooper I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
sheldon_cooper Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
sheldon_cooper So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
amy_farrah_fowler I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
sheldon_cooper Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.
amy_farrah_fowler And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.
sheldon_cooper First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
amy_farrah_fowler No. Forget it.
sheldon_cooper What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
amy_farrah_fowler Please don’t.
sheldon_cooper Yep, you’re mad.
howard_wolowitz Okay, let me see the damage.
raj_koothrappali Hang on.
howard_wolowitz Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.
raj_koothrappali With what?
howard_wolowitz Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
raj_koothrappali She does.
howard_wolowitz Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
raj_koothrappali Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
sheldon_cooper I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.
amy_farrah_fowler Why do you even want to do this?
sheldon_cooper Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
amy_farrah_fowler Can’t you just tell me?
sheldon_cooper But I made a video.
sheldon_cooper I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
leonard_hofstadter You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Open it and check.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
sheldon_cooper But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
sheldon_cooper Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.
leonard_hofstadter Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.
penny How did you get paint in your eye?
leonard_hofstadter Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
raj_koothrappali This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.
howard_wolowitz It’s fine. You just need two more nails.
raj_koothrappali Okay, where should I put them?
howard_wolowitz In Emily’s eyes.
raj_koothrappali You’re not helping.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.
raj_koothrappali You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…
emily_sweeney Raj? I’m back.
raj_koothrappali Oh, no. Hey.
emily_sweeney Hi.
raj_koothrappali How was the hospital?
emily_sweeney Fine. What were you doing in there?
raj_koothrappali Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
emily_sweeney You were looking in my night stand?
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
emily_sweeney So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?
raj_koothrappali You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
emily_sweeney No.
raj_koothrappali Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.
emily_sweeney I can’t believe you don’t trust me.
bernadette_rostenkowski She sounds really mad.
howard_wolowitz We should hang up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we should.
howard_wolowitz But we’re not going to, are we?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not a chance.
howard_wolowitz What happened to snooping is wrong?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?
leonard_hofstadter Well, we did it.
penny We sure did.
leonard_hofstadter I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.
penny Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.
leonard_hofstadter So, where do we want to hang it?
penny What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.
leonard_hofstadter But it’s an expression of our love.
penny And our butts. Not hanging it.
leonard_hofstadter Seems a shame to throw it away.
penny Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.
leonard_hofstadter God, I love you. I love you so much.
amy_farrah_fowler I think I’m gonna go home.
sheldon_cooper Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.
amy_farrah_fowler Sure. Unless something better comes along.
sheldon_cooper Do you want me to withdraw my application?
amy_farrah_fowler What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
sheldon_cooper And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re on the same planet.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
amy_farrah_fowler Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
sheldon_cooper I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?
amy_farrah_fowler You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.
sheldon_cooper You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?
amy_farrah_fowler Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.
sheldon_cooper They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
amy_farrah_fowler I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.
sheldon_cooper Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.
raj_koothrappali Thank you for forgiving me.
emily_sweeney That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.
raj_koothrappali Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.
emily_sweeney Can I ask you one thing?
raj_koothrappali Of course. What?
emily_sweeney Did you look in my closet?
raj_koothrappali No. Just the drawer.
emily_sweeney You promise you didn’t look in the closet?
raj_koothrappali I promise. Why, what’s in there?
emily_sweeney Don’t worry about it. Good night.
