sheldon_cooper And here’s another interesting weather fact.
penny Another? Great.
sheldon_cooper Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.
penny Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
sheldon_cooper Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
penny You know, I will miss this.
sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.
penny I won’t.
sheldon_cooper That criticism will come later in your report card.
penny Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card.
leonard_hofstadter Hello.
penny Leonard! Hi!
leonard_hofstadter Keep your voice down.
penny Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.
leonard_hofstadter We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.
penny Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.
penny Oh, that is so romantic.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure, that’s why I did it.
penny Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.
sheldon_cooper Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.
sheldon_cooper Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.
stuart_bloom Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.
stuart_bloom Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
sheldon_cooper Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector.
sheldon_cooper I’m a real collector. How rare is it?
stuart_bloom Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
sheldon_cooper Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.
howard_wolowitz What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?
raj_koothrappali Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.
raj_koothrappali Hey, what’s your problem?
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on.
raj_koothrappali Why are you on a diet?
howard_wolowitz I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.
raj_koothrappali Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
sheldon_cooper Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.
stuart_bloom All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this.
sheldon_cooper Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.
stuart_bloom Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare.
sheldon_cooper Oh.
leonard_hofstadter And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.
penny Ah.
leonard_hofstadter And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.
penny Oh. Oh, that’s the pizza.
leonard_hofstadter Yep. Here’s some money.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
penny Hey.
pizza_delivery_guy Twenty-two fifty.
penny Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.
pizza_delivery_guy Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.
penny Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.
penny That’s nice.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
penny Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.
penny Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. Have a good night!
sheldon_cooper What, now, do you have company?
penny No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
sheldon_cooper Oh, I can take a look at it.
penny Well…
sheldon_cooper I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.
penny Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom.
sheldon_cooper That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?
penny Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.
sheldon_cooper Of course. Ask a silly question.
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper That’s odd.
penny Um, what?
sheldon_cooper There are takeout containers in the trash can.
penny So? That’s my dinner from last night.
sheldon_cooper What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
penny Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.
sheldon_cooper Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, honey.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski I made some brownies. You want one?
howard_wolowitz You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.
bernadette_rostenkowski We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat.
howard_wolowitz Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?
howard_wolowitz Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why can’t she do it?
howard_wolowitz ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?
bernadette_rostenkowski This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.
howard_wolowitz Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
howard_wolowitz You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.
howard_wolowitz Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
howard_wolowitz I feel so stupid. And fat.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?
howard_wolowitz Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I am.
amy_farrah_fowler Then what does tweepadock mean?
sheldon_cooper Uh, elephant?
amy_farrah_fowler Lucky guess.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.
amy_farrah_fowler What happened?
sheldon_cooper I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
sheldon_cooper She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re being ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.
amy_farrah_fowler Poor Leonard.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you hear anything?
sheldon_cooper I hear a woman’s voice.
amy_farrah_fowler Is it Penny?
sheldon_cooper No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.
sheldon_cooper There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.
amy_farrah_fowler Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act.
amy_farrah_fowler No, Sheldon, don’t.
sheldon_cooper Aha.
penny What the hell?
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
penny Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.
sheldon_cooper Right. Penny. Penny. Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.
leonard_hofstadter That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.
penny No, he doesn’t.
leonard_hofstadter I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
sheldon_cooper Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.
leonard_hofstadter The what?
sheldon_cooper Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler Please leave me out of this.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, I said I was sorry.
sheldon_cooper No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.
penny It was fine.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?
sheldon_cooper You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello, sailor.
penny Ooh, now we’re talking.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
howard_wolowitz Thanks for coming over.
raj_koothrappali No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven.
raj_koothrappali Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?
raj_koothrappali Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.
raj_koothrappali I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.
howard_wolowitz Seriously?
raj_koothrappali Do you want my help or not?
howard_wolowitz Fine.
raj_koothrappali Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, they kind of do.
raj_koothrappali Hmm. Uh, let me see something.
howard_wolowitz Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. I mean, yeah, maybe.
howard_wolowitz Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.
raj_koothrappali You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you.
howard_wolowitz You think?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.
howard_wolowitz Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. Ooh, brie’s ready.
raj_koothrappali Yay.
leonard_hofstadter Good morning.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
sheldon_cooper I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
leonard_hofstadter Where do you think I would take you?
sheldon_cooper Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going to work. You can come if you want.
sheldon_cooper Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t.
sheldon_cooper Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.
sheldon_cooper You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?
leonard_hofstadter Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?
sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll give you that one.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
sheldon_cooper I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. What I did was wrong.
sheldon_cooper I wish I could believe you.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying.
sheldon_cooper You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.
leonard_hofstadter Stop it.
sheldon_cooper Keep it up?
leonard_hofstadter Bye.
sheldon_cooper Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
penny Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?
amy_farrah_fowler Driving Sheldon to work.
penny He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray.
penny I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.
sheldon_cooper Thought I heard you out here.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.
penny Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…
sheldon_cooper Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
sheldon_cooper Yes. You’re either with me or against me.
amy_farrah_fowler You want to take the bus to work?
sheldon_cooper Maybe there’s a third option.
amy_farrah_fowler FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.
leonard_hofstadter So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.
howard_wolowitz That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.
sheldon_cooper Howard, Raj. Judas.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? You’re a crazy person.
sheldon_cooper A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.
howard_wolowitz Stop it.
sheldon_cooper Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
howard_wolowitz I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.
raj_koothrappali A little loud, dude.
howard_wolowitz So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper I suppose so.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.
sheldon_cooper And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.
leonard_hofstadter I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.
penny I’m so glad you guys are friends again.
sheldon_cooper And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.
penny Aw.
sheldon_cooper Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.
penny Fifty cents off Vagisil.
sheldon_cooper Think of me when you apply it.
raj_koothrappali Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.
sheldon_cooper Yeah.
penny Me, too.
leonard_hofstadter Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that happened right after you left.
leonard_hofstadter And no one told me?
howard_wolowitz Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.
penny Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
