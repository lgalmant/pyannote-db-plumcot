bernadette And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
penny Ooh, one gravy boat.
amy That’s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.
bernadette In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.
penny One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.
amy When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
penny Ew, why?
amy ‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
bernadette So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
amy Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don’t tell Sheldon. He’s still a flight risk.
bernadette What about you, Penny?
penny What about me what?
bernadette Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
penny Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.
bernadette But do you think you’ll ever get married?
penny He’s a sweetie.
amy You’re not answering the question. Do you love him?
penny Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
bernadette It doesn’t sound like it.
penny Well, I do.
bernadette Do you tell him that?
penny No, he’d just take it the wrong way.
amy What does that mean?
penny It means he is special and smart and nice and…
bernadette Are you gonna break up with him?
penny No. Maybe. I don’t know.
bernadette I had no idea you were unhappy.
penny That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
bernadette Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.
penny Amy, you?
amy Can’t help ya, kid. Whenever I’m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.
raj Hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?
howard You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.
leonard So, is it everything you hoped it would be?
howard It’s better. I wake up every morning and I just can’t believe I’m on this incredible adventure.
dimitri Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?
howard Excuse me. I’m talking to my friends.
mike You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.
dimitri If you do good job, next time we give you brush.
howard Funny. We’re always giving each other a hard time up here. It’s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.
sheldon Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
leonard Go ahead.
sheldon 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over.
howard Yes, I read you, Sheldon.
sheldon Copy that. Over.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon I am talking to a man in space. If you don’t have the then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
howard You’re out of your mind,Sheldon.
sheldon That’s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over.
mike Come on, scrub it up, Loops.
howard All right, all right. I gotta go. There’s a meteor shower.
mike You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.
howard Bye.
sheldon Over and out.
raj Bye, buddy!
stuart Hello.
raj Hey, Stuart, come on in.
sheldon What are you doing here?
stuart Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
sheldon Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.
leonard Sheldon, you are not in charge.
sheldon That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
raj What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.
sheldon The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.
leonard It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz.
sheldon Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
stuart I can take them or leave them.
sheldon At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.
stuart Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
sheldon Well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets.
stuart Okay. Should we go?
sheldon Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.
stuart All right.
sheldon Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?
stuart I went to art school.
sheldon Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.
sheldon This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
amy Well, I like it.
sheldon Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
amy Just watch the movie.
sheldon It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.
amy There might be a reason for that.
sheldon Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
amy Penny said she’s not sure she wants to be Leonard’s girlfriend anymore.
sheldon Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
amy So?
sheldon So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?
amy It’s complicated.
sheldon String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?
amy She’s not sure how she feels.
sheldon How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.
amy Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.
sheldon Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?
amy Yes, please, Penny will kill me.
sheldon Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head.
stuart Raisinet?
sheldon Shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
leonard Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
sheldon Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.
leonard I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
sheldon Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people, Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you.
leonard Okay.
sheldon I can’t tell you.
leonard Why?
sheldon I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.
leonard I wish there were more.
sheldon Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.
leonard What is it?
sheldon I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
leonard Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
sheldon Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.
leonard Okay, I think I understand.
sheldon You do?
leonard The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
sheldon That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard What?
sheldon Are you sleeping?
leonard I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?
sheldon Never mind. I still can’t tell you.
sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny Oh, my God. Sheldon?
sheldon You frightened me.
penny What are you doing in my bedroom?
sheldon Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it.
penny How did you even get in, you weirdo?
sheldon Yeah, really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it’s weird?
penny What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk.
penny Talk about what?
sheldon Oh, I don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
penny Okay, go home, crazy man.
sheldon Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s North Korea, he’s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.
penny Okay, what did Amy tell you?
sheldon Oh, very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
penny Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?
sheldon Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
penny Of course not.
sheldon Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
penny Worst bedtime story ever.
sheldon My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
penny Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?
sheldon I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
penny Get out.
sheldon Penny?
penny What?
sheldon Please don’t hurt my friend.
penny That is the last thing I want to do.
sheldon Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
penny Get out.
amy Hello?
penny What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in?
amy Hang on, please. Hello?
amy I know. She’s yelling at me right now.
sheldon All right then, so we’re all on the same page. Yes.
howard Hey, Bernie.
bernadette There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?
howard Oh, it’s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.
bernadette What’s wrong?
howard Nothing. Everything’s fine.
bernadette Howard.
howard The other astronauts are being mean to me.
bernadette No, what are they doing?
howard Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.
bernadette Oh, Howie.
howard You can see it if you want. It’s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
bernadette Why don’t you stand up to them?
howard What am I supposed to say?
bernadette I don’t know. Say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice.
howard Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.
bernadette Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
howard No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
leonard Gelatinous Sphere.
raj Focused Locust.
stuart Temple of Yip.
sheldon I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
stuart All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
sheldon Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.
raj So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
stuart We’re gonna try to meet some girls.
raj ‘Cause that’s what we do.
stuart Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.
raj In case you didn’t follow that, I’m the coffee.
sheldon Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
leonard Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
sheldon Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up.
leonard You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
stuart No, please don’t ruin this for me.
sheldon Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
leonard Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
sheldon But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.
leonard What’s your point?
sheldon Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
leonard This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
stuart I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
sheldon Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.
leonard So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.
penny Really?
leonard Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream.
penny Mmm.
leonard I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
penny Uh-huh.
leonard You okay? You seem a little distracted.
penny Look, there’s something I need to tell you.
leonard Oh. Yeah, okay.
penny I don’t really know how to say this.
leonard Just say it.
penny Okay. Here goes.
leonard Mm-hmm.
amy You slept with him?
penny I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.
bernadette Oh, sure, you had no choice.
penny He looked at me like this.
amy Well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog.
bernadette Don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.
penny Look, it’s fine. We’re not getting married, okay? We’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis.
amy It’s so cute when she tries.
penny It’s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You’re amazing. I’m so lucky to have you in my life. Okay, stop it.
howard Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night’s sleep.
bernadette Oh, Howie.
howard What’s wrong? You look upset.
bernadette Nope, this is my proud face.
