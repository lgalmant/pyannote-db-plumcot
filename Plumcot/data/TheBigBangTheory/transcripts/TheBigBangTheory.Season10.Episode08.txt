sheldon_cooper How much will it hurt?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
sheldon_cooper On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.
amy_farrah_fowler A two.
sheldon_cooper Eating a whole Altoid?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to.
sheldon_cooper No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, jiminy, that’s cold.
amy_farrah_fowler Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
sheldon_cooper All right, just warn me before you do it.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Three, two, and we’re done.
sheldon_cooper You tricked me. You didn’t say one.
amy_farrah_fowler It didn’t hurt, did it?
sheldon_cooper No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, fine, one.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.
cleaner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode08 Uh, sorry, I could come back.
raj_koothrappali Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble.
cleaner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode08 Oh, do I need a mop?
raj_koothrappali It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
cleaner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode08 Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce.
cleaner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode08 What is your name?
cleaner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode08 You think it would be more difficult than that?
raj_koothrappali Good point. And you are?
cleaner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode08 Oh, uh, Isabella Maria Concepcion.
raj_koothrappali Oh, well, nice to meet you.
issabella Nice to meet you, too. You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, working here was ten years old.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.
issabella Bueno, um, I’m just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I’ll get out of your way.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.
issabella Thank you.
raj_koothrappali You’re welcome.
issabella Okay, uh, okay, I have to go.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
issabella Good luck with your, um, space exploration.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
sheldon_cooper Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?
amy_farrah_fowler If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful.
amy_farrah_fowler Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.
sheldon_cooper I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys.
amy_farrah_fowler These cells come from both of us.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?
amy_farrah_fowler No reason we can’t start right now.
sheldon_cooper What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do.
sheldon_cooper I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one.
howard_wolowitz Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.
raj_koothrappali Oh, no, that’s mine.
leonard_hofstadter Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
raj_koothrappali Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.
penny You’re dating somebody, who is it?
raj_koothrappali What? What are you talking about?
penny You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
howard_wolowitz No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage.
raj_koothrappali That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
penny All right, fine, don’t tell us.
raj_koothrappali There’s nothing to tell.
penny All right.
leonard_hofstadter How’s that broccoli?
raj_koothrappali It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
penny Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?
raj_koothrappali Isabella.
howard_wolowitz Oh, did you meet her at work?
raj_koothrappali Yes, in the telescope room.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, so she’s an astronomer?
raj_koothrappali Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good.
penny Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common.
raj_koothrappali Mm-hmm.
howard_wolowitz So, when do we meet her?
raj_koothrappali No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, good luck with it.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
penny How come you never eat broccoli?
leonard_hofstadter I’m married, I don’t have to be attractive.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years.
bernadette_rostenkowski Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit.
sheldon_cooper Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you.
sheldon_cooper Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m running out of ways to act excited.
amy_farrah_fowler So, enough about us, how are things going with you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now.
amy_farrah_fowler Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
sheldon_cooper Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.
bernadette_rostenkowski You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.
bernadette_rostenkowski Mine has a fully developed immune system.
sheldon_cooper Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that’s enough.
sheldon_cooper Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.
raj_koothrappali This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
issabella You’re kidding.
raj_koothrappali No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.
issabella It’s okay, you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady.
raj_koothrappali Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.
issabella I think that’s called a mommy.
raj_koothrappali Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?
issabella No, not for many years.
raj_koothrappali Oh, so, you are unencumbered?
issabella Just me and my son.
raj_koothrappali I love kids, how old is he?
issabella Nineteen.
raj_koothrappali That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.
issabella He’s studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.
raj_koothrappali That’s wonderful. A lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common.
issabella Yeah, I guess we do.
raj_koothrappali Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?
issabella Ay, Rajesh, I think you’re very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don’t have time for dating.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too.
issabella Oh, please don’t take it personal, I think you’re a very nice man.
raj_koothrappali I think you’re very nice as well.
issabella Thank you for helping me. Good night, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.
issabella Good night, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you.
sheldon_cooper Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ve never seen results like this before.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge.
amy_farrah_fowler Aren’t you glad you participated in this?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?
amy_farrah_fowler Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
sheldon_cooper Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.
amy_farrah_fowler Make a baby? What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.
amy_farrah_fowler Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
amy_farrah_fowler Not right now.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.
sheldon_cooper Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?
raj_koothrappali Welcome.
issabella What is this?
raj_koothrappali Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.
issabella Oh, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.
issabella Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I’m working.
raj_koothrappali That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
issabella Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.
issabella Oh, really? You made Cuban food?
raj_koothrappali That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?
penny Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?
amy_farrah_fowler No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.
leonard_hofstadter Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
penny Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything.
leonard_hofstadter That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
penny Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man.
penny Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.
leonard_hofstadter Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two.
sheldon_cooper Well, hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
sheldon_cooper Would you care for a brandy?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think so.
sheldon_cooper Good choice, it’s disgusting.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.
sheldon_cooper Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
amy_farrah_fowler I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
sheldon_cooper Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I’ve had enough.
sheldon_cooper Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters.
raj_koothrappali So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?
issabella Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah’s favourite things.
raj_koothrappali I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.
issabella You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you’d like to…
howard_wolowitz Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
raj_koothrappali Uh.
issabella It’s okay. Uh, I should get back to work.
howard_wolowitz Hi. Howard Wolowitz.
issabella Oh. Isabella Concepcion.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper.
issabella You told him I was an astronomer?
raj_koothrappali Uh.
issabella I understand. Time to go.
raj_koothrappali No, p-please don’t.
issabella It’s okay, Rajesh, I’m a grown woman. I don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me.
howard_wolowitz I can keep this, right?
raj_koothrappali Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.
issabella If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.
issabella I doubt that.
raj_koothrappali Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies.
howard_wolowitz Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart.
raj_koothrappali Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
issabella You’re very persistent.
raj_koothrappali It’s my one move.
issabella Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.
raj_koothrappali Great. Where would you like to go?
issabella Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, but I’m Indian.
issabella And now you know how it feels.
penny So, were you turned on even a little bit?
amy_farrah_fowler It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, is that a yes?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Amy, I didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.
amy_farrah_fowler For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper You guys are aroused, right?
amy_farrah_fowler That was a close one.
