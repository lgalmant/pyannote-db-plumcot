raj_koothrappali Water Demon.
howard_wolowitz Ice Dragon.
leonard_hofstadter Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
sheldon_cooper Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Infinite Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
leonard_hofstadter Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
sheldon_cooper No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
zack_johnson Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, thanks.
penny Mm-hmm.
zack_johnson Check it out, all about planets this month.
leonard_hofstadter That’s an atom.
zack_johnson Agree to disagree. That’s what I love about science, there’s no one right answer.
leonard_hofstadter So, you and Zack again, huh?
penny Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
zack_johnson Were we here earlier?
penny Okay, we should, we should go.
zack_johnson Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.
howard_wolowitz Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?
zack_johnson You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it’ll just come back to life.
sheldon_cooper Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
zack_johnson No, I’m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.
leonard_hofstadter They might be smarter than some people.
zack_johnson Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.
zack_johnson I don’t get it.
leonard_hofstadter A dolphin might.
zack_johnson Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I’m stupid.
sheldon_cooper That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
zack_johnson Let’s go.
penny You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.
raj_koothrappali What the hell did I do?
penny You laughed.
leonard_hofstadter You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
howard_wolowitz No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.
raj_koothrappali And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
leonard_hofstadter That happened to you?
raj_koothrappali First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
howard_wolowitz So go apologize.
leonard_hofstadter Why me?
howard_wolowitz You started it, we just piled on.
leonard_hofstadter What would I even say?
sheldon_cooper Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
raj_koothrappali A Milk Dud?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
leonard_hofstadter I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
raj_koothrappali Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
sheldon_cooper You’re embarrassing yourself.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.
zack_johnson What do you want?
leonard_hofstadter Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.
zack_johnson No, you weren’t. You were making fun of me.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
sheldon_cooper That’s very hurtful.
leonard_hofstadter See?
zack_johnson I don’t know, it still wasn’t very nice.
sheldon_cooper Milk Dud?
zack_johnson Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we’re cool.
sheldon_cooper Junior Mints.
zack_johnson You guys want to come in and have a beer?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.
howard_wolowitz Leonard’s buying.
zack_johnson Really? I haven’t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.
sheldon_cooper Literally? Literally a million years?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t.
zack_johnson You want to go with ’em?
penny No.
zack_johnson Okay, see you later.
penny Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?
zack_johnson Are you mad at me?
penny I’m not happy.
zack_johnson Milk Dud?
zack_johnson Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?
sheldon_cooper In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.
zack_johnson Oh, no, you’re thinking old-school Archie. It’s much more sophisticated now. Like, there’s two universes, and Archie’s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.
raj_koothrappali No.
zack_johnson About time, right?
stuart_bloom Hey.
zack_johnson Hey.
stuart_bloom You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.
zack_johnson Wow, lucky you.
stuart_bloom Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.
zack_johnson Sweet.
stuart_bloom Is that sarcasm?
howard_wolowitz Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system.
raj_koothrappali The Archies are over here.
zack_johnson Yippee.
stuart_bloom So are you guys coming to my New Year’s Eve costume party?
sheldon_cooper Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
howard_wolowitz Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
sheldon_cooper To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
sheldon_cooper That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
stuart_bloom Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard’s mother in high-heeled boots?
sheldon_cooper I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
leonard_hofstadter Zack?
howard_wolowitz He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
leonard_hofstadter You can’t replace me with Zack.
sheldon_cooper Why not? Penny did it.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?
zack_johnson Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?
zack_johnson I don’t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.
raj_koothrappali But I’m Green Lantern.
leonard_hofstadter You can be Aquaman.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
zack_johnson Hey, babe.
penny I’m still mad at you.
zack_johnson Well, you won’t be when you hear the great news.
penny What great news?
zack_johnson We’re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year’s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.
sheldon_cooper Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
penny Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
howard_wolowitz She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
penny Okay, what about your friend Amy?
sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
penny Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
howard_wolowitz He says he’ll wear it if you’ll be Aquaman.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
leonard_hofstadter You’re jogging.
sheldon_cooper This is how the Flash paces.
sheldon_cooper I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
howard_wolowitz I’m Batman.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.
howard_wolowitz I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.
raj_koothrappali I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
zack_johnson Look up in the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. I forget the rest.
penny All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
howard_wolowitz Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.
zack_johnson Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?
penny No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
zack_johnson Come on. We’re trying to win a contest here.
penny Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
zack_johnson Penny, there’s no I in Justice League.
howard_wolowitz Well, actually.
sheldon_cooper Don’t. He’s making our case.
zack_johnson Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.
penny Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
raj_koothrappali Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
zack_johnson Babe, open up.
penny I’m not talking to you.
zack_johnson Then who are you talking to? Babe?
penny What the hell is wrong with you?
sheldon_cooper I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.
penny Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I understand why you’re upset.
penny Really?
sheldon_cooper Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
penny No. Wait, wait, does it?
sheldon_cooper Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
penny Good-bye, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
raj_koothrappali Stupid Aquaman.
leonard_hofstadter If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.
zack_johnson Whoa. You dated Penny?
leonard_hofstadter She didn’t tell you?
zack_johnson She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?
leonard_hofstadter Who else would it be?
zack_johnson I don’t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?
sheldon_cooper I may have failed.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.
zack_johnson I don’t want to go without Penny.
raj_koothrappali Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
sheldon_cooper Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, I call Kermit.
sheldon_cooper I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
raj_koothrappali Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
howard_wolowitz No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.
leonard_hofstadter What makes you think I can convince her?
howard_wolowitz You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
penny Go away, Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter It’s Leonard.
penny Oh. Go away, Leonard.
penny It’s open.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny I’m not going to that party, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
penny It’s not the wig.
leonard_hofstadter Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.
penny Okay, look. We’re not really me and him.
leonard_hofstadter Then what are you?
penny I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
leonard_hofstadter Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
penny You make a cute Green Arrow.
leonard_hofstadter Green Lantern.
penny Like there’s a difference.
leonard_hofstadter There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
penny Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.
leonard_hofstadter What about me?
penny Nothing. Let’s go to the party. How do I look?
leonard_hofstadter Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.
howard_wolowitz Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.
sheldon_cooper Oh.
zack_johnson Yes.
sheldon_cooper What’s the bad news?
howard_wolowitz Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
zack_johnson Aw, damn.
stuart_bloom And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!
sheldon_cooper Thank you! Thank you so much!
stuart_bloom Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.
all@ Ten, nine, eight…
sheldon_cooper No, wait! I have a speech.
