penny Hey. So you guys ready to order?
sheldon Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?
penny Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger.
amy Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?
penny Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend.
sheldon Probably serving food that was ordered today.
amy That’s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
penny The what?
leonard It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
penny Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.
amy Shame. Since you’re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.
penny I’m your best friend?
amy Don’t you read my blog?
penny Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him.
amy Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
penny No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?
leonard I think her weekend just opened up.
penny Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?
leonard Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
penny You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.
amy Please don’t touch my breasts.
penny I, I wasn’t going to.
amy All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
penny Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages.
sheldon In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.
penny You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.
amy That does seem to be a valid principle.
sheldon I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
amy I don’t believe there’s any such thing.
sheldon You lied to me?
sheldon Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off.
leonard Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.
sheldon Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder.
howard Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
sheldon All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.
amy Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.
penny Yay!
sheldon She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.
penny Brawny?
leonard They’re bigger than mine.
sheldon Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.
howard Fine. Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
sheldon It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
howard Still right behind you.
sheldon Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.
penny So, Amy, I’ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
amy No, we discussed it. We decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.
sheldon Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
leonard I can vouch for that.
penny Hey.
leonard Not you, him.
penny Oh. Thanks.
leonard Although yours was an eye-opener.
amy Don’t worry, Penny. You’re my plus-one. You’ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I’m the ideal hotel roommate.
penny Terrific. Are we there yet?
bernadette I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
howard Really? You want to see the keynote?
howard Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.
bernadette Really? And miss the keynote?
howard We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.
bernadette Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?
howard No, see, it’s not…
bernadette Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.
leonard Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.
bernadette Oh. Thank you, Raj.
leonard Are you an element in the actinoid series?
sheldon No. Amy?
amy Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
sheldon No.
amy Are you in the lanthanoid series?
sheldon Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?
penny Uh, I don’t know. Are you food?
sheldon That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
penny Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?
sheldon I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
penny Who elected you Road Trip God?
sheldon Leonard.
leonard It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor.
sheldon Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
penny I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?
penny I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
howard What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.
bernadette Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.
howard Yeah. It’s the Love Car.
penny Should I ask?
bernadette They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow.
howard Well, I don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.
together Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…
penny Red Leader, I’m really sorry.
howard_and_bernadette I got you, babe.
amy I missed you.
penny You know what? I missed you, too.
very_tall_and_powerfully_built_man Bernadette?
bernadette Oh, my God, Glenn!
glenn Great to see you!
bernadette Are you here for the conference?
glenn Yeah, I’m doing a global warming panel.
bernadette Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.
glenn Oh. Nice to meet you.
howard Hi. Ow. Hi.
glenn You’re a lucky man. Bernie’s a great gal.
howard Yes. Bernie sure is.
bernadette I’ll try to catch it.
glenn Oh, great. Bye.
bernadette Bye.
howard Hey, Bernie?
bernadette Yeah?
howard Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
bernadette No. He was one of my professors in college.
howard Oh! That’s a relief.
bernadette Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.
howard No, it’s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!
howard That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.
bernadette Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
howard No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?
bernadette Six-seven.
howard Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
bernadette Is something bothering you?
howard No. It’s just…
bernadette What?
howard I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.
bernadette Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.
howard Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?
bernadette You can’t think that way.
howard Yep. Loser.
bernadette Howard, stop it.
howard Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
bernadette Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?
howard I’m… I…
bernadette Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
howard No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite.
bernadette I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
howard Yeah, let’s go with that.
amy Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.
penny Will do.
amy So, girl talk?
penny Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
amy Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
penny Um, I never really thought about it. Why?
amy Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
penny Really?
amy Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.
penny Again, I’ve never given it much thought.
amy We have time now. Think about it.
penny Oh, good. Hey.
bernadette Can I stay here tonight?
penny Yeah. Why, what happened?
bernadette Howard’s a complete and total ass.
penny Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.
bernadette Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.
amy Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
penny We are?
amy Of course, we’re best friends.
penny Oh, right, right, the blog.
amy Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine.
penny Hey, can I stay here tonight?
leonard Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
penny Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites.
leonard What?
penny Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
leonard Uh, sure.
penny All right.
leonard So, how do you wanna do this?
penny Well, I’m not getting in bed with him.
leonard Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin.
penny We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
leonard Okay, when you say make the best of it.
penny Sleep.
leonard Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
penny The what?
leonard Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.
penny Oh, okay. Just like old times.
leonard Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.
penny Sweetie, let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.
leonard Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?
penny Go to sleep.
leonard Good night.
sheldon Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
penny We are not having coitus.
sheldon Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
penny Yes.
leonard No.
tv_announcer Next on Turner Classic Movies, Bridget Jones’s Diary.
raj Oh, my God, I’m crying already.
sheldon Raj? Raj? Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
raj Why?
sheldon Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.
raj Okay. Come on in.
penny Leonard, are you asleep?
leonard No.
penny I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
leonard Sure, no problem.
penny I know it’s kinda weird.
leonard True dat.
penny True dat?
leonard I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
penny Right. Still mad at me about that?
leonard No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.
penny Thank you.
leonard I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
penny Good for you.
leonard Okay, good night.
penny Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!
raj Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.
leonard Penny’s here. No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!
sheldon Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?
bernadette Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.
howard Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.
bernadette I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
amy Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.
sheldon Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?
raj Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.
leonard I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
raj What did I do?
leonard Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
raj I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
penny We weren’t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
sheldon Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
penny Oh, shut up, Sheldon!
amy Hi, bestie.
penny Yeah, hi.
sheldon All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic.
howard Let me ask you something, Bernie.
sheldon I guess not.
howard How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
bernadette Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
howard What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
raj I’d like to weigh in here. No.
sheldon All right, why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?
penny Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?
glenn I’m driving back to L.A. tonight.
bernadette Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny.
leonard No!
sheldon Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal.
sheldon Must be out of range.
amy Leonard, can I ask you a question?
leonard Sure.
amy Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?
leonard No. Why do you ask?
amy Because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
sheldon All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.
