sheldon_cooper Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
leonard_hofstadter Problem?
sheldon_cooper This is Thai food.
howard_wolowitz Here we go.
sheldon_cooper We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
sheldon_cooper Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
howard_wolowitz Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.
sheldon_cooper Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
raj_koothrappali I could go for some goat.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight.
sheldon_cooper All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
raj_koothrappali We went to the comic book store last night.
sheldon_cooper Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday.
leonard_hofstadter Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali So what are we going to do tonight?
howard_wolowitz If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
howard_wolowitz Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
sheldon_cooper The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.
raj_koothrappali The Wolowitz Coefficient?
howard_wolowitz Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.
leonard_hofstadter You’re joking.
howard_wolowitz I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.
raj_koothrappali Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!
raj_koothrappali Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
leonard_hofstadter Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
raj_koothrappali Also a good plan.
howard_wolowitz Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, absolutely.
raj_koothrappali You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!
sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
penny Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?
sheldon_cooper To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
penny You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
sheldon_cooper I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
penny Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. What does he like?
penny I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.
sheldon_cooper Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.
penny Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
sheldon_cooper Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?
penny Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?
penny Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.
penny Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them.
penny Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?
sheldon_cooper A superb choice.
penny Oh, great.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.
penny What’s a multiverse?
sheldon_cooper Get her out of here.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, I’ll help you pick something.
raj_koothrappali That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
howard_wolowitz Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.
store_clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books.
stuart_bloom Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will.
leonard_hofstadter I think we’re fine, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Let me know if you need anything.
penny Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
leonard_hofstadter You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
penny No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
penny What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
leonard_hofstadter Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.
howard_wolowitz Let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
howard_wolowitz Yes, but I saw it from the front.
sheldon_cooper A far less impressive feat.
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.
sheldon_cooper I need it for my Robin collection.
howard_wolowitz Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
sheldon_cooper Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
howard_wolowitz You let go.
sheldon_cooper No, you!
leonard_hofstadter Problem?
sheldon_cooper Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book.
howard_wolowitz It’s my comic book!
sheldon_cooper Leonard, we need a ruling.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, cut it in half?
penny Excuse me.
stuart_bloom Hello again.
penny Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
stuart_bloom A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic book, try this.
penny Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?
stuart_bloom A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.
penny Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?
stuart_bloom Depends. Do you like it?
penny It’s really good.
stuart_bloom Yes, that’s you.
penny That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?
stuart_bloom It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
howard_wolowitz I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
sheldon_cooper Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.
raj_koothrappali Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?
leonard_hofstadter Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go.
penny Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture.
stuart_bloom You drive a hard bargain, but here.
penny All right. So, um, just give me a call.
sheldon_cooper So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
sheldon_cooper Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?
leonard_hofstadter Apparently so.
sheldon_cooper Are you ill?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
leonard_hofstadter When did you pick up on that?
sheldon_cooper A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, why not?
sheldon_cooper Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
leonard_hofstadter Gee, thanks a lot.
sheldon_cooper Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
sheldon_cooper My original point.
sheldon_cooper Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.
howard_wolowitz Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
penny Oh, hey guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
stuart_bloom Hey, guys.
howard_wolowitz So what are you kids up to?
penny Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight.
leonard_hofstadter And you guys are going together, great…
stuart_bloom It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?
penny It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
sheldon_cooper Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.
penny Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.
stuart_bloom Yeah, see you guys.
howard_wolowitz See you, Stuart.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Howard?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Take me to a bar with women.
howard_wolowitz Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
howard_wolowitz Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.
leonard_hofstadter Do you…? Let’s go.
raj_koothrappali May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?
howard_wolowitz No, he may not.
raj_koothrappali Why?
howard_wolowitz I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
raj_koothrappali Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
howard_wolowitz Wrong again!
raj_koothrappali Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.
howard_wolowitz Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them.
raj_koothrappali Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
howard_wolowitz All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.
leonard_hofstadter Should we talk to some of these women?
howard_wolowitz It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.
leonard_hofstadter That’s your system?
howard_wolowitz That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine.
penny Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
stuart_bloom Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese.
penny Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
stuart_bloom Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?
penny Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
stuart_bloom Uh, yeah, I guess.
penny Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
stuart_bloom We’re having coffee.
sheldon_cooper Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
stuart_bloom It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.
penny I’ll just go look for it.
stuart_bloom What’s up?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.
stuart_bloom Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the topic?
sheldon_cooper I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
stuart_bloom Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong.
sheldon_cooper More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
stuart_bloom Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
sheldon_cooper Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
penny I found the decaf!
stuart_bloom Oh, great!
sheldon_cooper Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.
raj_koothrappali Barkeep! Alexander me.
leonard_hofstadter How about those two?
howard_wolowitz Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.
leonard_hofstadter What about the ones in the corner?
howard_wolowitz Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?
leonard_hofstadter I think Blinky’s cute.
howard_wolowitz You got it, sir.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, so we just go over there?
howard_wolowitz No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires.
leonard_hofstadter What else you got?
howard_wolowitz Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine.
stuart_bloom I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.
sheldon_cooper Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
stuart_bloom Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right.
sheldon_cooper Au contraire.
stuart_bloom Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.
sheldon_cooper I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
stuart_bloom Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get some sleep.
sheldon_cooper So, I win.
stuart_bloom No, I’m tired.
sheldon_cooper So, I win.
stuart_bloom Fine. You win.
sheldon_cooper Darn tootin’, I win.
stuart_bloom Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.
stuart_bloom You know, I don’t think that was decaf.
howard_wolowitz Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was their card.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
howard_wolowitz I do, all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called.
howard_wolowitz Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?
leonard_hofstadter Say what?
howard_wolowitz You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
howard_wolowitz Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
howard_wolowitz Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go. Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent of his. Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped.
