bernadette_rostenkowski What you doing?
howard_wolowitz You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.
bernadette_rostenkowski You can’t just throw everything in the closet.
howard_wolowitz Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.
bernadette_rostenkowski What if someone looks in there?
howard_wolowitz They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
howard_wolowitz Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
howard_wolowitz You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why?
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet.
howard_wolowitz No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
howard_wolowitz Hey, guys, come on in.
all@ Hi.
penny Ooh, it smells good.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you shouldn’t have.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, it’s my pleasure.
sheldon_cooper No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.
bernadette_rostenkowski You stopped and got him takeout?
leonard_hofstadter I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.
sheldon_cooper Well, now don’t you feel silly.
bernadette_rostenkowski Show him the closet.
raj_koothrappali These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.
raj_koothrappali Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.
sheldon_cooper Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
howard_wolowitz Colour’s fine.
sheldon_cooper Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.
penny Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
amy_farrah_fowler His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.
sheldon_cooper Oh, five more minutes.
leonard_hofstadter That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.
sheldon_cooper How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
howard_wolowitz You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
sheldon_cooper Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
sheldon_cooper Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
howard_wolowitz Juggle.
sheldon_cooper You health nuts kill me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
sheldon_cooper Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
howard_wolowitz Whoa, you opened this?
sheldon_cooper Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
howard_wolowitz I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?
howard_wolowitz If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.
sheldon_cooper Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
howard_wolowitz Do whatever you want.
sheldon_cooper Thanks. Oh. Great party.
leonard_hofstadter You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.
penny What is your point?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
penny Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
leonard_hofstadter Trying to paint a picture.
penny It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
penny Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Although…
penny No.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, you okay?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
bernadette_rostenkowski Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it.
howard_wolowitz It’s this stupid letter.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did you read it?
howard_wolowitz No.
bernadette_rostenkowski You must be curious.
howard_wolowitz Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?
bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
howard_wolowitz He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
bernadette_rostenkowski I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?
howard_wolowitz Something I should have done a long time ago.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Are you sure?
howard_wolowitz Yep.
bernadette_rostenkowski Feel better?
howard_wolowitz I do. Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe he set it on fire.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
amy_farrah_fowler Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
penny What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
bernadette_rostenkowski That works.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
amy_farrah_fowler You have something we want.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
penny No, we just want information.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.
penny We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
sheldon_cooper I did.
penny What did it say?
sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.
sheldon_cooper Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.
penny Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
sheldon_cooper Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.
penny Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?
sheldon_cooper Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
penny Yeah, obviously.
sheldon_cooper Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.
raj_koothrappali Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, all I did was invite you.
raj_koothrappali Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
leonard_hofstadter I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.
raj_koothrappali So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, where have you been?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
leonard_hofstadter One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.
leonard_hofstadter What information?
sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
raj_koothrappali Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.
sheldon_cooper Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, then that.
sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.
amy_farrah_fowler This is really fun.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.
penny Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.
leonard_hofstadter As is the company.
penny Aw.
sheldon_cooper My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
raj_koothrappali Of course.
penny Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler Absolutely.
sheldon_cooper If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
howard_wolowitz Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, try doing it in heels.
howard_wolowitz I am.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.
howard_wolowitz What?
bernadette_rostenkowski I know what was in your dad’s letter.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski I made him tell us.
howard_wolowitz What? Us? Who else knows?
penny I know.
amy_farrah_fowler Me, too.
leonard_hofstadter Same here.
raj_koothrappali Shame on all of you.
leonard_hofstadter You know, too.
raj_koothrappali Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?
howard_wolowitz So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
sheldon_cooper Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.
howard_wolowitz How could you do this?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry.
raj_koothrappali If you want, we could tell you.
howard_wolowitz No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.
amy_farrah_fowler Use me as a human shield!
sheldon_cooper I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard?
howard_wolowitz In here.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.
howard_wolowitz It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you looking at?
howard_wolowitz Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s nice.
howard_wolowitz I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.
bernadette_rostenkowski Think you could take a break?
howard_wolowitz Why?
bernadette_rostenkowski Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
howard_wolowitz Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?
leonard_hofstadter When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, what’s that?
sheldon_cooper It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
penny We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…
sheldon_cooper Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
penny Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sit down, honey.
leonard_hofstadter Raj, you’re up.
raj_koothrappali Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
howard_wolowitz Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.
amy_farrah_fowler Told you.
sheldon_cooper Don’t.
leonard_hofstadter Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.
howard_wolowitz Really?
sheldon_cooper Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
leonard_hofstadter Penny.
penny It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
sheldon_cooper I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s not.
sheldon_cooper Don’t.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
howard_wolowitz Hmm.
leonard_hofstadter Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I’m terrific.
leonard_hofstadter So, which one do you think it is, matey?
howard_wolowitz Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true.
leonard_hofstadter Well, one of them is.
howard_wolowitz That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.
penny Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?
raj_koothrappali Yeah,
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, cool.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
sheldon_cooper You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, don’t you dare.
sheldon_cooper There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s more like it.
sheldon_cooper Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
bernadette_rostenkowski Glad you’re feeling better.
howard_wolowitz Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
penny This turned out pretty well, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I think so.
raj_koothrappali I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.
amy_farrah_fowler If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.
sheldon_cooper Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?
penny Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
sheldon_cooper Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
penny Party’s over! Party’s over!
