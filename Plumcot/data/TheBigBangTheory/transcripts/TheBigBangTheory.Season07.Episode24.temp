leonard How’s your mom holding up?
howard She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.
amy How many is that now?
howard Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.
bernadette She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.
sheldon So, who’s watching her now?
howard A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.
raj What up, guys?
all Hello, hey!
leonard Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.
raj And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
leonard Hey, hey, what the hell?
bernadette You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
penny You’re right! Yay!
raj Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?
howard Because you had sex the other night?
raj You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.
leonard Hey, buddy.
sheldon Hello.
leonard You okay?
sheldon I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
howard Why?
sheldon He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face.
leonard That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.
sheldon It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university.
howard You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.
leonard Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.
sheldon I don’t know. I am really aggravated.
raj When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.
howard Oh, come on, give her a chance.
nurse No. Life, it is too short.
bernadette I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.
howard Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea.
bernadette That’s not helpful.
howard Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.
bernadette But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
howard Well, what if we use our vacation time?
bernadette I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
howard I don’t know what else we can do.
bernadette Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.
mrs_hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
leonard Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.
mrs_hofstadter I’m listening.
leonard Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?
mrs_hofstadter No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.
leonard I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
mrs_hofstadter Would you like for you and me to talk more?
leonard You know what? It’s probably fine.
mrs_hofstadter In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.
leonard I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
mrs_hofstadter Sure.
leonard Thanks, Mom.
mrs_hofstadter Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?
leonard Yes, it would.
mrs_hofstadter Yeah. Well, you should work on that.
penny No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.
amy Atomic magnets?
penny Shut up.
bernadette Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.
penny You want some wine?
bernadette Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.
penny I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
bernadette It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.
amy So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?
penny Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.
amy Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.
bernadette You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?
penny Not a chance.
bernadette Please. I’m desperate.
penny No.
bernadette I’ll pay you anything you want.
penny Okay, then, yeah.
penny No, keep your money.
bernadette I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
leonard What you working on?
sheldon I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.
leonard Oh. How’s it going?
sheldon You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.
leonard It’s nice that you called them esteemed.
sheldon You’re right. I’ll take that out.
leonard So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.
sheldon Mm.
leonard Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.
sheldon Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.
leonard I’m not.
sheldon Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.
leonard Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.
sheldon What do you mean?
leonard Well, well, we might want to live together.
sheldon Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.
leonard That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
sheldon I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?
leonard Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.
sheldon Where are you going to go?
leonard I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.
sheldon Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
leonard No, I did not.
sheldon Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
leonard No.
sheldon Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?
leonard Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
sheldon I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
leonard Well, yeah.
sheldon Wow.
sheldon How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
amy They just don’t appreciate you.
sheldon Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.
amy Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.
sheldon I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.
amy You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.
sheldon Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.
amy You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
sheldon Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?
amy See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.
sheldon I don’t know. Perhaps.
amy And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together.
sheldon You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?
amy Sheldon, it was just a thought.
sheldon No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder.
amy It tastes the same.
sheldon No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.
penny This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
leonard Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.
penny If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?
leonard It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
penny Sorry. I’ll get better.
leonard I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?
penny Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.
leonard Okay. And when would that be?
penny Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.
amy Hi, is Sheldon here?
leonard No, I thought he was with you.
amy He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone.
leonard What happened?
amy He was really angry that you suggested he move out.
leonard Oh.
amy I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
leonard Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.
amy You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?
penny Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
amy That’s nice.
leonard Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.
amy Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?
penny Amy, get out.
amy Right.
sheldon No.
stuart Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon What happened?
stuart I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
sheldon And you couldn’t put it out?
stuart I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.
sheldon So when will you reopen?
stuart Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
sheldon So, tomorrow?
stuart I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.
sheldon Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.
stuart Well, sorry I let you down.
sheldon No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.
stuart That’ll be $2.99.
sheldon Really? It’s soaking wet.
stuart Fine, a dollar.
sheldon Can you break a twenty?
stuart No, I only have hundreds.
sheldon You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.
stuart That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.
leonard I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?
penny Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.
leonard I’m gonna see where he is.
penny How?
leonard Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.
penny You do that?
leonard Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.
penny He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.
leonard That’s weird.
penny What?
leonard He’s at the train station.
penny So? He loves trains.
leonard It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.
penny It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.
leonard It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
raj Dude, I’m so sorry.
howard Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?
stuart No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.
raj We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?
stuart Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.
raj Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.
stuart You slept with her? Nice.
raj Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.
howard Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
stuart Great.
howard I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.
stuart So what’s the catch?
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon You tracked my phone?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.
penny We were worried about you.
sheldon Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
leonard Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
sheldon My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.
leonard Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home.
sheldon No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
penny And go where?
sheldon It doesn’t matter.
leonard So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
sheldon I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
leonard Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.
sheldon Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
leonard Then what can I do?
sheldon Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.
leonard Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.
penny Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.
leonard What? Why?
penny It might be good for him.
leonard You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
penny He’s a grown man.
leonard No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.
penny Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.
leonard I know, but…
penny He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
sheldon Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.
penny Seriously, let him go.
leonard Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.
sheldon I do.
leonard Okay. Good luck.
penny Be safe and call us.
sheldon I will.
leonard Bye, buddy. Sheldon?
sheldon Yes?
leonard I’m gonna miss you.
sheldon Of course you are.
leonard He just made that easier.
penny Mm.
stuart Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.
howard You sure?
stuart Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV.
bernadette So, she’s not too much for you?
stuart Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.
mrs_wolowitz Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?
stuart Coming, Debbie.
howard You call her Debbie?
stuart She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.
howard Was that a little weird?
bernadette Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.
howard Okay, let’s go.
bernadette Yep.
amy Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.
leonard He’s okay?
amy Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
penny I really think this is gonna be for the best.
leonard Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…
amy How could you let him go?
