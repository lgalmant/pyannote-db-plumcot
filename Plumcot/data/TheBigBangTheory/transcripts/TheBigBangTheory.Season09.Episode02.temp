sheldon Why are you up?
leonard How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.
sheldon Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.
penny Hi.
leonard Hey.
penny You couldn’t sleep either?
leonard Of course not.
sheldon Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.
leonard What are we gonna do?
penny I don’t know.
leonard Please, tell me how I can fix it.
sheldon Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
leonard Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
penny Actually, I think he’s onto something.
leonard You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?
sheldon I’m currently single.
penny That’s true. You are.
leonard What is happening?
sheldon I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.
leonard U-u-u-uh!
amy Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.
sheldon Well, hello to you, too.
amy What do you want?
sheldon I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
amy What baby?
sheldon A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
amy I’m hanging up.
sheldon Great. See you in about half an hour.
amy Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.
sheldon Why not?
amy Because we’re broken up.
sheldon Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.
amy No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.
sheldon You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
amy Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.
sheldon Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.
raj I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
leonard Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.
raj And you knew about this this whole time?
howard I did.
raj And you didn’t think to tell me?
howard Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
raj Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
leonard Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?
raj Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
howard You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two.
raj I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
leonard Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.
raj Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
amy What are you doing here?
sheldon I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.
amy And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
sheldon On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.
amy Just give me the box.
sheldon Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?
amy Fine. My old scarf.
sheldon You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
amy You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?
sheldon We made one heck of a team, huh?
amy Whose bra is this?
sheldon It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
amy It’s Penny’s.
sheldon Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.
amy Good-bye.
sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.
howard Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!
bernadette Hands off. I’m mad at you.
howard Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself.
bernadette What will pay for itself?
howard Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?
bernadette I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.
howard And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it.
bernadette I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.
howard And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here.
bernadette I guess that’s true.
howard And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?
leonard Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here.
penny Hi.
leonard Call you back. Hey.
penny Can we talk?
leonard I would love that.
penny All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do.
leonard If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
sheldon Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.
penny Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information.
sheldon Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.
penny Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?
sheldon Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.
leonard Wake up, wake up, wake up.
sheldon Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
leonard What? Why?
sheldon Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.
leonard Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.
sheldon And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
leonard Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.
penny Really? Why is that?
leonard What, you actually want to meet her?
penny No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should.
leonard I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?
sheldon Yes. And that’s coming from me.
leonard Fine, you want to meet her?
penny No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on.
leonard How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
penny Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.
sheldon In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.
penny I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
amy Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
penny What do you think?
bernadette I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.
penny You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.
amy Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that.
penny I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
bernadette Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing.
penny You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now.
amy That’s because you made him more confident.
bernadette You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice.
penny I never thought about it like that.
bernadette Oh, me neither, not until just now.
leonard You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
howard 250 dollars an hour. Why?
raj How do you know?
howard Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.
raj And I’m just hearing about this now?
howard Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.
raj You don’t have to, you should want to.
leonard Oh, great, there’s Mandy.
howard Why are marine biologists always so cute?
raj I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.
leonard That’s not helpful.
howard Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
leonard Are we done?
raj Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?
leonard I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.
howard Leonard, wait.
leonard What?
howard I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.
raj Now we are done.
leonard Hey.
mandy Oh, hi, Leonard. What’s up?
leonard Uh, do you mind if I sit?
mandy Sure.
leonard So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.
mandy What about it?
leonard You know, what we did, when we were drunk.
mandy Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?
leonard No, we just made out.
mandy Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?
leonard Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
mandy Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?
leonard Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.
mandy It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?
leonard Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
mandy Is that really the reason?
leonard What else would it be?
mandy I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship.
leonard No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.
mandy Okay, well, that’s something to think about.
leonard You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.
mandy Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?
leonard I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.
mandy Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.
leonard Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.
mandy Imagine that.
leonard I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.
mandy And your wife is worried about me?
raj Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more.
sheldon And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.
amy I’m gonna kill him.
sheldon But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?
penny So, you said you had something to tell me.
leonard Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?
penny Uh-huh.
leonard I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.
penny I’m listening.
leonard Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.
penny Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.
leonard You do?
penny Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.
leonard I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
penny You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.
leonard Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
penny That sounds nice.
leonard Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.
penny Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.
leonard Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.
penny It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
leonard Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?
penny Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?
leonard Yes, please.
penny Okay.
penny Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift.
sheldon I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.
leonard What is this?
sheldon Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
penny Oh.
leonard Wow.
penny That’s so great.
sheldon Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.
penny We?
sheldon Is there a problem?
penny Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.
amy How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
sheldon You saw through that one, did you?
amy I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.
sheldon She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.
amy I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
sheldon She was listening through the door. She wants me.
