leonard Hey, will you steam my uniform next?
sheldon Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.
penny Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
leonard Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
penny Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.
leonard Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.
sheldon That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.
penny I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
leonard That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
penny Is that better?
leonard Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
sheldon So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.
penny Well, then why are you going?
sheldon It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good.
penny All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.
leonard Yeah.
penny Okay.
leonard Oh, hang on a second. Hold this.
penny What was that for?
leonard To show people when they don’t believe me.
penny Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.
amy Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.
bernadette He’s not exhausting at all.
penny Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa, but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL.
bernadette It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
amy When did Howard learn to sew?
bernadette When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.
amy I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.
penny I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
bernadette I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child.
amy It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.
penny Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.
bernadette I’ve never even read a comic book. You guys?
penny Uh-uh.
amy No.
bernadette I mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.
amy Seriously?
bernadette The comic book store isn’t far from here.
penny That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?
sheldon I think you should turn on the GPS.
leonard It is on.
sheldon But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
howard Has it really only been ten miles?
leonard I’m turning it on, but just to shut you up.
gps Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
sheldon Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.
leonard What did you do?
sheldon I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
raj That is so cool.
leonard Counterpoint, no, it’s not.
gps Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here’s an interesting fact about interstates.
leonard Really?
sheldon Shh, he said it’s interesting.
gps Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.
howard Look, Leonard, there’s a bridge. Drive off it.
raj You know, we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
sheldon Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.
howard We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
raj Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
leonard Yeah, that sounds fun.
sheldon Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?
leonard No.
sheldon Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
gps Recalculating. While we’re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
sheldon None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.
bernadette Why are they staring?
amy Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.
stuart Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They’re just girls. It’s nothing you haven’t seen in movies or in drawings.
penny Hey, Stuart.
stuart What brings you guys here?
bernadette We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
stuart Oh, well, I recommend you don’t open a store and sell them.
penny No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try.
stuart Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.
bernadette What kind of comics do the guys like?
stuart Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.
amy All right, well, who’s the best superhero?
stuart Shh! You can’t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?
penny Well then, what do you recommend?
stuart Well, uh, let’s see. You’ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
amy Ooh, I do love a bad boy.
penny As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
stuart If I were you, I’d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it’s intelligently written, and it doesn’t objectify or stereotype women.
penny Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.
stuart Yeah, he kind of is.
raj And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done.
sheldon I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes.
howard Come on, guys. Let’s do this.
leonard Yeah, I’m sweating my bald cap off.
howard So what’s our first pose going to be?
raj I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
leonard I’ll set the timer.
howard Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
sheldon Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.
raj Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.
howard Okay, what’s next?
raj Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That’s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…
howard Oh, my God. Leonard, someone’s stealing your car!
leonard What? Hey, hey! Come back here!
raj Stop!
sheldon Stealing is against the law!
leonard I don’t believe this.
howard Son of a bitch.
raj I’ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.
howard Oh, so is mine.
leonard Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?
sheldon Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. Nice going.
leonard What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
sheldon What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
leonard I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.
sheldon You’re right. Nice going.
howard Car.
raj What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?
sheldon Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
leonard Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.
sheldon Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.
howard Good idea. Why don’t you get started on that?
leonard Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.
sheldon What, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?
leonard Yes.
sheldon All right.
penny Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?
bernadette I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!
penny Yeah, well, I have street smarts.
bernadette So, what’d you guys think?
amy Well, there was a lot of action.
penny Mmm.
amy And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what’s the word I’m looking for?
penny Stupid?
amy So stupid.
penny I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
bernadette It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist.
amy What a waste of time.
penny I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
bernadette I don’t think it’s heavy. It’s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.
penny That makes even less sense, I mean…
amy No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.
penny Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?
bernadette No.
amy Yes.
penny Well, which is it?
amy Maybe we missed something.
bernadette Let’s read it again.
penny Okay.
amy Yeah.
bernadette You want some tea?
amy Good idea. I’ll help you.
penny Wait, I thought we were reading.
amy We are. We’re just, uh, giving you a head start.
howard I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.
raj Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.
leonard Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.
raj Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
sheldon Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.
leonard Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.
sheldon Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…
guys_in_passing_car Nerds!
sheldon I hate this planet.
amy It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
bernadette Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide?
penny Yes!
amy No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.
penny You said it’s a magic hammer.
amy Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions.
penny If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s hammer?
amy Okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can’t even take you seriously.
sheldon Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?
leonard Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
waitress Why don’t you ask Scotty to beam you up?
sheldon Scotty was on the original series, and we’re Next Generation. So, joke’s on you.
howard We’re not with him.
amy You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.
penny Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?
amy Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
bernadette Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don’t we go look at those?
penny Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.
policeman Was there anything valuable in the car?
leonard Our clothes, our wallets, phones.
raj And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.
policeman Makeup? Sure.
leonard Uh, we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds.
policeman I don’t know, sounds pretty cool.
raj It, it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.
leonard Okay, he gets how cool it is.
policeman I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I’m guessing your moms?
leonard Thanks, but we’ve got it covered.
howard Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.
raj Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
leonard Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through, I just want to go home.
raj Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.
howard I’m with Leonard. I’m done.
raj Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?
sheldon Actually, it’s three against one.
raj What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
sheldon Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.
raj Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.
bernadette Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?
amy Yeah?
bernadette Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.
amy No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.
penny Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?
amy Did that ever happen?
penny Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?
sheldon Well, I say that’s the last time we ever go outside.
amy Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor’s hammer ’cause Thor’s touching it.
penny No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching the strap.
amy The strap is part of the hammer.
bernadette No, it’s not!
raj Are they actually arguing about comic books?
leonard No, that can’t be right.
howard Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
bernadette Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
penny How could Red Hulk be worthy?
bernadette You don’t know his life.
sheldon There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
raj If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.
sheldon Captain, what are your orders?
leonard I say we investigate.
sheldon Wait. They might be hostile.
leonard Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
gps Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.
first_car_thief Wow, that is interesting.
second_car_thief You learn something new every day.
gps Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?
first_car_thief Ooh, another quiz.
second_car_thief Yes!
