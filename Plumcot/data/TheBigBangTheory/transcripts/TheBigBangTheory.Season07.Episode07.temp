amy I’ve never seen him this happy before.
leonard That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
sheldon Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.
leonard Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.
sheldon Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?
leonard Oh, yeah.
sheldon Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.
leonard Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.
sheldon I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him.
leonard He thinks there’s a difference.
sheldon Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.
arthur Trust me, I, I remember.
sheldon This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
arthur Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?
amy Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.
arthur Oh, okay, I get it now.
leonard Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.
arthur Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?
leonard No, she’s not.
sheldon So, what prescription are you getting filled?
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me.
arthur I wasn’t going to tell you.
amy Sheldon, come on.
sheldon No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
arthur Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess.
leonard Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.
sheldon But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.
howard Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
raj Actually, I’m busy.
howard Doing what?
raj There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
howard You’re going to girls’ night.
raj Yeah.
howard You know they’re making jewellery right?
raj You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
leonard What’s up?
howard Not his testosterone levels.
raj Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
howard How is that possible?
leonard Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.
sheldon Goody. What’s it say?
leonard He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.
sheldon That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.
howard You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
raj Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.
sheldon Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
howard It’s true, you’d rust.
sheldon And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.
amy Is it really worth getting upset about?
sheldon Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.
amy Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.
sheldon That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
amy Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
sheldon Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
amy Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.
sheldon That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.
amy From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…
sheldon What?
amy Doesn’t matter.
sheldon No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.
amy This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.
raj Penny, how’s it going over there?
penny Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.
amy How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
penny Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.
howard Hello, everyone.
raj Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.
howard Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.
raj Thank you.
howard So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.
bernadette Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.
howard Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.
amy I’m making a bracelet.
penny Yeah, I’m just making a mess.
howard You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.
raj Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.
amy Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.
bernadette Me, too.
howard Be right back.
penny When did I have pistachios?
sheldon Arthur. Arthur. Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.
arthur Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon I’m sorry, did I wake you?
arthur Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty.
sheldon Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.
arthur What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
arthur She sounds like a keeper.
sheldon Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.
arthur All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.
sheldon No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.
arthur Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.
sheldon Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.
arthur I should be so lucky.
sheldon So, uh, what do you say?
arthur You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.
sheldon It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
arthur Good night.
sheldon Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it.
arthur You’re annoying.
sheldon Well, that really hurt.
leonard If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.
arthur If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.
leonard I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.
sheldon Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.
leonard Why is it odd?
sheldon Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.
bill_nye Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.
arthur That’s what I told my lawyers.
leonard Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.
bill He said I’d be speaking to a class.
sheldon No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.
bill What are you guys working on?
leonard Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes.
bill Oh, that’s interesting.
arthur Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.
penny Hey, guys, what do you think?
amy Wow, Penny, good job.
penny Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.
amy What are you working on?
raj Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom.
amy That’s sweet.
raj Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.
penny What’s going on with them?
raj They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
bernadette Hi.
penny Hey, guys.
amy Hello.
howard Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.
bernadette Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.
howard Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
raj I didn’t know you were coming again.
howard Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.
penny It was not funny.
amy So, what tools did you bring?
howard Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.
penny Ooh, that looks like fun.
bernadette Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
howard Okay, who’s up first?
amy Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?
raj No, thanks.
howard I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet.
leonard Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.
arthur This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.
leonard Oh, God.
arthur What, what is it?
leonard Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
arthur Can, can I ask you a question?
leonard Yeah, sure.
arthur Why do you put up with Sheldon?
leonard Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends.
arthur Why?
leonard Wow, you ask really hard questions.
arthur Yeah.
leonard Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.
arthur You, you know you’re describing a dog.
leonard He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…
arthur Yeah, they, they hate that.
leonard You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.
arthur Why, why is that?
leonard Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.
arthur Another photo from Sheldon?
leonard No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
arthur He probably stole his wallet, too.
howard You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.
penny Oh, that’s amazing,
howard Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.
bernadette He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger.
raj My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
howard Whoa, where is that coming from?
raj I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
penny Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.
howard How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
raj But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
howard Since when can’t you open up with me?
raj There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
howard Buddy, I was just joking around.
raj Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.
howard You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
raj Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
amy They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.
sheldon Arthur?
arthur Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon I’m surprised to see you here.
arthur Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.
sheldon I’ll get Leonard.
arthur No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.
sheldon If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.
arthur No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.
sheldon Thank you. It would be an honour.
arthur Oh. Uh, great.
sheldon Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.
arthur And, what did you think?
sheldon Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.
arthur Mmm. Thank you.
sheldon Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.
arthur Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.
sheldon Can I invite you in for tea?
arthur Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.
penny Hey, Arthur. How are you?
arthur Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt.
howard Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?
raj Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.
howard You didn’t have to do that.
raj Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.
howard Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.
raj Oh gets better.
howard Wow.
raj And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.
sheldon Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?
leonard He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.
sheldon Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.
arthur So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?
penny Sorry, they’re both married.
arthur Good.
penny Mmm.
arthur Hap, hap, happily?
