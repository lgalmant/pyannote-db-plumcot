howard All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.
leonard Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em.
penny Um, I have a question.
leonard Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.
howard Unless you have the carrot power.
penny Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?
howard Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
leonard Just play a potion card.
penny Which one?
sheldon It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
leonard Sheldon, don’t ruin the game.
penny How could he ruin the game?
sheldon Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.
leonard See? Ruined.
penny Sheldon, that is incredible.
sheldon From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
leonard Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
sheldon Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
howard Well, I guess game’s over.
penny Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.
leonard Why?
penny Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
howard Not Ka. Ka-ah.
penny Ba-eye.
leonard See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
raj Nobody can.
howard That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.
leonard What?
howard You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.
leonard Yeah, I don’t remember that.
sheldon June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.
leonard Oh, yeah.
howard So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?
leonard Howard, you can’t hold me to that.
howard Why not?
leonard Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.
raj Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?
sheldon You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
raj Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?
howard Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works.
raj Damn.
leonard Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?
sheldon I’m sorry, no.
leonard But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
sheldon Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today. Good luck. That’s the face napkin.
howard So, have you talked to Penny yet?
leonard No, I haven’t.
howard Why not?
leonard Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to.
howard Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.
leonard It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?
howard Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.
raj It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing.
howard Leonard, come on.
leonard Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
howard A hot friend.
leonard Right.
howard And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
leonard I’ll see what I can do.
raj Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?
sheldon I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.
raj Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
sheldon That would probably save us some time.
raj Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable.
sheldon I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
raj What about the money?
sheldon I have money.
raj But this is other money.
sheldon How does it different from the money I have?
raj Half of it will be mine.
sheldon Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
raj Leonard, help.
leonard Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
penny Wow, you really are a genius.
leonard Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?
penny You mean, like a pinky swear?
leonard Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.
penny Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?
leonard Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.
penny Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.
leonard Over puppets?
penny The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.
leonard Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
penny Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
leonard No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
penny And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
leonard Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…
penny I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
leonard Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy.
penny The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.
leonard Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
penny Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
sheldon Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
stuart Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine’s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?
sheldon Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
stuart All right, I won’t set one aside for you.
sheldon But I must have it.
stuart Okay, I’ll set one aside for you.
sheldon Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.
raj Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
stuart Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
sheldon Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
stuart Oh, I’m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
sheldon You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
raj Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.
sheldon I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
raj Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
sheldon My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
raj Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
sheldon It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
raj Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here.
sheldon In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.
raj No doubt, sign here.
sheldon From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.
stuart All right, Raj, looks like you’re teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.
howard So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.
penny She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her.
howard Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
penny No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.
howard Good, good.
penny I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…
howard Six if you count Klingon.
leonard Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?
penny Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
howard What?
penny I’m kidding.
leonard Another delightful surprise for her.
raj Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon.
sheldon My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
raj Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!
sheldon Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!
raj You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.
sheldon Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
raj Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship.
sheldon So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.
raj Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame.
sheldon Silence!
howard So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you studying?
bernadette Microbiology.
howard Oh, cool. So you could study me.
bernadette I don’t understand.
howard Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
bernadette I know, I’m studying it.
howard And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living thing. It’s a joke.
bernadette Are you sure?
howard Do you like science-fiction?
bernadette No.
howard Role-playing games?
bernadette Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
howard Either.
bernadette No.
leonard Gonna be a long night.
penny Yeah, well, it’s your fault.
leonard I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
howard You like magic?
bernadette Not really.
howard Okay.
leonard Long, long night.
sheldon I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’
wil_wheaton Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?
stuart I believe so.
wil_wheaton What is wrong with him?
stuart Everyone has a different theory.
howard How about computers? Do you like computers?
bernadette I use them. I don’t like them.
howard Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
bernadette A puppy once bit my face.
howard Of course it did.
leonard How about that? Einstein was wrong.
penny What?
leonard Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
howard Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother.
bernadette Are you going to answer it?
howard I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.
bernadette I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
howard Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
bernadette Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?
howard My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
bernadette Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?
howard You live with your mother?
bernadette No. That’s the sad part.
howard Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children.
bernadette That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
howard Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?
bernadette Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
howard Corolla!
bernadette Oh!
howard More wine?
bernadette I’d love some.
howard Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
bernadette Why?
howard A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.
bernadette Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
howard It’s a date.
penny Am I a matchmaker or what?
raj Lava serpent.
stuart Nest of snakes.
wil_wheaton Underworld guardian.
sheldon Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
wil_wheaton Invisibility spell.
sheldon Luminescence spell.
wil_wheaton Water nymph.
sheldon Fire demon.
wil_wheaton Two-headed tiger.
sheldon Three-headed lion.
wil_wheaton Sulphur.
sheldon Brimstone.
raj Problem, Wil Wheaton?
wil_wheaton Hang on.
sheldon You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.
wil_wheaton I think he’s got me.
sheldon The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.
wil_wheaton What?
sheldon You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.
wil_wheaton You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.
sheldon Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
wil_wheaton Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I disappointed you.
sheldon No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.
wil_wheaton It’s special relationship, isn’t it, between a boy and his grandmother?
sheldon Oh, yes.
raj Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!
wil_wheaton It’s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.
raj What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart, stab at him!
sheldon I can’t.
raj Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
sheldon No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
raj No! Not enchanted bunny!
wil_wheaton I call my mee-maw nana. And she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.
sheldon I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
wil_wheaton Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let’s get our prize money.
stuart That was fun.
sheldon Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
