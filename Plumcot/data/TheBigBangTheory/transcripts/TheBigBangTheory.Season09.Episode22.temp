penny Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.
leonard That sounds fun.
penny Mm-hmm.
leonard How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
howard ‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.
sheldon Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.
amy But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
sheldon I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember.
penny All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.
raj I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
leonard I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
amy Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
sheldon Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.
amy Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now.
sheldon I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
amy And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
penny The little choo-choo for toddlers?
amy And now you know why I needed the massage.
howard Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.
bernadette It’s okay, you should go.
howard You sure?
bernadette Of course.
penny Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
sheldon Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.
bernadette Me? How? Why?
sheldon Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.
bernadette Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know.
sheldon Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to.
leonard The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.
bernadette I guess we could give it a try.
sheldon Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.
howard I bet you’d like a drink right now.
raj Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?
leonard Sure. I’d like to meet her.
raj Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
sheldon Oh, but I won’t be there.
raj Funny how that worked out.
leonard Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?
raj No, I’m still dating her.
leonard Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?
raj They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions.
sheldon You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
leonard Who’s Frank and Alicia?
sheldon You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?
howard Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.
sheldon I am going to record this for posterity.
leonard All right, here goes nothing.
sheldon Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
leonard Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.
sheldon Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.
raj It’s, it’s beautiful.
howard Actually, it’s making me dizzy.
leonard Good, it’s not just me.
claire Hello.
raj Hey, Claire.
claire Hey, what’s up?
raj Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
claire Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step.
raj Why would it be too big a step?
claire I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird.
raj Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
claire Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?
raj Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.
penny Hey, you ready to go?
leonard Hang on.
penny What are you doing?
leonard Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.
penny You actually smell the wine?
leonard I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
penny Are your sinuses acting up?
leonard Since my preschool got a bunny.
penny Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
sheldon Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
penny Oh, good for you.
sheldon Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
penny No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
sheldon Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.
leonard Okay, have fun.
sheldon Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.
leonard We’re leaving now!
sheldon Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.
penny Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.
sheldon Boy, do I love restrictions.
howard Hey. Where is everybody?
amy Oh, we’re the first ones here.
howard Oh. Cool.
amy Yeah. Cool.
howard You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.
amy Oh, I do. It was three years ago.
howard Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.
amy So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.
howard I know. What are they gonna talk about?
amy I don’t know. I really don’t know.
leonard Hey.
howard Oh, good.
amy Oh, thank God.
penny You guys been here long?
howard No, two minutes.
amy But yes.
howard Where’s Claire?
raj Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.
leonard Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?
raj Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma.
amy Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?
penny Oh, yeah.
amy Are you gonna say hi to him?
penny Uh, I don’t know.
raj Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.
bernadette I brought sparkling cider.
sheldon Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.
bernadette So what do you want to do tonight?
sheldon Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.
bernadette There’s more than one?
sheldon You’ve heard of French toast?
bernadette Yeah.
sheldon Cinnamon toast?
bernadette Yeah.
sheldon Melba toast?
bernadette Yeah.
sheldon You get where I’m going here?
bernadette Yeah.
amy I’m getting an earthy note.
penny Ah, there’s definitely some oak.
raj Also, uh, cherries?
leonard I smell nothing.
howard Really? Nothing?
leonard Just a whole lot of Afrin.
zack Penny?
penny Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.
howard Yeah, hey, buddy.
amy Hello.
raj Hey.
zack Hey, did you two get married?
penny We did.
leonard Yeah, mm-hmm.
zack To each other?
penny Yes.
zack Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.
leonard Thanks.
zack So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?
howard We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
leonard But we won’t bore you with the details.
zack Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.
amy Mike deGrasse Tyson?
howard Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.
zack So what’s your invention?
howard Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.
leonard What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
zack Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.
howard You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever.
zack Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?
howard Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.
leonard And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
zack Is it better than the one they use now?
howard A lot.
leonard Way better.
zack Huh. You sure you guys are smart?
sheldon H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220.
bernadette I’m sorry, I have to ask.
sheldon When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.
bernadette What is it about trains that you like so much?
sheldon What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.
bernadette That’s lovely, Sheldon.
sheldon Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.
leonard I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.
howard Me, too.
leonard Why didn’t you say something?
howard Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.
raj You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
amy It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
penny E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.
amy How do you know that?
penny Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.
claire Hey, Raj.
raj Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.
leonard Would you like a glass of wine?
raj I said no questions.
sheldon And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.
bernadette Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
sheldon You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
bernadette Okay, but just for a little bit.
sheldon Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.
bernadette All right.
sheldon Ready?
bernadette You bet.
sheldon Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall.
bernadette Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
sheldon I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.
bernadette This is getting fun. What’s next?
sheldon You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.
bernadette Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.
sheldon What do you do?
bernadette I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.
sheldon He wants to see I.D.
amy So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you.
claire Really? Like what?
amy Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them.
zack Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.
raj Zack, this is my friend Claire.
zack You’re hot. You seeing anybody?
raj Uh, she’s seeing me.
zack Why’d you say she’s your friend?
raj We’re just keeping it casual.
zack Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.
claire I don’t know. Ask him.
zack Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.
leonard Maybe we should take a step back.
howard Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.
leonard No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.
howard But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.
leonard What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
howard Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.
leonard How?
howard Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
leonard Very funny.
howard You got something better?
leonard Well, not really.
howard Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?
leonard Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.
sheldon The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?
bernadette Does it have eyes?
sheldon Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.
bernadette I stab it in the middle eye.
sheldon Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.
bernadette Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
sheldon Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.
bernadette Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.
sheldon Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.
bernadette Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.
sheldon I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius.
bernadette Well, thanks again.
sheldon You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.
bernadette I might just take you up on that.
sheldon Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.
raj Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire.
zack What are you talking about?
raj I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me.
zack Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.
raj Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
zack Anything for you, my little foreign friend.
claire So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?
penny Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.
leonard I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.
howard Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
zack I see what you’re saying. She’s not so great.
raj Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.
zack Polo.
raj So, uh, what are you guys talking about?
claire Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating.
raj Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
penny We didn’t.
amy You just did.
zack Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.
leonard Morning.
sheldon Morning.
leonard Ugh. Too much wine.
sheldon Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
leonard Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?
sheldon Of course.
leonard Does it bother you?
sheldon No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.
leonard Who are these people?
sheldon Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.
