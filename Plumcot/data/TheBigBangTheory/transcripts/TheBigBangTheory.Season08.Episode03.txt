howard_wolowitz So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.
howard_wolowitz All right.
raj_koothrappali You suck, Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz What’s that about?
raj_koothrappali I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.
sheldon_cooper He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck.
penny Hi. What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Baseball.
penny Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.
leonard_hofstadter He’s practicing.
penny For what?
howard_wolowitz The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?
penny What, you? Really?
howard_wolowitz Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me.
penny That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
sheldon_cooper Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
penny I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
leonard_hofstadter C’mon now, throw one.
howard_wolowitz All right, here we go.
raj_koothrappali You look like a jackass.
howard_wolowitz Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.
leonard_hofstadter Now you know why we’re not outside.
sheldon_cooper Did you enjoy my lecture?
amy_farrah_fowler No, and neither did our waiter.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
penny Hey, how was dinner?
sheldon_cooper Good, I had Cornish game hen.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that poor waiter.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?
penny You guys are going out two nights in a row?
sheldon_cooper I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.
penny That’s so hot.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s better than hot, it’s binding.
sheldon_cooper If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date.
penny Aw.
amy_farrah_fowler You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t believe you’re sore.
howard_wolowitz Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.
bernadette_rostenkowski But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.
howard_wolowitz For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
howard_wolowitz They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.
howard_wolowitz Thank you, that would be great.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong with the way I run?
penny Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.
sheldon_cooper At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.
amy_farrah_fowler I then suggested a pub.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.
amy_farrah_fowler After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.
leonard_hofstadter Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
sheldon_cooper Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours.
penny Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
sheldon_cooper I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t honestly think that, do you?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.
leonard_hofstadter There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.
penny Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
leonard_hofstadter That’s the part you have a problem with?
penny Relax.
amy_farrah_fowler There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.
raj_koothrappali So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?
howard_wolowitz Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.
howard_wolowitz Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?
bernadette_rostenkowski Keep going.
howard_wolowitz How about now?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll let you know.
howard_wolowitz Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, stop.
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding me?!
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s sixty feet.
howard_wolowitz There’s no way this is sixty feet.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m looking at it.
howard_wolowitz You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?
sheldon_cooper For starters, we enjoy spending time together.
leonard_hofstadter So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
sheldon_cooper It’s called parallel play.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, toddlers do that.
sheldon_cooper Not as well as we do.
leonard_hofstadter You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
penny So what? Why do you even care?
sheldon_cooper Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
sheldon_cooper If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.
howard_wolowitz That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with.
raj_koothrappali Come on Howard, fire it in.
bernadette_rostenkowski Throw the damn ball!
amy_farrah_fowler So when do you guys plan on getting married?
penny Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.
sheldon_cooper May I have one of your fries?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
sheldon_cooper Absolutely not.
leonard_hofstadter Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.
sheldon_cooper It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
leonard_hofstadter I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
sheldon_cooper Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.
leonard_hofstadter How ridiculous is he?
penny A hundred.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.
sheldon_cooper No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig.
penny Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.
sheldon_cooper Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.
penny Oh, what did those rascals do now?
amy_farrah_fowler They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.
leonard_hofstadter So, this is accurate?
sheldon_cooper It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.
penny Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.
sheldon_cooper Kind of? It does it perfectly.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. We’ll take it right now.
penny No, don’t.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Just don’t take it.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
penny ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?
leonard_hofstadter Come on. It’ll be fun.
penny I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.
bernadette_rostenkowski Think he’s getting any better?
raj_koothrappali Yup.
howard_wolowitz That was a close one.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
raj_koothrappali Is it too late for him to cancel?
bernadette_rostenkowski I think so.
howard_wolowitz Heads up! Watch out!
leonard_hofstadter Are you mad at me?
penny No, stop being stupid.
leonard_hofstadter Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?
penny Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.
leonard_hofstadter What are you worried about?
penny That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that scares me, too.
penny It does?
leonard_hofstadter Sometimes.
penny Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.
mike_massimino Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?
howard_wolowitz Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?
mike_massimino Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?
howard_wolowitz Why shouldn’t I do it?
mike_massimino There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.
howard_wolowitz But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?
mike_massimino That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.
howard_wolowitz Well, maybe I’ll do a good job.
mike_massimino I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.
howard_wolowitz Okay, thanks for the pep talk.
mike_massimino Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s so nice.
penny Hey, sorry about that.
amy_farrah_fowler No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.
sheldon_cooper Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.
leonard_hofstadter I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
sheldon_cooper The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.
leonard_hofstadter I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
penny Let’s just take the test.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, I don’t want to.
penny Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.
leonard_hofstadter Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
sheldon_cooper Or a one. A one is possible.
leonard_hofstadter Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.
penny Leonard.
amy_farrah_fowler It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
sheldon_cooper We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy.
raj_koothrappali Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.
penny Look at you, talking sports.
leonard_hofstadter This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.
sheldon_cooper Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what did you expect?
sheldon_cooper I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.
sheldon_cooper Who’s the bobblehead of?
amy_farrah_fowler Does it matter?
sheldon_cooper No, as long as it bobbles.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, I am so proud of you.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 You ready?
howard_wolowitz Let’s do it.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 All right.
howard_wolowitz Wish me luck.
bernadette_rostenkowski Go get ’em.
stadium_announcer Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Thank you. Thank you.
penny Can he really throw a ball?
leonard_hofstadter On our Quidditch team, he…
penny Yeah, that’s a no.
howard_wolowitz I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why is it going so slow?
howard_wolowitz ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.
sheldon_cooper Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.
howard_wolowitz Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about Mars.
man_in_crowd#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 You suck, Wolowitz!
sheldon_cooper He makes a valid point.
howard_wolowitz Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster.
