penny Hey, how are things going with your parents?
sheldon You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.
penny You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon.
amy Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?
howard Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
sheldon Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire.
raj Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
amy If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.
raj That would be nice.
amy I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
sheldon Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.
amy You’re going.
sheldon Why do you hate me?
amy I don’t hate you. I love you.
sheldon Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.
raj Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
bernadette I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
howard I agree.
leonard Why not?
penny Me, too.
raj You guys suck.
leonard You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen.
howard We should get going to Amy’s.
leonard Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
howard I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty.
leonard Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
howard How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
leonard You shut the loading doors, right?
howard I thought you did.
leonard Do you know what a disaster this is?
howard You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?
leonard What do we do? Should we call someone?
howard And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
leonard Okay, how do we catch it?
howard Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.
leonard It’s not a moth.
howard Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
leonard Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?
howard Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do.
penny So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?
dr_koothrappali Twenty hours.
penny Oh, that’s rough.
dr_koothrappali Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?
raj Can we please talk about anything else?
dr_koothrappali Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?
penny Oh, great. Everything’s good.
dr_koothrappali I see you got engaged.
penny Yes, we did.
dr_koothrappali Let me tell you a story.
raj Dad.
dr_koothrappali Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other.
raj Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.
amy What’s going on?
raj There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
dr_koothrappali You want me to come?
raj Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
dr_koothrappali Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.
penny You’re just gonna leave him here?
dr_koothrappali Relax, he says.
raj Yup. Bye.
bernadette Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.
sheldon Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
bernadette Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?
sheldon Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
bernadette Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
sheldon My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
bernadette Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
sheldon Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.
bernadette Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
sheldon Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
bernadette She’s just excited about the holidays.
sheldon Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.
bernadette How?
sheldon Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.
bernadette What?
sheldon I’m going to buy her a present.
bernadette Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.
sheldon With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.
bernadette Then you’re both sad?
sheldon Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
bernadette So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
sheldon That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.
howard Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.
leonard A Slim Jim?
howard It’s all I could find. It’ll work.
leonard Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
howard Okay, well, what’s your plan?
leonard I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.
howard And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
leonard No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.
howard Why do you keep assuming it was me?
leonard Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.
howard Like when?
leonard What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?
howard Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.
leonard Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
howard Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
leonard I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
raj Hey, what’s going on?
leonard Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
raj Should have put it in the bag first.
penny So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?
dr_koothrappali It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?
penny No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
amy Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.
penny Like what?
amy Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.
penny Sorry. She’s taken, too.
howard You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
leonard And you found somebody you could push around?
raj Hey.
howard Stay out of this.
raj Okay.
howard You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me.
raj Actually.
howard I said, stay out of it.
leonard No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
raj All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.
howard Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.
raj No, you’re the one who let him in.
howard How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?
raj Come on.
bernadette What about that sweater?
sheldon No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.
bernadette I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.
sheldon Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.
bernadette Wow, you really do love her.
sheldon I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
amy You won.
penny Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?
dr_koothrappali You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.
penny Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.
dr_koothrappali Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
penny Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
santa All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?
sheldon Correct.
santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
sheldon There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
photographer Smile.
santa Ho, ho. ho.
leonard Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
howard Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
leonard Do you want the fire extinguisher?
howard Yeah, I do.
leonard Great. Here you go.
howard Okay. One, two, three.
raj Uh, you have to take the pin out.
leonard You miss the blanket now, don’t you?
howard On three. One, two, three.
raj What did you do?
howard It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
leonard Relax, it wasn’t your fault.
howard Uh, maybe it’s just stunned.
raj Dude, it’s not breathing.
howard Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.
raj What do you mean, not again?
howard When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.
leonard Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
howard Great. Do it.
leonard I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
raj I’ll do it.
howard No. I need to do it. This is on me.
leonard Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
raj Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.
leonard Anything?
howard I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
leonard Wait, wait, his wing moved.
howard Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.
raj It’s a Christmas miracle.
howard I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain.
raj Someone should really close that loading door.
raj Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
howard You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.
leonard No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.
raj Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.
leonard Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?
penny It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?
leonard I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
penny Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?
leonard No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.
penny So erase them and walk out.
leonard I can’t do that.
howard Can’t do what?
leonard She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
howard We can’t do that.
leonard Yeah.
leonard_howard_and_raj Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.
raj Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.
sheldon If you like raisins.
amy Thank you. And it’s figs.
sheldon Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.
bernadette You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
howard It smelled too much like blue jay.
dr_koothrappali Can I help you clean up?
amy Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.
sheldon Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?
penny Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.
leonard I thought you hate giving gifts.
sheldon Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
amy You got me something?
sheldon Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
amy Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.
sheldon Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
amy No, I love it.
sheldon Oh, really? Well, how about now? Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.
amy Actually, I did get you something.
sheldon But what about our agreement?
amy Well, you got me something. Here.
sheldon Cookies?
amy They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
sheldon They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
amy Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
sheldon I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.
amy Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
penny Of course it is.
amy One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
raj If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy.
