leonard_hofstadter I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
sheldon_cooper That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you say that?
sheldon_cooper You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.
leonard_hofstadter That was a huge spoiler.
sheldon_cooper Good.
leonard_hofstadter What is wrong with you? If I did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
leonard_hofstadter Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
sheldon_cooper Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.
leonard_hofstadter You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating.
sheldon_cooper There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving my point, little lady.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
sheldon_cooper What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. You’re impossible.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it. I don’t, I don’t have to put up with this.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.
leonard_hofstadter Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.
sheldon_cooper You pick that up right now.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.
sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
leonard_hofstadter To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.
sheldon_cooper Crazy bastard?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
raj_koothrappali Here you go.
howard_wolowitz Great. Come on in.
raj_koothrappali What, you don’t say thank you?
howard_wolowitz It’s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.
raj_koothrappali Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?
howard_wolowitz No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It’s part of a bonus she got.
raj_koothrappali Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
howard_wolowitz Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
raj_koothrappali Is there a good anal leakage?
howard_wolowitz Anyway, it was Bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.
raj_koothrappali Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I got a favour to ask.
raj_koothrappali Sure.
howard_wolowitz My mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
raj_koothrappali Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.
howard_wolowitz She’s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay.
raj_koothrappali Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
howard_wolowitz Really? What do you got going on?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.
howard_wolowitz I told her around seven.
leonard_hofstadter I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.
penny Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live with him for one more minute.
penny Wow. Where are you going to go?
leonard_hofstadter I was thinking here with you.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter That a problem?
penny No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.
leonard_hofstadter He’s got Amy now.
penny Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
penny Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?
leonard_hofstadter Harry and Ginny get together?
penny Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.
leonard_hofstadter Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.
penny Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
penny No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really big step.
leonard_hofstadter Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?
penny Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny I got nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Great. I’ll go get my stuff.
penny Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.
penny Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.
debbie_wolowitz Are you ready for dessert?
raj_koothrappali No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.
debbie_wolowitz Oh, please. You’re a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.
raj_koothrappali Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
debbie_wolowitz The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?
raj_koothrappali That would be lovely. Thank you. Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?
debbie_wolowitz Don’t mind me. I just cry when I’m lonely and have nothing to live for.
raj_koothrappali I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
debbie_wolowitz Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?
raj_koothrappali Sure.
debbie_wolowitz I’ll make one.
sheldon_cooper One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s Leonard’s.
amy_farrah_fowler Children’s toy.
amy_farrah_fowler Children’s toy.
sheldon_cooper One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it.
amy_farrah_fowler So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?
sheldon_cooper Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.
amy_farrah_fowler Like a dog-boy.
sheldon_cooper Exactly.
amy_farrah_fowler What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
sheldon_cooper That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.
amy_farrah_fowler Great. Here I am!
sheldon_cooper Wait. Here who is where?
amy_farrah_fowler Me. Aren’t I your perfect roommate?
sheldon_cooper Um…
amy_farrah_fowler Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?
sheldon_cooper Um…
amy_farrah_fowler Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
sheldon_cooper Um…
amy_farrah_fowler See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
sheldon_cooper Um…
sheldon_cooper Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want?
sheldon_cooper Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Is that so?
sheldon_cooper Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
leonard_hofstadter Cut to the chase, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of product.
penny Hey. What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.
penny Really? Interesting.
leonard_hofstadter Well, too late, pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?
penny It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for.
penny Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine.
leonard_hofstadter Well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.
penny Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
sheldon_cooper Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn’t refute.
penny That is the worst, isn’t it?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?
sheldon_cooper Um…
raj_koothrappali Hello?
howard_wolowitz Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?
raj_koothrappali Okay, I guess.
howard_wolowitz What time did you leave?
raj_koothrappali Actually, I’m still here.
howard_wolowitz What? You spent the night?
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.
howard_wolowitz You wore my pyjamas?
raj_koothrappali Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.
debbie_wolowitz Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?
raj_koothrappali Oh, boy. Breakfast.
howard_wolowitz Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.
raj_koothrappali But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
howard_wolowitz If you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Howard, stop.
howard_wolowitz Trust me, you’re not Jewish. That’s how they get you.
raj_koothrappali You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
howard_wolowitz Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?
raj_koothrappali They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey.
sheldon_cooper Hello, home wrecker.
penny What did I do?
sheldon_cooper You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
penny Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with me.
sheldon_cooper Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
penny No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
sheldon_cooper You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
penny Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.
sheldon_cooper Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why don’t you just tell him?
penny Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.
sheldon_cooper That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
penny Well, I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
sheldon_cooper I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.
penny Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
howard_wolowitz Here’s some more ice.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thanks.
howard_wolowitz What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.
bernadette_rostenkowski Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
howard_wolowitz Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
bernadette_rostenkowski If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Raj. What’s up?
raj_koothrappali You were right. I can’t get out of here.
howard_wolowitz You’re still at my mother’s?
raj_koothrappali I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?
howard_wolowitz Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.
raj_koothrappali Come on, Howard, help me.
debbie_wolowitz Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God. She’s not gonna bathe me, is she?
howard_wolowitz Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.
raj_koothrappali But, Howard…
bernadette_rostenkowski Should we go back and rescue him?
howard_wolowitz It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
amy_farrah_fowler Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
sheldon_cooper Is it kung pao chicken?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Brown rice, not white rice?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes. I did good, right?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, why would you?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.
sheldon_cooper Hello. This is Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler And this is Amy.
sheldon_cooper We’re not home right now.
amy_farrah_fowler ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 Leave a message.
amy_farrah_fowler Beep.
sheldon_cooper You can’t live here.
amy_farrah_fowler What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.
sheldon_cooper No. It’s not the message.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.
sheldon_cooper You did.
amy_farrah_fowler Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t live here.
sheldon_cooper It’s Penny’s fault.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
sheldon_cooper She doesn’t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the reason we can’t be happy.
penny Hey, Ames.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Sheldon, what did you say?
sheldon_cooper I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard, and you know it.
leonard_hofstadter Since when don’t you want to live with me?
penny Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I think we should talk about that.
penny And since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
sheldon_cooper I thought we were talking about the other thing.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re a coward.
sheldon_cooper Well, the evidence does support that.
penny Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.
penny Um…
sheldon_cooper Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
leonard_hofstadter ‘Kay.
sheldon_cooper Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.
debbie_wolowitz Where you going?
raj_koothrappali No!
