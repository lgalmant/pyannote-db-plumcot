sheldon How much will it hurt?
amy It’s just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
sheldon On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.
amy A two.
sheldon Eating a whole Altoid?
amy Sheldon, if I’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, I’ve done this dozens of times, but if you’re too scared you don’t have to.
sheldon No, this is for science. I can be brave for science.
amy Thank you.
sheldon Oh, jiminy, that’s cold.
amy Just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when I’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
sheldon All right, just warn me before you do it.
amy Okay. Three, two, and we’re done.
sheldon You tricked me. You didn’t say one.
amy It didn’t hurt, did it?
sheldon No, but three, two and we’re done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. It’s like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yelling…
amy Okay, fine, one.
sheldon Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
raj Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. That’s definitely a gravitational wobble.
cleaner Uh, sorry, I could come back.
raj Oh, no, it’s okay. I just found a wobble.
cleaner Oh, do I need a mop?
raj It’s a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
cleaner Oh, well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?
raj Yeah, but it’s probably difficult to pronounce.
cleaner What is your name?
cleaner You think it would be more difficult than that?
raj Good point. And you are?
cleaner Oh, uh, Isabella Maria Concepcion.
raj Oh, well, nice to meet you.
isabella Nice to meet you, too. You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, working here was ten years old.
raj Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.
isabella Bueno, um, I’m just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I’ll get out of your way.
raj Oh, please, allow me. That’s a lot of empty calories.
isabella Thank you.
raj You’re welcome.
isabella Okay, uh, okay, I have to go.
raj Okay.
isabella Good luck with your, um, space exploration.
raj Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
sheldon Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?
amy If you’d give me a minute, I’ll tell you.
sheldon Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, they’re so thick and beautiful.
amy Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.
sheldon I have such a profound sense of creation. I, it’s like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys.
amy These cells come from both of us.
sheldon Yeah, but us monkeys doesn’t pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?
amy No reason we can’t start right now.
sheldon What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, let’s
amy Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, it’s remarkable, but it’s still limited in what it can do.
sheldon I understand. She’s the mean one, I’m the fun one.
howard Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.
raj Oh, no, that’s mine.
leonard Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
raj Well, I can’t eat like a ten-year-old all the time.
penny You’re dating somebody, who is it?
raj What? What are you talking about?
penny You only watch what you eat when you’re afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
howard No, she’s right. As long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been self-conscious about your cleavage.
raj That’s because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
penny All right, fine, don’t tell us.
raj There’s nothing to tell.
penny All right.
leonard How’s that broccoli?
raj It’s gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
penny Bam. Thank you. What’s her name?
raj Isabella.
howard Oh, did you meet her at work?
raj Yes, in the telescope room.
leonard Oh, so she’s an astronomer?
raj Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good.
penny Well, that’s great, Raj. You must have so much in common.
raj Mm-hmm.
howard So, when do we meet her?
raj No, no, this is brand new. We haven’t even been on a proper date yet.
leonard Okay, well, good luck with it.
raj Thank you.
penny How come you never eat broccoli?
leonard I’m married, I don’t have to be attractive.
amy You know, most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years.
bernadette Still, I can’t believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.
amy Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky’s the limit.
sheldon Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.
bernadette Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you.
sheldon Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy’s lab.
bernadette I’m running out of ways to act excited.
amy So, enough about us, how are things going with you?
bernadette Great, the doctor said the baby’s head is facing down now.
amy Good, you know, in case the exit isn’t clearly marked.
sheldon Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.
bernadette Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
sheldon Well, I didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.
bernadette You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
sheldon Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.
bernadette Mine has a fully developed immune system.
sheldon Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
amy Sheldon, that’s enough.
sheldon Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.
raj This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
isabella You’re kidding.
raj No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.
isabella It’s okay, you’re allowed to have a cleaning lady.
raj Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.
isabella I think that’s called a mommy.
raj Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?
isabella No, not for many years.
raj Oh, so, you are unencumbered?
isabella Just me and my son.
raj I love kids, how old is he?
isabella Nineteen.
raj That’s a cute age. They can do so many things.
isabella He’s studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.
raj That’s wonderful. A lawyer, my sister’s a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common.
isabella Yeah, I guess we do.
raj Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?
isabella Ay, Rajesh, I think you’re very sweet, but I work two jobs and I don’t have time for dating.
raj Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I’m very busy, too.
isabella Oh, please don’t take it personal, I think you’re a very nice man.
raj I think you’re very nice as well.
isabella Thank you for helping me. Good night, Rajesh.
raj Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.
isabella Good night, Rajesh.
raj Okay. I’ll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, I’ll be thinking of you.
sheldon Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it.
amy I’ve never seen results like this before.
sheldon Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge.
amy Aren’t you glad you participated in this?
sheldon Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?
amy Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
sheldon Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.
amy Make a baby? What are you talking about?
sheldon Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. We’ll be able to get into any preschool we want!
amy Sheldon, I’m not ready to have a baby.
sheldon Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours you’re as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.
amy Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.
sheldon I don’t understand. I thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me.
amy Not right now.
sheldon Oh, I see what’s happening here. You’re playing hard to get.
amy I’m not playing anything. We’re not making a baby today.
sheldon Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?
raj Welcome.
isabella What is this?
raj Oh, well, you said you didn’t have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.
isabella Oh, Rajesh.
raj Oh, come on, we’re in the telescope room. It’ll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means it’s twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while.
isabella Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you, you know I’m working.
raj That’s why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
isabella Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.
raj Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.
isabella Oh, really? You made Cuban food?
raj That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?
penny Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?
amy No. He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.
leonard Why does he need a baby? He’s already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
penny Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
amy Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn’t guarantee anything.
leonard That’s true. Sheldon’s father once picked a fight with a cactus.
penny Yeah, but that’s just his Earth parents. We don’t know anything about the ones that sent him here.
leonard Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.
amy Hey, you’re talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man.
penny Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.
leonard Well, have fun with whatever nightmare’s behind door number two.
sheldon Well, hello.
amy Hello.
sheldon Would you care for a brandy?
amy I don’t think so.
sheldon Good choice, it’s disgusting.
amy Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.
sheldon Who’s trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
amy I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
sheldon Anything you’d like to pet? Not my hair. There’s a lot of goop in it.
amy Okay, I’ve had enough.
sheldon Amy, come back. I don’t know how to open the oysters.
raj So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?
isabella Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah’s favourite things.
raj I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.
isabella You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you’d like to…
howard Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
raj Uh.
isabella It’s okay. Uh, I should get back to work.
howard Hi. Howard Wolowitz.
isabella Oh. Isabella Concepcion.
howard Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper.
isabella You told him I was an astronomer?
raj Uh.
isabella I understand. Time to go.
raj No, p-please don’t.
isabella It’s okay, Rajesh, I’m a grown woman. I don’t have to waste my time with someone who’s embarrassed by me.
howard I can keep this, right?
raj Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.
isabella If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?
raj I’m sorry. Honestly, I didn’t think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But there’s a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.
isabella I doubt that.
raj Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know they’re pretty, but I’m scared of butterflies.
howard Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart.
raj Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
isabella You’re very persistent.
raj It’s my one move.
isabella Okay. This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.
raj Great. Where would you like to go?
isabella Your choice. It can be Pakistani food if you like.
raj Excuse me, but I’m Indian.
isabella And now you know how it feels.
penny So, were you turned on even a little bit?
amy It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.
leonard I’m sorry, is that a yes?
amy No.
sheldon Amy, I didn’t want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco.
amy For God’s sake, you’re ridiculous.
sheldon You guys are aroused, right?
amy That was a close one.
