penny Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it's called trestling.
howard_wolowitz It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.
penny Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. Right come on guys, come on. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ...
sheldon_cooper We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.
raj_koothrappali Keebler Elf? I've got your Keebler Elf right here. Okay, it's a stalemate.
penny So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
sheldon_cooper He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant.
penny Okay, he can have carrot cake.
sheldon_cooper What about the cream cheese frosting.
penny he can scrape it off.
leonard_hofstadter Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?
penny I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
sheldon_cooper For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.
penny Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don't think so.
penny Why not?
leonard_hofstadter I don't celebrate my birthday.
penny Shuddup, yeah you do.
leonard_hofstadter No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.
penny Uh, that's so silly.
sheldon_cooper It's actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.
penny What was it called, 'I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake?'
sheldon_cooper It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
howard_wolowitz Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom's special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.
penny Yeah, see, that's what kids should have.
howard_wolowitz Actually that was last year.
penny So you've really never had a birthday party?
leonard_hofstadter No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.
penny And?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.
penny Oh my God, that's terrible.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so ...7
penny That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
howard_wolowitz You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.
howard_wolowitz Make sure they remember no peanuts.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. They see me coming they go 'ah, no peanut boy!'
sheldon_cooper Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
penny I know. I want to talk to you.
sheldon_cooper What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.
penny Okay, can you just let me in.
sheldon_cooper Well alright, but I don't see this as a promising endeavour.
penny Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.
sheldon_cooper I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.
howard_wolowitz Did someone say party?
penny He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one.
howard_wolowitz I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.
penny Howard, here's the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.
howard_wolowitz Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?
sheldon_cooper I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
penny Anguish?
sheldon_cooper Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.
penny Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
sheldon_cooper Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.
penny Nevertheless we are ...
sheldon_cooper In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a ...
penny Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
sheldon_cooper You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.
penny Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?
sheldon_cooper Well of course I ... oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let's throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.
sheldon_cooper That's not the secret knock. This is the secret knock.
howard_wolowitz What difference does it make?
sheldon_cooper The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.
penny Is that Raj and Howard?
sheldon_cooper Possibly, but unverified.
howard_wolowitz Can you just let us in.
sheldon_cooper Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
penny So, what did you get the birthday boy?
howard_wolowitz Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.
penny Nice. I got him a sweater.
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, he might like that, I've seen him ... chilly.
penny Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
sheldon_cooper That's because I didn't bring one.
penny Well why not?
howard_wolowitz Don't ask.
sheldon_cooper The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
howard_wolowitz Too late.
sheldon_cooper Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it's a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?
howard_wolowitz Told you not to ask.
penny Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.
sheldon_cooper I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.
howard_wolowitz Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
penny What?
howard_wolowitz Just do it.
penny It's a non-optional social convention.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Fair enough.
howard_wolowitz He came with a manual.
sheldon_cooper Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.
penny Okay, let's do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.
howard_wolowitz No problem.
penny And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.
howard_wolowitz What if guests show up?
penny Entertain them.
howard_wolowitz What if they're women?
penny Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.
howard_wolowitz Hey!
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz How's it going?
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
howard_wolowitz So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.
leonard_hofstadter Seen it.
howard_wolowitz No, you've seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Pass.
howard_wolowitz Come on, afterwards there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there's this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.
howard_wolowitz Can't you play him some other time?
leonard_hofstadter Not if you believe his doctors.
howard_wolowitz Oh my God, do you smell gas.
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, no.
penny Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.
penny Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.
sheldon_cooper You mean, like a sweater?
penny Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print.
sheldon_cooper Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
penny Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.
sheldon_cooper Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
penny Exactly.
sheldon_cooper Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like ... oh, an 802.11n wireless router.
leonard_hofstadter Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. Come on, come on, oh you clever little ... Come on, come on, take that!
howard_wolowitz Oh-oh. Oh-oh!
leonard_hofstadter What's the matter?
howard_wolowitz This granola bar, there's peanuts in it.
leonard_hofstadter Oh my God, why did you eat it?
howard_wolowitz I don't know, it was just there.
leonard_hofstadter Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?
howard_wolowitz Don't yell at me, I've got to go to the emergency room.
leonard_hofstadter Now?
howard_wolowitz No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.
howard_wolowitz Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh ... The laundry is out of the hamper. Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it's out of the washer. I'll call you when it's in the dryer.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, let's go.
sheldon_cooper What do you think.
penny Um, that one.
sheldon_cooper Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper He doesn't need them, he's already got a 640 connect switch
penny Oh, okay then this one.
sheldon_cooper Why?
penny I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy.
sheldon_cooper Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
penny Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?
sheldon_cooper On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.
penny Of course.
sheldon_cooper Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me ... wow, this is hard. They got me ... a motorised dirt bike.
penny No?
sheldon_cooper What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
penny All of them.
sheldon_cooper Really?
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Huh?
penny Okay, so we're getting this one?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I suppose.
penny Okay, let's go.
random_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?
sheldon_cooper I know everything about this stuff.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.
penny Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting, see, happy guy available.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no, she doesn't want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Thank you.
random_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?
sheldon_cooper It depends on what Bus you have.
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 I drive a Chevy Cavalier.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear lord.
penny Sheldon, we have to go.
sheldon_cooper Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. You hold on, I'll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don't say a white one?
howard_wolowitz Excuse me.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Fill this out, have a seat.
howard_wolowitz No, listen, see we're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat.
howard_wolowitz No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I'm allergic to peanuts.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.
howard_wolowitz Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Is that all you need?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Get out of my ER.
howard_wolowitz No, you don't understand.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you to the man who freed your people.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, sorry I couldn't find a parking spot, how are you doing.
howard_wolowitz Bad, very bad.
leonard_hofstadter Really, 'cos you don't look like you're swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.
howard_wolowitz We can't go home.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
howard_wolowitz Becauth Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, I'll be right back.
howard_wolowitz Penny, look, I've got a problem.
penny Yeah, well so do I, look you've got to stall Leonard a little longer.
howard_wolowitz I don't think I can.
penny You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell 'surprise!'
howard_wolowitz Okay, you have to understand something, we're in a hospital right now.
penny Why, is Leonard okay.
howard_wolowitz Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.
penny Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.
howard_wolowitz Look, I've done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.
penny Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.
howard_wolowitz Don't toy with me, woman.
penny I've got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I've got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.
howard_wolowitz Thy will be done. I'm doing this for you, little buddy.
sheldon_cooper Okay, we don't have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.
penny Him.
althea Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.
sheldon_cooper Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.
penny Sheldon, we have to go.
sheldon_cooper Why?
penny Well, for one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.
sheldon_cooper Good luck. By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system.
penny Keep walking.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 No he's not.
leonard_hofstadter Yes he is.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don't ... holy crap!
howard_wolowitz Pees hep me!
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.
howard_wolowitz Fank-u.
leonard_hofstadter Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything.
howard_wolowitz I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.
leonard_hofstadter You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.
howard_wolowitz Oh, right, it's your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it's all over now.
leonard_hofstadter There is a party, isn't there.
howard_wolowitz Maybe.
leonard_hofstadter Howard.
howard_wolowitz Are you mad?
leonard_hofstadter how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, that's why I did it.
leonard_hofstadter Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
raj_koothrappali Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!
raj_koothrappali Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh ... Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off.
penny That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I've got to introduce her to Howard.
raj_koothrappali Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.
penny I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it's okay.
penny Happy birthday anyways.
leonard_hofstadter Hey Penny, when, uh, when's your birthday?
