leonard You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
sheldon You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
leonard Okay, let’s talk about that.
sheldon As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.
leonard We all do. Now, how about dinner?
sheldon Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.
leonard Excuse me.
sheldon Permission granted, Commander.
amy Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.
leonard Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?
penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
leonard No, I mean just you and me.
penny You mean, like a date?
leonard Not like a date, a date.
amy Ooh!
bernadette Ooh!
penny Um, o-okay. Sure.
amy Ooh!
bernadette Ooh!
sheldon Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.
bernadette This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.
amy How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
bernadette Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?
penny Just a sec. Too much?
bernadette Yes.
amy No.
penny Okay, just hang on.
amy You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?
bernadette When did you and Leonard break up?
penny Uh, about two years ago.
bernadette Why do you think he asked you out again?
penny I don’t know.
amy Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.
penny He’s not dying.
amy Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.
penny How about this?
bernadette Maybe.
amy Come on.
penny Yeah, okay, no.
bernadette Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
penny Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.
amy If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
penny What?
amy Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.
penny Okay, he is not dying.
amy How do you know? Are you a doctor?
bernadette You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network.
penny Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.
amy With a dead man.
penny Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.
bernadette Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.
penny I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
amy Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
bernadette Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.
sheldon Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?
leonard Okay, how do I look?
howard Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?
leonard What are you talking about?
raj Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
leonard I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship.
raj I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement.
sheldon You want to know my opinion?
leonard Oh, boy, do I?
sheldon Sarcasm?
howard No.
sheldon All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.
leonard Where on earth did you get that from?
sheldon It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.
leonard That doesn’t make it true.
sheldon It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.
leonard See you later.
raj If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.
howard Why?
raj Because she’s great in everything.
sheldon Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?
leonard So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?
penny Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?
leonard Yeah, that sounds right.
penny Yeah?
leonard Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.
penny Okay.
leonard So, Polly, tell me about yourself.
penny It’s Penny.
leonard Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.
penny Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.
leonard Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
penny Wow. Can they?
leonard Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.
penny Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?
leonard Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.
penny What does that mean?
leonard Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.
penny You are so funny.
leonard Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
penny Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.
leonard Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?
penny Whoa. Not so fast.
leonard I’m sorry, what did I say?
penny Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.
leonard Oh, God.
penny What?
leonard You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.
penny So?
leonard So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.
penny How would you say it?
leonard I have feelings for you.
penny It’s the same thing.
leonard No, it’s not. Always made it worse.
penny You’re overthinking this.
leonard No, I’m not.
penny Yes, you are. You always overthink things.
leonard Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
penny See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.
leonard Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.
penny Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for.
leonard Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.
sheldon And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement.
raj He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
howard Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?
leonard You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
raj I guess it didn’t go well.
sheldon We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
howard How about now?
sheldon Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game.
raj You were in the middle of an erection.
sheldon Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand.
leonard What does she want from me now? What’s up?
penny Do not overthink this.
leonard I don’t understand.
penny Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
leonard Okay, but earlier it seemed like…
penny No talking.
leonard Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
penny Well, that was fun.
leonard Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.
penny You hung in there, though.
leonard Well, there was a lot at stake.
penny So what do you want to do now?
leonard Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?
penny I don’t know, it’s complicated.
leonard Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.
penny Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.
leonard Why? What are you afraid of?
penny Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?
leonard What if I dump you?
penny Come on, be serious.
leonard Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.
penny So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
leonard Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
penny Well, we don’t really have to pretend.
leonard And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
penny Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.
leonard I can’t believe you kept this.
penny Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.
leonard That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
sheldon Leonard?
leonard Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?
sheldon Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?
leonard Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?
sheldon I was using the bathroom.
leonard Yeah, well, so was I.
sheldon Really? I didn’t see you in there.
leonard Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
sheldon Where?
leonard The, the gas station across the street.
sheldon In your pyjamas?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Without shoes?
leonard Yes.
sheldon On a cold winter’s night?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
leonard Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
sheldon Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.
leonard What?
sheldon After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?
leonard What?
sheldon It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?
leonard No.
sheldon Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
leonard I don’t want beef jerky.
sheldon It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
leonard Fine.
sheldon Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.
sheldon Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.
howard Why?
sheldon We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so.
bernadette I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.
amy Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship.
sheldon You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.
leonard We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
sheldon Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine.
howard I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
leonard Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends.
bernadette Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.
howard Why not?
bernadette I’m a very vengeful person.
howard Really?
bernadette With access to weaponised smallpox.
penny Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?
howard Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you.
bernadette Howard.
penny No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.
leonard Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other.
bernadette Oh, that’s nice.
leonard See, she knew what always meant.
penny Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?
leonard I’m just making a point.
penny Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
sheldon People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order.
penny Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right.
leonard Oh, that is not true.
sheldon I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
penny You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.
leonard Well…
sheldon Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.
leonard Unbelievable.
penny Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
leonard Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?
penny No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag.
leonard You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap.
penny The hell do you think you’re going?
leonard Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
penny Yeah, kind of, yeah.
leonard What are we doing?
penny What do you mean?
leonard Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
penny That’s because you overthink everything.
sheldons_voice Leonard, are you listening to me?
leonard What? Yeah.
sheldon This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
leonard I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.
sheldon You’re right, I’ll give him a shot.
leonard Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?
penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
leonard No, I mean just you and me.
amy Ooh!
bernadette Ooh!
penny Uh, have you thought this through?
leonard Yes, and I think we should go anyway.
sheldon No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back.
amy If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.
bernadette What about me and Howard?
amy Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.
bernadette Where are you guys going to eat?
amy Penny?
minister Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?
penny Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?
amy Penny?
penny Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.
