howard Hey, Bernie.
bernadette Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?
howard Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.
bernadette Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home.
howard I know.
bernadette I got to get back to work. I love you.
howard Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?
bernadette What do you want me to do?
howard Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?
bernadette Really, you’re serious? Okay.
howard Oh, baby, you’re killing me.
penny Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.
sheldon Oh, thank you, Penny.
penny M-hmm.
sheldon Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.
penny Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?
leonard Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
sheldon Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.
penny Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
sheldon No, that’s my potty training journal.
penny Really, your potty training journal?
sheldon Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.
penny August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
sheldon There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.
penny Oh, disgusting.
leonard No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.
penny Why do you need all this stuff?
leonard No, no, no, no.
penny Sorry!
sheldon I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
penny Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson.
sheldon Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
penny Yeah, that’s basically what I said.
sheldon Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
leonard I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
penny You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
sheldon Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.
leonard So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
sheldon That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
leonard Not gonna happen.
sheldon Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking.
leonard If you want help, just hire a grad student.
penny Maybe I could do it.
sheldon You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.
penny A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t I?
sheldon You said it, not me.
sheldon All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?
ms_jenson No, thanks. I’m fine.
sheldon Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.
ms_jenson I don’t do drugs.
sheldon Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you’re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss.
ms_jenson No, of course not. How did you know about that?
sheldon I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
ms_jenson Yes, I did.
sheldon Hearing unimpaired, good.
ms_jenson Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.
sheldon Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.
ms_jenson It’s not flattery if it’s the truth.
sheldon Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.
leonard You talk to Howard lately?
raj Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. Hey, Sheldon, hope you’re hungry, they’re serving macaroni and… che-ee-ee-ese.
leonard Smooth. Hi.
ms_jenson Hello.
leonard Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?
sheldon No. I have people for that now. You’re up.
ms_jenson I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s new assistant.
leonard Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.
alex It’s nice to meet you. I’m so excited to be working with Dr…
sheldon Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.
alex I should probably get to work.
leonard She seems nice.
raj Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
leonard All I said was she seems nice.
raj Yeah, well, I love her.
bernadette Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?
howard Uh, no, not really.
bernadette What’s wrong?
howard Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?
bernadette Uh-huh.
howard It’s delayed. We’re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It’s the Russians, so you don’t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.
bernadette Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there.
howard I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I’m down to my last three Tums.
bernadette You’re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
howard Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man.
amy Oh, yeah. I’m a man-eater now.
penny Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.
amy Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist.
penny Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?
amy I’m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room.
alex Dr. Cooper’s office.
amy Oh, hello. Who are you?
alex I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s assistant. Can I help you?
amy I’d like to speak to Sheldon.
alex I’m sorry. He’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.
amy All right. Well, tell him Amy called.
alex Last name?
amy He knows my last name. I’m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I’ll send you a PDF.
alex All right, I will tell him you called.
amy Hmm, that’s weird.
penny What?
amy Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn’t mention that Alex was a girl.
penny Maybe he didn’t notice.
amy You’re right. I don’t have to worry about Sheldon.
penny No, you do not.
amy It’s her I have to worry about.
penny Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.
amy Oh, really? Look at this face How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?
penny Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.
penny Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.
amy I’m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. Aha!
penny Can we go now?
amy Hang on.
penny What are you doing?
amy Isn’t it obvious? I’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.
penny Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.
amy Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.
raj Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?
sheldon Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?
raj I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.
alex Here’s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.
leonard This should be fun.
sheldon Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?
alex Yes.
sheldon Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
alex Rainbow, not chocolate.
sheldon Two cherries?
alex One on top, one on the bottom.
sheldon Stems removed?
alex Um, top one, yes. I didn’t check the one on the bottom.
leonard Oh!
alex I’m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed.
leonard Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?
alex Um…
sheldon Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?
leonard Given her what?
sheldon If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.
leonard What?
sheldon It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.
leonard Oh, sure. Please join us.
alex Oh, okay. Thank you.
leonard So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?
alex I’m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth’s L-Five Lagrange point.
leonard Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.
alex Is that true? Is he all right?
leonard No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity.
alex It’s okay, I’ve been around scientists all my life. My dad’s an astronomer at SETI.
leonard Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.
alex So, what kind of research are you doing?
leonard High-energy lasers.
alex Ooh. Military?
leonard Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
amy You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank’s your problem, not mine.
alex You’re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon Cherry stem! Cherry stem!
bernadette How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?
howard Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
bernadette Okay.
howard Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I’ll leave the door unlocked.
bernadette Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety.
howard No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home.
amy Look at you, putting on a brave face.
penny There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.
amy Really? I don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.
penny Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.
amy So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he’s desirable.
penny Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.
amy So it does bother you.
penny Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.
amy And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.
penny So, how was work today?
leonard Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.
penny Oh! You’re kidding.
leonard No, Raj had to go to the nurse.
penny Wow. Anything else?
leonard Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
penny Oh, is that it?
leonard Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
sheldon Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.
leonard What do you got?
sheldon I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
sheldon The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
alex Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
penny Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny.
alex Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
penny In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
alex Oh. Well, you’re lucky. He seems very talented. And I’m sure a lot of people want to work with him.
penny Well, a lot of people can’t. Uh, hey.
leonard Where are we going?
penny My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
alex She seems nice.
sheldon Notice people on your own time. We’re working.
bernadette Hey, Howie, how you feeling?
howard Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.
bernadette Howie, stop that. NASA’s watching this! Put your pants back on!
howard Whee! Whee!
