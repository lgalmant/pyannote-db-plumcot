leonard They are not.
raj They are, too.
leonard Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
raj No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
leonard Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
raj That’s called a fashion choice.
leonard All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.
sheldon If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.
leonard Good boy. Here’s a cookie.
sheldon Oh, thank you.
howard Hey, fellas, what’s going on?
leonard Oh, mummies and zombies again.
howard Oh, they’re not the same thing.
leonard You get a cookie, too.
howard Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
raj Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
howard Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294.
sheldon I’m sorry, 294?
howard Yeah.
sheldon That’s my parking spot.
raj Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.
sheldon It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.
leonard Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
sheldon Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.
howard Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll give you another parking space.
sheldon I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
howard Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.
sheldon Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
howard Are you listening to yourself?
sheldon I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.
howard Nope.
sheldon Very well. You leave me no choice.
sheldon What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?
sheldon President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university.
leonard Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.
sheldon Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?
leonard Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.
sheldon No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.
leonard All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
sheldon Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?
leonard Because I can never understand your side.
howard Give it back.
sheldon I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?
howard My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
sheldon Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?
howard Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.
sheldon I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , I’m using it.
howard Fine. I’m taking your diploma.
sheldon Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.
bernadette We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.
penny Yeah. So, how you doing?
amy A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?
penny Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.
amy I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.
bernadette Really? Only five?
penny Hey, anybody want a drink?
amy Sure.
bernadette Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?
amy For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.
bernadette Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
amy I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.
penny I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
bernadette I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.
amy I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.
bernadette What’s that supposed to mean?
amy Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.
bernadette You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.
amy If and when?
penny Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
bernadette Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.
amy That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
penny You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.
bernadette Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?
penny Damn.
amy Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
penny Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.
bernadette I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,
leonard Sheldon?
sheldon Cookie.
leonard I don’t have any.
sheldon Well, I’m not giving it away.
howard Hi Sheldon.
sheldon He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
leonard Howard, what are you doing?
howard He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
sheldon Get off there.
howard Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
sheldon Give me back my parking space.
howard You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.
sheldon You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.
howard Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.
raj I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.
leonard Mmm.
amy This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
sheldon Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
amy Freaking pigs.
sheldon Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.
amy Wait, I’m leaving my car here?
sheldon Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.
amy Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.
sheldon All right, colour me intrigued.
amy What do you think?
sheldon I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.
penny Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.
bernadette What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?
penny No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake. Oh, I’ll get it.
amy Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?
bernadette He’s not here. What’s wrong?
amy He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
bernadette Oh, no. Where was it parked?
amy In Sheldon’s spot.
bernadette That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?
amy Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.
bernadette Well, that doesn’t make sense, either.
amy Why not?
bernadette Because I’m the one who had it towed.
amy You?
bernadette Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?
amy Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming.
penny Ow! Ow!
amy Oh, my God,
bernadette Are you okay?!
penny You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!
amy Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve been meaning to take to the bank.
bernadette Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.
amy Are you okay?
penny Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
bernadette Here.
penny Thanks. Ah!
bernadette Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?
penny Gee, you think?
amy I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.
bernadette You hit her! What did I do?
amy You had my car towed.
bernadette You were parked in Howard’s spot.
amy I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.
bernadette Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.
penny Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.
bernadette Okay, let’s go.
amy I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
bernadette The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.
amy How do you know?
bernadette ‘Cause I did it!
sheldon Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.
howard What the hell are you doing?
sheldon Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.
howard Okay, you need to move now.
sheldon No, I don’t.
howard You can’t stay there forever.
sheldon Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to…
howard Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,
sheldon Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?
howard I’m warning you, Sheldon!
sheldon Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. Stop that.
howard Get out of my spot.
sheldon No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
leonard What are you idiots doing?
sheldon He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.
howard Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
leonard You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.
howard It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.
sheldon Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.
howard Can you believe this guy?
leonard What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
howard Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate me just because I lived the dream.
sheldon Hey, sweet ride.
howard What are you doing in there?
sheldon Just breaking in your new car.
howard Stop that. You stop that.
sheldon You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
raj Hey, got a minute?
sheldon Oh, of course, come in. This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.
raj Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
howard All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…
raj Howard, that’s not how we practiced it.
howard I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure across the street.
sheldon Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.
howard Thank you.
sheldon Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.
howard Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say.
sheldon There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.
raj Just say it.
howard You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.
howard I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.
sheldon To burying the hatchet.
bernadette You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.
amy Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.
penny Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.
shopkeeper Can I help you?
sheldon Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.
shopkeeper A what?
sheldon A naked man sat on it. Now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
shopkeeper Lipid what?
sheldon Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.
shopkeeper Tuesday okay?
sheldon Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
shopkeeper Let me write you a ticket.
sheldon Is that your son?
shopkeeper Uh-huh.
sheldon Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis.
