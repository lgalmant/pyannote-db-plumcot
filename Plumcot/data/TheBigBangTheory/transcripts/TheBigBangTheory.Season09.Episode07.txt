leonard_hofstadter Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
raj_koothrappali Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.
penny In school?
raj_koothrappali Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.
penny Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
leonard_hofstadter You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
sheldon_cooper Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
leonard_hofstadter Why is he writing to you?
sheldon_cooper Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Hey, high five.
sheldon_cooper Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?
penny Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
sheldon_cooper This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. You got a minute?
howard_wolowitz Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Pause the game, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?
bernadette_rostenkowski We need to talk about redecorating this place.
howard_wolowitz Oh, no, not this again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.
howard_wolowitz Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?
bernadette_rostenkowski All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.
howard_wolowitz May I say something?
bernadette_rostenkowski Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
howard_wolowitz Never mind.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life.
leonard_hofstadter I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.
penny And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.
adam_nimoy Nice to meet you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.
wil_wheaton I told you. This guy is gold.
bernadette_rostenkowski Whatcha doing?
howard_wolowitz Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.
howard_wolowitz I’m listening.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.
howard_wolowitz That is reasonable. But what room?
bernadette_rostenkowski How ’bout this one?
howard_wolowitz No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.
bernadette_rostenkowski Then how ’bout the bathroom?
howard_wolowitz I want to change my answer.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. Then the dining room.
howard_wolowitz I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
bernadette_rostenkowski Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.
adam_nimoy All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera’s not here.
sheldon_cooper All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
leonard_hofstadter How long have you known Adam?
wil_wheaton A few years.
leonard_hofstadter And what are you getting him back for?
adam_nimoy Let’s start with your name and occupation.
sheldon_cooper Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.
adam_nimoy And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?
adam_nimoy What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
sheldon_cooper I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.
penny Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.
leonard_hofstadter My brother was mean to me, too.
penny Yeah, you probably had it coming.
adam_nimoy Do you have any Spock collectibles?
sheldon_cooper I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.
penny Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.
adam_nimoy Can we see the napkin?
sheldon_cooper Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
leonard_hofstadter When did we get a wall safe?
sheldon_cooper When there was no more room in the floor safe.
leonard_hofstadter When did we get a floor safe?
sheldon_cooper When we got the security camera.
leonard_hofstadter There’s a security camera?
sheldon_cooper Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.
penny Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.
raj_koothrappali So, your father-in-law is in there right now?
howard_wolowitz Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. Got it.
howard_wolowitz Hey. What’s going on?
raj_koothrappali Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.
raj_koothrappali You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.
mike_rostenkowski What’s so great about it?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry. I did what I could.
bernadette_rostenkowski Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
howard_wolowitz Your dad’s on your side.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.
raj_koothrappali That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.
howard_wolowitz Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.
raj_koothrappali Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
howard_wolowitz When is your visa up?
sheldon_cooper Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.
wil_wheaton Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?
sheldon_cooper No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.
penny Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?
sheldon_cooper Wouldn’t you like to know?
penny I would.
sheldon_cooper All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.
leonard_hofstadter You have a will?
sheldon_cooper Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.
leonard_hofstadter Will Wil want it?
wil_wheaton Wil won’t.
penny Oh, what’s that ring box?
sheldon_cooper Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter You bought her a ring?
sheldon_cooper No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.
wil_wheaton Sheldon, that’s awful.
sheldon_cooper No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.
penny Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?
sheldon_cooper No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.
sheldon_cooper No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.
penny I know. It just…
sheldon_cooper I said I’m fine! We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?
adam_nimoy Did you find that helpful?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.
penny I knew I could smell ’em.
adam_nimoy What about from when you were a kid?
sheldon_cooper Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
adam_nimoy Did it work?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.
adam_nimoy That must have been very upsetting for you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.
penny Oh pfft.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me?
penny I’m sorry. I’m not here.
sheldon_cooper No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
penny Um.
leonard_hofstadter You did go pfft.
penny All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.
leonard_hofstadter Just like you.
penny I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.
sheldon_cooper Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.
penny Sweetie, you’re yelling.
sheldon_cooper Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.
wil_wheaton This documentary is gonna be awesome.
mike_rostenkowski You gonna be okay down here?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.
mike_rostenkowski Yeah, that’s a rat skull.
howard_wolowitz Oh.
mike_rostenkowski Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more.
howard_wolowitz Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?
mike_rostenkowski Yeah. I think that’s the den.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.
mike_rostenkowski Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.
howard_wolowitz Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?
mike_rostenkowski ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.
howard_wolowitz That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.
mike_rostenkowski Huh.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…
bernadette_rostenkowski Earthquake.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aftershock.
penny I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.
leonard_hofstadter I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy. How you doing?
sheldon_cooper Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah.
penny Definitely.
sheldon_cooper Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.
penny Do you know what that means?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny Are you telling the truth?
leonard_hofstadter Nirsh.
sheldon_cooper Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.
penny What are you gonna do?
sheldon_cooper I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.
leonard_hofstadter He didn’t meant that.
bernadette_rostenkowski So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
howard_wolowitz That would be nice.
bernadette_rostenkowski I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.
howard_wolowitz But you were okay throwing me under the bus?
bernadette_rostenkowski Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.
mike_rostenkowski Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?
mike_rostenkowski This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.
raj_koothrappali It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.
howard_wolowitz Why are you still here?
raj_koothrappali Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.
howard_wolowitz All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why?
howard_wolowitz Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I’ll think about it.
howard_wolowitz And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s an actual I’ll think about it.
howard_wolowitz I really believe I’d be a great dad.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know you would.
howard_wolowitz Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?
kirk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 Dr. Dana feels he isn’t that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
mr_spock Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is logic.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?
leonard_hofstadter Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.
sheldon_cooper Those are very wise words.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
