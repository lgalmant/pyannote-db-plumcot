penny Hey, you guys ready to order?
howard Uh..
leonard Sure
penny Okay, Priya?
priya Uh, I’ll have the Shepherd’s Pie. You want to split that with me?
leonard Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.
priya Why not?
leonard Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.
sheldon Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.
leonard So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?
leonard Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
howard You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.
leonard Kill me.
sheldon It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
bernadette Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news.
sheldon Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?
leonard So, what’s your news, Bernadette?
bernadette The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.
penny Oh!
sheldon Oh, congratulations.
penny Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.
howard Congratulations, honey.
bernadette Thank you.
leonard So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
sheldon Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.
howard Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you.
bernadette Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!
howard What?
leonard Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?
howard Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
leonard Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor.
penny Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.
raj Oh, if there was a problem, you can’t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. .
priya Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.
leonard You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.
priya Shh, my brother’s going to hear you.
leonard Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship.
raj Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
priya I can’t believe I’m wearing my brother’s Halloween costume.
leonard I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.
raj Okay, gotta go.
howard Hey, what’s up?
mrs_wolowitz Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?
howard No, Ma! It’s Raj!
mrs_wolowitz He’s a doctor too, right?
howard Yes!
mrs_wolowitz Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!
howard Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!
mrs_wolowitz Well, whose fault is that?
howard What’s up?
raj Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
howard Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother.
raj I guess that’s okay.
howard Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!
mrs_wolowitz Of course, he and I can play doctor!
raj She’s kidding, right?
howard I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.
mrs_wolowitz Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!
sheldon I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.
amy It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.
sheldon Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
amy I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?
sheldon It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
amy Have you considered massage?
sheldon I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
amy I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
sheldon Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
amy Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
sheldon All right.
amy Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
sheldon Rotating.
amy You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
sheldon You mean the myofascial point?
amy Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!
amy Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
sheldon There’s someone at my door.
amy That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.
raj Can I sleep here tonight?
sheldon Why?
raj Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
sheldon I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
raj Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.
sheldon No, I can’t authorize that.
raj Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?
sheldon The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.
raj Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.
sheldon All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.
raj Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.
raj You’re kidding.
sheldon I never kid about safety.
leonard What are you doing here?
raj I was sleeping.
leonard In my bed?
raj Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
leonard Oh, you heard?
raj Scotty, I need more power.
leonard Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
raj Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.
leonard Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?
raj Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?
leonard We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
raj Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
leonard Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.
raj Can I bring girls here?
leonard You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
raj Okay, deal.
leonard Just not against their will.
leonard Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
howard Why?
leonard If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.
raj He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.
howard Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.
leonard Until you have kids.
sheldon Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while.
raj When did you take my blood?
sheldon Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.
raj What the hell is this?
sheldon Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
raj This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
sheldon As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign.
raj Did you sign this?
leonard There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.
raj Well, that seems fair.
sheldon Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.
leonard Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
sheldon Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.
leonard No backsies.
raj Sheldon, dinner!
sheldon What is this?
raj This is the difference between eating and dining.
sheldon Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
raj It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
penny Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
sheldon Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
penny Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?
sheldon My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. Uh, nice touch, by the way.
penny What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
sheldon The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
raj I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
penny All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?
raj He’s living at my place, so I’m living here.
sheldon You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
penny Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.
sheldon No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline.
raj It’s a good thing.
howard So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
bernadette Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.
howard Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to.
bernadette I wanted to. Come on, open it.
howard You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
bernadette Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.
raj More wine?
penny Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already.
sheldon Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
penny Hit me.
sheldon Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
penny Monkeys.
sheldon When does a monkey have a trunk?
penny When a suitcase just won’t do.
sheldon Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.
penny Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?
raj Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
penny What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack.
raj Every night.
penny Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
raj It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
penny Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?
raj Yeah.
penny I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
raj Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.
penny Oh, you poor baby.
raj What’s wrong with me, Penny?
penny Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
raj Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
penny I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.
raj To friendship.
sheldon Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
leonard Mmm. Mmm.
priya Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup.
leonard Sorry.
priya That’s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.
leonard Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?
priya Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time.
leonard When is the time?
priya I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.
leonard Fine.
priya Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
dr_koothrappali We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?
priya No.
mrs_koothrappali Where is your brother?
priya Out with friends.
dr_koothrappali I don’t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.
mrs_koothrappali I’ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
leonard You’re moving back to India?
dr_koothrappali Who’s that?
mrs_koothrappali Oh, my God! There’s someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!
leonard When were you going to tell me about this?
priya Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh’s friend Leonard.
dr_koothrappali I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.
priya He has many friends.
dr_koothrappali Rajesh has many friends?
mrs_koothrappali Why are you lying to us?
leonard She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
priya Leonard!
leonard Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up.
priya You know what? I don’t want to deal with this right now.
leonard So. Hot in India?
dr_koothrappali Of course it is. It always is. It’s India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
leonard Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
penny Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? Really? Still can’t talk to me?
sheldon What are you doing here?
leonard What?
sheldon I said, what are you doing here?
leonard I live here.
sheldon I have paperwork that says differently.
leonard Priya’s going back to India.
sheldon Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it. What are you doing here?
howard I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
sheldon Why?
howard She gave me a beautiful watch.
sheldon Leonard, do you understand this?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Talk to him.
penny Damn.
leonard What’s going on?
penny Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like.
sheldon What does it look like?
