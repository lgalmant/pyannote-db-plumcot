penny Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?
leonard ‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
penny I got asked to sign autographs there.
leonard That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
penny Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.
leonard When is it?
penny It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.
leonard What? Why not?
penny You just said yourself, it’s sad.
leonard Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.
penny I don’t know.
leonard You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.
penny I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
leonard Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.
penny Oh, yeah.
amy You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.
sheldon We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.
amy You know what I meant.
sheldon All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop.
amy I’m sorry I mentioned it.
sheldon Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.
howard That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick.
bernadette What are you doing?
howard I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there.
bernadette Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it.
howard Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.
bernadette Which MIT did you go to?
howard Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!
bernadette Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.
howard Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
bernadette The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
howard Are we even in a good school…? Ow!
bernadette I warned you, and I did it.
penny What’s all this?
leonard Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.
penny Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.
leonard Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.
penny Who’s that?
leonard Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?
penny Oh, there’s so much I want to change.
leonard Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck.
amy What’s going on here?
sheldon You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.
amy Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?
sheldon Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
amy You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
sheldon Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.
amy That’s an odd mix of people.
sheldon Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
amy You never went into that haunted house.
sheldon You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
amy Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.
sheldon Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises.
amy Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have
sheldon Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
howard Hi.
bernadette Hey, where you been?
howard Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.
raj Wait till you see the crib we found.
bernadette You bought a crib without me?
howard You’re gonna love it.
raj Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.
bernadette Sounds expensive.
howard Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety.
raj Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.
howard But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it.
bernadette Fine.
howard In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?
bernadette You bought a minivan?
howard It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.
raj Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.
bernadette I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.
howard The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore.
raj Then again, he did think you were my husband.
bernadette They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?
leonard Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
penny Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
leonard Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour.
penny Alright, why not five and ten bucks?
leonard Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.
penny Hey, that guy’s looking over here.
leonard Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?
penny I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi.
guy Hi. I love your movie.
penny Well, thanks.
guy It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life.
penny Your love confuses me.
leonard Would you like an autograph?
guy Sure.
penny Okay. Who do I make it out to?
guy Daniel.
penny Okay.
daniel I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?
penny That did not clear things up.
leonard That’ll be four seventy-five.
daniel Keep the change.
leonard But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.
amy There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.
sheldon The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.
amy Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.
sheldon Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
bert I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.
amy How old was it
bert It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it.
sheldon Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?
mrs_petrescu Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s.
sheldon She’s learning English from TV.
mrs_petrescu TV, good. Now back to you.
stuart Hey, guys.
amy Hi, Stuart.
stuart These are for you.
amy Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you.
sheldon Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
stuart Nice to meet you.
mrs_petrescu Hello.
bert Hey.
stuart So, what did I miss?
bert Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.
mrs_petrescu 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
stuart Anybody else coming to this thing?
penny What’s your name?
jeff Jeff.
penny Okay.
jeff My favourite part is your shower scene.
penny Been hearing that a lot today.
jeff I even have a screen grab on my phone.
penny Yep, there they are.
leonard Okay, let’s keep it moving.
penny Here you go.
leonard Should’ve punched that guy.
penny Well, go ahead. He’s right over there.
leonard Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?
penny Hello.
awkward_guy Hi. I like your movies.
penny Thank you.
awkward_guy I saw both of them.
penny I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.
awkward_guy You think I could get a picture of us?
penny Oh, sure.
awkward_guy And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?
leonard No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
penny Leonard…
leonard No, no, no. It’s not okay.
awkward_guy Who are you?
leonard I’m her husband.
awkward_guy No, you’re not.
leonard I am.
penny Yeah, he really is.
awkward_guy No.
howard It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future.
raj Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.
howard Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?
bernadette I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?
howard You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
raj No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.
howard Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?
bernadette It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
howard Yes.
raj Yes.
howard See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.
bernadette Oh, is it your back?
howard Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.
sheldon So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.
bert I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.
amy Things didn’t work out?
bert I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks.
mrs_petrescu My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.
stuart Really, no one else is coming?
sheldon This is it. You are the practice round.
stuart Practice round? For-for what?
amy Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.
sheldon You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.
stuart So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?
sheldon Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.
amy Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people.
sheldon Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.
awkward_guy But how did you get her to go out with you?
leonard Well, she moved in across the hall.
penny And he started to slowly wear me down.
leonard Like a river carves a canyon.
penny Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.
redhaired_guy Ready to go?
awkward_guy Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.
redhaired_guy This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker.
penny I think it’s hot.
leonard That’s right. I’m her change daddy.
howard Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.
bernadette Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
howard You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.
bernadette Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.
howard You’re right. It sells itself.
raj You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride.
bernadette I was hoping it’d be quieter.
howard If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?
bernadette Soon.
howard Why is it taking so long?
howard I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.
raj I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
bernadette Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.
bert This is the best blintz I’ve ever had.
sheldon Oh. Thank you.
bert It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.
stuart You know what, I, I, I think I’m just gonna go.
amy No, Stuart, don’t.
stuart No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?
amy We’re so sorry.
stuart I’m always the last one anybody thinks of.
sheldon Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority.
stuart Bye.
sheldon Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.
bert I know how it feels, too.
sheldon All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.
stuart Thank you.
sheldon You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.
bert Hear, hear.
amy Cheers.
mrs_petrescu Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.
leonard And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
awkward_guy Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times.
leonard The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.
penny You know, once, I proposed to him.
leonard Yeah. I said no.
redhaired_guy Why?
leonard I just wanted to make her work for it.
penny Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later.
redhaired_guy Hang on. Is she just with you because you’re rich?
leonard She makes more money than I do.
awkward_guy What? Who are you?
sheldon Do you know what else I love about you?
stuart Hmm?
sheldon Your handwriting is impeccable.
stuart Thank you for noticing.
sheldon No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker.
stuart You know what I love about you?
sheldon Hmm?
stuart You never leave the house without a paper clip.
sheldon You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
stuart I also love how you never use swear words.
sheldon You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em.
amy Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
sheldon Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
