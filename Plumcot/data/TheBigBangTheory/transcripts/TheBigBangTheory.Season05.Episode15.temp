leonard Aaargh. What the hell?
sheldon Emergency preparedness drill.
leonard Oh, no, come on!
sheldon Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.
leonard I have to get a lock for my door.
sheldon I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.
leonard Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
sheldon Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?
leonard Fine.
sheldon All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.
leonard Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
sheldon You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?
leonard I don’t know, what am I doing?
sheldon Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!
leonard Aah!
sheldon And that’s why we wear hard hats.
howard Check it out, press release from NASA.
raj Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
howard This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
raj Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.
howard I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
raj Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.
howard Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
raj Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
leonard Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
howard Emergency drill night last night, huh?
leonard Uh-huh.
raj How’d you do?
leonard You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
sheldon You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
leonard Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?
sheldon Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.
raj They put you under for a cleaning?
sheldon Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter.
leonard Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist.
sheldon Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”
leonard You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
sheldon Well, it has. Ask anybody.
leonard I don’t care. I’m done.
sheldon Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
leonard I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.
sheldon Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. ‘Sup?
leonard Where do I sign?
sheldon Right here. Use your finger.
leonard There. Done.
sheldon All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
leonard I’m gonna go home and take a nap.
sheldon Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.
howard I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
penny What does that mean?
bernadette He’s gonna learn to poop in space.
howard Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
raj Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
sheldon Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard ‘Sup?
sheldon ‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.
amy I saved you a dumpling.
sheldon Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.
amy I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s.
sheldon You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?
penny Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?
bernadette Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
howard Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid.
sheldon Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?
raj Their meatballs are pretty good.
sheldon What’s that?
raj Nothing, nothing.
sheldon Hello, Stuart.
stuart Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?
sheldon No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.
stuart Ninth?
sheldon You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
stuart Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
sheldon Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?
stuart Yeah.
sheldon And your father? Alive?
stuart Yes.
sheldon How about your grandparents, they alive?
stuart No.
sheldon Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?
stuart I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?
sheldon Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.
stuart Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you to the dentist.
sheldon Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.
raj Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?
howard You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
raj Buzz Lightyear is not real.
howard No, that’s not what I’m talking about.
raj Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?
howard No.
raj Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.
howard Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.
raj All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?
leonard That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.
howard Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.
raj Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
howard Like how?
leonard Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.
howard Did it work?
leonard No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.
raj Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed.
howard That’s actually not a terrible plan.
raj They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
leonard ‘Sup?
sheldon ‘Sup?
leonard Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
sheldon Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.
leonard All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.
sheldon Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
leonard Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
raj Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.
sheldon I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.
penny Oh, good, your power’s out, too.
leonard Why is that good?
penny Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.
sheldon Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
leonard What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
sheldon Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you.
leonard It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon.
sheldon And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
penny You know, I got some candles in my apartment.
sheldon But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.
leonard You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go.
sheldon Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.
penny I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
sheldon Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind.
leonard To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
penny You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?
leonard I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.
penny Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
leonard I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
penny Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now.
sheldon Excuse me, Leonard.
leonard Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.
sheldon Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
leonard Fine, what is it?
sheldon I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
leonard S’mores, huh? Good for you.
sheldon Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.
leonard No, thanks. I’m good.
sheldon Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.
penny Aw.
leonard No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.
penny But he’s sad.
leonard No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in.
penny I think he misses his little buddy.
leonard Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.
leonard I thought you said candles were dangerous.
sheldon This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat. Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
leonard Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
sheldon What are you proposing?
leonard That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
sheldon And how would I do that?
leonard You say thank you.
sheldon Every time?
leonard It’s not crazy.
sheldon Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.
leonard I kind of like the sound of that.
sheldon Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else. Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
leonard So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?
sheldon No.
leonard Can I sit in your spot?
sheldon No.
leonard Can I control the thermostat?
sheldon No.
leonard Do I get a card?
sheldon Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.
penny Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.
leonard Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?
sheldon Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day.
penny Leonard’s Day?
sheldon Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good.
howard All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.
raj Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?
howard Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!
mrs_wolowitz Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.
howard Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.
nasa_guy Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.
howard No problem, Dr. Massimino.
dr_massimino The guys here call me Mass.
howard Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
mass Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…
howard Sorry. My phone.
mass What is that? Is that Rocket Man?
howard Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!
howard Not now!
mass Who’s that?
howard My mom. Sorry.
howard No problem, Fruit Loops.
