leonard_hofstadter Hey, will you steam my uniform next?
sheldon_cooper Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.
penny Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
penny Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.
penny I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
leonard_hofstadter That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
penny Is that better?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
sheldon_cooper So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.
penny Well, then why are you going?
sheldon_cooper It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good.
penny All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hang on a second. Hold this.
penny What was that for?
leonard_hofstadter To show people when they don’t believe me.
penny Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s not exhausting at all.
penny Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa, but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
amy_farrah_fowler When did Howard learn to sew?
bernadette_rostenkowski When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.
penny I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.
penny Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve never even read a comic book. You guys?
penny Uh-uh.
amy_farrah_fowler No.
bernadette_rostenkowski I mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.
amy_farrah_fowler Seriously?
bernadette_rostenkowski The comic book store isn’t far from here.
penny That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?
sheldon_cooper I think you should turn on the GPS.
leonard_hofstadter It is on.
sheldon_cooper But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
howard_wolowitz Has it really only been ten miles?
leonard_hofstadter I’m turning it on, but just to shut you up.
gps#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.
leonard_hofstadter What did you do?
sheldon_cooper I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
raj_koothrappali That is so cool.
leonard_hofstadter Counterpoint, no, it’s not.
gps#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here’s an interesting fact about interstates.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
sheldon_cooper Shh, he said it’s interesting.
gps#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.
howard_wolowitz Look, Leonard, there’s a bridge. Drive off it.
raj_koothrappali You know, we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
sheldon_cooper Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.
howard_wolowitz We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
raj_koothrappali Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that sounds fun.
sheldon_cooper Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
gps#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Recalculating. While we’re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
sheldon_cooper None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why are they staring?
amy_farrah_fowler Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.
stuart_bloom Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They’re just girls. It’s nothing you haven’t seen in movies or in drawings.
penny Hey, Stuart.
stuart_bloom What brings you guys here?
bernadette_rostenkowski We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
stuart_bloom Oh, well, I recommend you don’t open a store and sell them.
penny No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try.
stuart_bloom Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.
bernadette_rostenkowski What kind of comics do the guys like?
stuart_bloom Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, well, who’s the best superhero?
stuart_bloom Shh! You can’t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?
penny Well then, what do you recommend?
stuart_bloom Well, uh, let’s see. You’ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, I do love a bad boy.
penny As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
stuart_bloom If I were you, I’d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it’s intelligently written, and it doesn’t objectify or stereotype women.
penny Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.
stuart_bloom Yeah, he kind of is.
raj_koothrappali And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done.
sheldon_cooper I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes.
howard_wolowitz Come on, guys. Let’s do this.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m sweating my bald cap off.
howard_wolowitz So what’s our first pose going to be?
raj_koothrappali I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll set the timer.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
sheldon_cooper Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.
raj_koothrappali Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.
howard_wolowitz Okay, what’s next?
raj_koothrappali Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That’s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God. Leonard, someone’s stealing your car!
leonard_hofstadter What? Hey, hey! Come back here!
raj_koothrappali Stop!
sheldon_cooper Stealing is against the law!
leonard_hofstadter I don’t believe this.
howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch.
raj_koothrappali I’ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.
howard_wolowitz Oh, so is mine.
leonard_hofstadter Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?
sheldon_cooper Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. Nice going.
leonard_hofstadter What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
sheldon_cooper What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
leonard_hofstadter I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. Nice going.
howard_wolowitz Car.
raj_koothrappali What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?
sheldon_cooper Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
leonard_hofstadter Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.
sheldon_cooper Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.
howard_wolowitz Good idea. Why don’t you get started on that?
leonard_hofstadter Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.
sheldon_cooper What, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper All right.
penny Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!
penny Yeah, well, I have street smarts.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, what’d you guys think?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, there was a lot of action.
penny Mmm.
amy_farrah_fowler And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what’s the word I’m looking for?
penny Stupid?
amy_farrah_fowler So stupid.
penny I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist.
amy_farrah_fowler What a waste of time.
penny I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think it’s heavy. It’s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.
penny That makes even less sense, I mean…
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.
penny Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
penny Well, which is it?
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe we missed something.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s read it again.
penny Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski You want some tea?
amy_farrah_fowler Good idea. I’ll help you.
penny Wait, I thought we were reading.
amy_farrah_fowler We are. We’re just, uh, giving you a head start.
howard_wolowitz I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.
raj_koothrappali Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.
raj_koothrappali Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.
leonard_hofstadter Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…
guy Nerds!
sheldon_cooper I hate this planet.
amy_farrah_fowler It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide?
penny Yes!
amy_farrah_fowler No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.
penny You said it’s a magic hammer.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions.
penny If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s hammer?
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can’t even take you seriously.
sheldon_cooper Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?
leonard_hofstadter Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Why don’t you ask Scotty to beam you up?
sheldon_cooper Scotty was on the original series, and we’re Next Generation. So, joke’s on you.
howard_wolowitz We’re not with him.
amy_farrah_fowler You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.
penny Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?
amy_farrah_fowler Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
bernadette_rostenkowski Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don’t we go look at those?
penny Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.
officer_reynolds Was there anything valuable in the car?
leonard_hofstadter Our clothes, our wallets, phones.
raj_koothrappali And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.
officer_reynolds Makeup? Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds.
officer_reynolds I don’t know, sounds pretty cool.
raj_koothrappali It, it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, he gets how cool it is.
officer_reynolds I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I’m guessing your moms?
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, but we’ve got it covered.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.
raj_koothrappali Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through, I just want to go home.
raj_koothrappali Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.
howard_wolowitz I’m with Leonard. I’m done.
raj_koothrappali Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?
sheldon_cooper Actually, it’s three against one.
raj_koothrappali What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah?
bernadette_rostenkowski Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.
amy_farrah_fowler No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.
penny Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?
amy_farrah_fowler Did that ever happen?
penny Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?
sheldon_cooper Well, I say that’s the last time we ever go outside.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor’s hammer ’cause Thor’s touching it.
penny No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching the strap.
amy_farrah_fowler The strap is part of the hammer.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not!
raj_koothrappali Are they actually arguing about comic books?
leonard_hofstadter No, that can’t be right.
howard_wolowitz Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
bernadette_rostenkowski Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
penny How could Red Hulk be worthy?
bernadette_rostenkowski You don’t know his life.
sheldon_cooper There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
raj_koothrappali If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.
sheldon_cooper Captain, what are your orders?
leonard_hofstadter I say we investigate.
sheldon_cooper Wait. They might be hostile.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
gps#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.
car_thief_1 Wow, that is interesting.
car_thief_2 You learn something new every day.
gps#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?
car_thief_1 Ooh, another quiz.
car_thief_2 Yes!
