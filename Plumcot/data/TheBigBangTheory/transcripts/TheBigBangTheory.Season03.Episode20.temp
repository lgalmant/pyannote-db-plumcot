penny Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
sheldon Uh-oh.
penny What?
sheldon I was going to get my mail.
penny Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
sheldon I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
penny God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
sheldon Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
penny Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
sheldon Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.
penny Really?
sheldon Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.
penny Right.
sheldon Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
penny Everyone.
sheldon Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.
penny Great.
sheldon Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.
penny So, how you been?
sheldon Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
penny You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?
sheldon Bazinga.
penny Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?
sheldon He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
penny I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.
sheldon I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
penny Yep.
sheldon That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.
penny Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
sheldon I’m hungry now.
penny Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?
sheldon Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
penny I don’t have hot dogs.
sheldon Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. .
leonard Hey, where you been?
sheldon I was talking with Penny.
howard What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.
leonard No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.
raj Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
sheldon Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
howard So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.
sheldon Which one picks last?
howard What?
sheldon Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.
leonard Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.
sheldon Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!
leonard Okay.
sheldon Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
leonard I don’t know. Why?
sheldon Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!
howard Oh, God, this is good.
raj Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
howard Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.
leonard Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
sheldon Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
leonard So, you guys want to do something tonight?
howard Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.
leonard What about you, Raj?
raj Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.
leonard I never stopped hanging out with you.
raj Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman.
howard I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
sheldon Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
leonard You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
raj What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?
sheldon Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.
leonard Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
howard Yeah, since when do you take walks?
sheldon I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.
howard Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.
sheldon Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.
howard Or we could go together.
sheldon I can’t think of a reason why not.
howard Let’s go.
sheldon Hold on. Nope, no reason.
raj I’ve missed you.
sheldon All right, say hello to your mother for me.
howard Okay.
sheldon What?
howard You said you were going for a walk.
sheldon I didn’t say outside.
howard So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?
sheldon No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
womans_voice Here Bubbles. Here boy.
howard Which way are you going?
sheldon Which way are you going?
howard I parked my scooter down the block.
sheldon I’m going the other way. Bye.
howard Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
sheldon No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
howard I definitely smell raw hot dog.
sheldon Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
howard All right, have a nice walk.
sheldon I shall. Have a nice scoot.
howard You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.
sheldon Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
sheldon Penny, Penny. Penny. Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
raj Hey, Leonard?
leonard Yeah?
raj I haven’t had sex in a year.
leonard Where you going with this, Raj?
raj Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
leonard So, go.
raj Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.
leonard And you think my presence will help with that?
raj Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.
leonard I’m not going out tonight, Raj.
raj All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
leonard Very much.
raj Doesn’t have to be Asian.
leonard Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
raj No, I won’t.
leonard Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
raj You really think so?
leonard I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
raj But we’ll have sex first, right?
sheldon Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.
penny So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
sheldon Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
penny Well, good.
sheldon I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
penny He’s been crying?
sheldon Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.
penny Oh, God, I feel terrible.
sheldon Do you have a stomach ache, too?
penny No. Why, do you?
sheldon No.
penny Why did you ask if I had one, too?
sheldon Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
penny All right. So, what’s new in your life?
sheldon Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
penny Have you been running?
sheldon No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
penny I’m so glad you like it.
sheldon I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
penny Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.
sheldon You can’t cook and you made me this.
penny Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
sheldon Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.
raj Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
leonard I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
raj You don’t know that. Prison changes people.
leonard Hey, where you been?
sheldon I told you, walking.
leonard For an hour and a half?
sheldon I got lost.
leonard How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
sheldon Satellites are down. Solar flares.
raj There are no solar flares right now.
sheldon Yes, there are.
raj Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.
sheldon I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
leonard What the hell was that about?
raj I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
leonard Oh, we really need to get you a girl.
sheldon Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
leonard Oh, just come in!
sheldon Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
leonard What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon Maybe this isn’t a good time.
leonard Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
sheldon Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
leonard What do you want?
sheldon You may want to sit down.
leonard I’m in bed!
sheldon Point taken. You may want to sit up.
leonard Sheldon!
sheldon I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
leonard Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?
sheldon We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
leonard Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
sheldon I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
leonard Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
sheldon I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
leonard Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
sheldon Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
leonard Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.
sheldon Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
leonard I guess not.
sheldon And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
penny Oh, um, I, I can come back.
leonard D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.
penny Yeah, I guess you’re right.
leonard You used to it yet?
penny Nope.
leonard Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.
penny Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.
leonard His mother?
penny Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
leonard I was going to do that.
penny Oh, well, then you, you do it.
leonard No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.
penny Okay, you can take him for shoes.
leonard I just took him for shoes.
penny Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
leonard Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
penny Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
leonard You’re taking him to Disneyland?
penny Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
leonard All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
penny We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.
leonard All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
penny Okay, whatever.
leonard And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
penny All right, got it. Is there anything else?
leonard Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.
penny What’s the problem with Goofy?
leonard Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
raj Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
howard Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about.
penny We’re home.
leonard It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?
sheldon We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
leonard I was going to see that with him.
penny How was I supposed to know that?
sheldon It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
leonard And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
penny I know, I know.
sheldon I can still eat.
penny No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
sheldon Okay, but just don’t fight
leonard We’re not fighting.
penny Just go.
leonard Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
sheldon Thank you, Penny.
penny You’re welcome, sweetie.
leonard Want a cup of coffee?
penny Oh, um, I should probably get going.
leonard Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
penny Yep, okay.
howard Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.
leonard What am I smelling?
penny Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
penny He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.
leonard Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
penny I think we can do it.
leonard Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
penny No, be friends. You and me.
leonard Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
penny Good. I’m glad.
leonard Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.
penny Good night, Leonard.
leonard Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
sheldon No, Goofy, no.
