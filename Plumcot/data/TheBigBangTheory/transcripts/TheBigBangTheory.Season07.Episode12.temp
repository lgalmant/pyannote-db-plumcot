amy This is nice, that we all get to eat together.
leonard Absolutely.
amy Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
sheldon We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to.
penny Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.
leonard What happened?
penny I just got a part on a TV show.
amy Congratulations.
leonard What? That’s great. Guys.
howard Oh, yeah
sheldon Yay, Penny.
amy What’s the show?
penny Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!
leonard That’s amazing.
penny Yeah.
howard What’s your part?
penny Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.
raj Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.
leonard So it, it’s just flirting?
penny Well, yeah. Why?
leonard Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.
amy He’s wrong.
raj So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
leonard Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
raj I don’t see why not.
howard If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.
sheldon Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.
leonard It’s a joke.
sheldon I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.
penny Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.
howard We’ll be there.
raj Can we bring anything?
penny Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.
sheldon Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.
sheldon Leonard, do you think I’m funny?
leonard No. Do you?
sheldon I think I’m hysterical.
leonard I take it back. That was funny.
sheldon The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object.
leonard I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
sheldon Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.
leonard You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.
sheldon Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.
leonard Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…
sheldon I don’t get it.
bernadette Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.
howard Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
raj I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?
bernadette Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.
stuart When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.
raj Are possums cute?
stuart Not at all.
howard If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.
raj You mean like fatties and uggos?
bernadette Or maybe just stop talking.
howard I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary.
bernadette Or just keep dating the possum.
voice_on_television Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.
second_voice No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…
leonard I’m so proud of you.
penny We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
leonard I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.
sheldon I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.
amy Why?
sheldon I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.
amy Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
sheldon All right.
penny Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.
man_on_tv I guess it’s you and me, kid.
mark_harmon_on_tv What are you doing?
woman_on_tv I’m trying to make peace.
mark_harmon_on_tv We’re good.
woman_on_tv Good.
mark_harmon_on_tv Really? Because…
penny Are you kidding me?
leonard What’s wrong?
penny Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?
sheldon Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost.
penny No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.
bernadette What happened?
penny They must’ve cut it.
leonard Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry.
howard That stinks.
raj I’m sure you were great.
penny This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.
sheldon I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.
penny No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.
leonard How you doing?
penny Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
leonard You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.
penny Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.
leonard Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.
penny Unbelievable.
leonard Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.
penny Then what did you mean?
leonard I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.
penny I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
leonard Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.
penny I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.
leonard Right.
penny Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
leonard Yes.
penny So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
leonard Honestly?
penny Yes, honestly.
leonard I don’t.
penny How could you say that?
leonard I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.
penny Oh.
leonard Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.
penny No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.
leonard That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.
penny Wow, thank you.
leonard Should’ve let Sheldon come.
sheldon This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.
amy Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…
sheldon BRAIN LESIONS!
amy Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny.
sheldon Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
amy Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological… Okay, that’s pretty good.
sheldon Excellent.
stuart How about her?
raj No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
stuart Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
raj That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?
stuart We’ll find somebody else.
sheldon Kumquat?
amy I guess.
sheldon Ointment?
amy Sure.
sheldon Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?
amy I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.
sheldon Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.
amy Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?
sheldon All of them.
penny You didn’t get your part cut.
voice_on_tv All right, baby, here’s the deal.
penny And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!
leonard Hey. Can we talk?
penny We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.
leonard That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.
penny Thank you.
leonard And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.
penny Are you serious? For what?
leonard The new Star Wars movie.
penny What? How did you manage that?
leonard There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.
penny Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.
leonard So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.
penny Really, let it go.
leonard Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.
stuart How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?
raj Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.
stuart We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.
raj I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.
amy Hello.
bernadette Hey.
howard Where’s Sheldon?
amy He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
bernadette That’s interesting.
amy It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?
bernadette If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.
howard Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
bernadette No, of course not.
howard Well, I’d be able to tell anyway.
bernadette I don’t think you would.
howard Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.
leonard Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?
penny Hey.
leonard Yeah, I’ll call you back.
penny Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.
leonard Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.
penny Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.
leonard Come on. It’s okay.
penny No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.
leonard No, you’re not.
penny Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.
leonard Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.
penny No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.
leonard Well, you have me.
penny You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
leonard What?
penny Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?
leonard Um…
penny Did you seriously just say um?
leonard Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.
penny Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?
leonard That is not what I said.
penny No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.
sheldon Who’s in the mood to laugh?
leonard Really not a good time.
sheldon But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
penny I’m gonna go.
leonard Penny, don’t.
penny No, no, I just need to be alone.
sheldon So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?
leonard To my room.
sheldon Should I follow you?
leonard No.
sheldon Leonard, wait.
leonard What?
sheldon I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
stuart How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.
raj That’s a mirror.
stuart Oh, yeah.
security_guard Hey, fellas, mall’s closing.
raj Sorry.
security_guard Yeah. Good night.
raj Uh, excuse me.
security_guard Yeah?
raj Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?
security_guard It’s all right.
raj Okay, nice talking to you.
stuart Smooth.
sheldon Can’t sleep?
leonard No.
sheldon Would you like to talk about it?
leonard Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes.
sheldon Why not?
leonard That’s a good question.
sheldon Does that mean the relationship is over?
leonard I don’t know.
sheldon Why don’t you ask her?
leonard Because I’m afraid to know the answer.
sheldon Well, I’m sorry.
leonard That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
sheldon No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry.
leonard Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
sheldon No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.
howard Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…
bernadette How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
howard I’m in the middle of something.
bernadette So am I.
