bernadette So, what are you working on these days?
amy I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
bernadette What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
penny Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.
bermadette Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.
penny Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.
bernadette He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?
amy I think it’s awful.
penny Why would you say that?
amy Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?
penny I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
bernadette Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
amy I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
penny Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.
amy Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.
bernadette I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad.
penny No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.
man_with_flowers Thank you.
sheldon No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know.
man I’m not a delivery man, I’m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.
sheldon That’s humorous.
man All right.
sheldon Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.
man All right.
sheldon Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.
man All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.
sheldon Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.
man I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.
sheldon Making the extra effort. Good for you.
leonard Great timing, food just got here.
sheldon Ooh, Siam Palace?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Uh, extra peanut sauce?
leonard No, but you can have mine.
sheldon Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.
leonard What? Why didn’t you say that first?
sheldon Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
leonard Can I help you?
man Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?
leonard May I ask why?
man Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.
leonard Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you.
man Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two…
leonard I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.
man Really? I’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.
raj Really?
man So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?
leonard I think so.
man When will I learn? It’s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.
leonard Excuse me?
man Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You’re a, you’re a lucky man.
leonard Thank you. Sorry.
man Oh, uh, you probably don’t want her to see this. It’s unnecessarily graphic.
sheldon Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.
leonard He tried to score with Penny.
sheldon So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.
amy So, how was work today?
bernadette It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.
amy What happened?
bernadette I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.
amy Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.
bernadette I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here.
amy Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.
bernadette What? How?
amy I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
bernadette Amy, what did you say?
amy I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.
bernadette Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.
amy Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.
bernadette No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.
amy But it was bad publicity.
bernadette That’s for me to decide, not you.
amy I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.
bernadette And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line.
amy You have a nice night.
bernadette Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.
sheldon Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.
man Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.
raj Oh, cool.
howard How’d you get that?
man Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.
sehldon Wait a minute. You’ve snipped Gene Roddenberry’s vas deferens?
man Yes.
howard Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.
man I don’t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I’m kind of the doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts.
all Wow.
man Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron’s kidney stone?
all Ooh.
man He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.
leonard That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
man Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn’t really get serious until William Shatner’s bladder infection.
sheldon What’d you get? What’d you get?
man Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it’s pretty cool.
raj I would love to see your collection.
man Anytime. Uh, I’ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.
howard We know.
raj Preach.
man Can I ask you a personal question?
leonard Sure.
man Um, I mean, you’re a guy like me, so how’d you get a girl like Penny?
leonard Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.
sheldon Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.
leonard I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.
howard A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
leonard Can we please change the subject?
penny Hi.
raj Well, that didn’t go your way.
penny Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?
dr_lorvis Uh, well, actually I came to see you.
penny Really? Why?
leonard Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.
sheldon Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.
penny Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.
dr_lorvis You touched my arm for two Mississippis.
penny Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.
leonard Can we talk in private?
penny Please, yes.
leonard I’ll be right back.
sheldon So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
leonard So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?
penny What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.
leonard Why?
penny Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?
leonard Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.
penny You were okay with that?
leonard No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.
penny Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?
leonard A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy.
penny Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.
leonard Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
penny I can’t do it, he’s my best client.
leonard All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.
raj Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?
leonard Yeah, sure. You owe me.
leonard Oh, my God.
sheldon Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.
dr_lorvis Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.
howard Oh, come on. It’s a replica.
dr_lorvis Original.
howard Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.
raj The gun from Hellboy?
dr_lorvis Yup.
raj How did you get it?
dr_lorvis Bought it at auction.
raj Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.
womans_voice Oliver, I’m going to play bingo.
dr_lorvis Okay, Mother. Have fun.
howard Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?
raj Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond.
leonard Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
sheldon Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?
leonard No, because I liked it.
sheldon Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.
dr_lorvis So, I’ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.
sheldon Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.
dr_lorvis So, you think she’ll be single soon?
sheldon Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased.
dr_lorvis Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.
sheldon Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.
leonard What?
sheldon I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
dr_lorvis Oh, could you hold the door?
amy Nice flowers.
dr_lorvis Thank you. They’re for a girl. Uh, I’m being implacable and relentless.
amy Isn’t she lucky?
dr_lorvis She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.
amy What’s that?
dr_lorvis Unconditional love.
amy I guess that’s all anybody wants.
dr_lorvis I guess so.
amy Well, I hope you get it.
dr_lorvis One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
leonard Next game, let’s switch helmets.
sheldon No, I’d look silly in that helmet.
amy I can’t take these.
dr_lorvis Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.
amy But what about the other girl?
dr_lorvis Oh, right. I’ll tell her we should just be friends.
penny Dr. Lorvis?
dr_lorvis Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?
raj You think he bites?
howard Stick your head in there and find out.
raj You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
leonard I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.
raj Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
howard It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.
raj Okay, now you’re messing with me.
leonard Uh, guys, we’re locked in here.
sheldon Oh, this day just keeps getting better.
penny So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?
dr_lorvis Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.
amy We all have a past.
penny Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy.
dr_lorvis You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.
penny Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you.
dr_lorvis Well, that’s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.
penny Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?
dr_lorvis Well, they’re, they’re not locked in. The door just sticks.
penny Okay, so how do they unstick it?
dr_lorvis They’d need the key.
penny Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.
dr_lorvis Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.
penny Move it.
bernadette Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry.
amy That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
bernadette What?
dr_lorvis She seems nice. Who’s she?
penny Just walk.
sheldon You can do this.
raj One ladder left.
leonard Oh-hom yeah.
howard Yes.
leonard Next level.
penny Leonard, are you okay?
leonard Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
amy Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?
dr_lorvis Yes. I’m very sorry for locking you in my home.
howard Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.
leonard Got it.
penny Okay, Leonard, let’s go.
leonard Just hang on.
dr_lorvis Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire’s prostate sonogram?
amy Sure.
penny Yeah.
dr_lorvis Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.
