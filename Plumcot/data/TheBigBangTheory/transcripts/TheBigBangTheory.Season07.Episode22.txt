sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.
penny What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?
howard_wolowitz No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day.
penny So, when is it?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.
sheldon_cooper Get it?
raj_koothrappali May the fourth be with you?
leonard_hofstadter May the force be with you. Get it?
penny Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.
sheldon_cooper Come in.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you got a second?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news.
sheldon_cooper What is it?
leonard_hofstadter I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
sheldon_cooper Professor Proton is dead?
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, buddy.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Comforting you?
sheldon_cooper Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday.
sheldon_cooper But, that’s Star Wars Day.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.
sheldon_cooper I’m fine.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
arthur_jeffries This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can’t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn’t that a hoot? We’ll be right back after I fire my writers. Oh, shut up.
amy_farrah_fowler Watching your old friend?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.
amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
sheldon_cooper All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?
sheldon_cooper Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.
amy_farrah_fowler And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?
sheldon_cooper If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.
penny Hey, guys.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.
penny Okay.
raj_koothrappali Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.
penny No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.
howard_wolowitz You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?
raj_koothrappali And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
penny Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?
raj_koothrappali Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?
sheldon_cooper Uh, no, thank you.
howard_wolowitz You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
sheldon_cooper I’m fine.
penny Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
penny No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?
sheldon_cooper Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.
leonard_hofstadter He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?
raj_koothrappali Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.
penny Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.
amy_farrah_fowler Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.
amy_farrah_fowler I wonder why that is.
penny I have a confession to make.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm?
penny I’ve never been to a funeral before.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
penny I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.
penny I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.
leonard_hofstadter I know.
penny I feel like I want to cry.
leonard_hofstadter Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.
penny I can’t do it with you staring at me.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
penny No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.
leonard_hofstadter I am not a crybaby.
penny Toy Story 3?
leonard_hofstadter The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.
penny It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
leonard_hofstadter I got your back.
penny Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Ugh, let’s get this over with.
howard_wolowitz Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.
sheldon_cooper Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.
raj_koothrappali You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.
howard_wolowitz Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.
sheldon_cooper Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
raj_koothrappali It was just a suggestion.
sheldon_cooper Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.
raj_koothrappali Wow.
howard_wolowitz I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
raj_koothrappali Should we try to console him?
howard_wolowitz Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
raj_koothrappali By staying here and watching the movie.
howard_wolowitz That’s what good friends would do.
howard_wolowitz Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.
raj_koothrappali Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.
howard_wolowitz Me, too.
raj_koothrappali Maybe we should see how he’s doing.
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
raj_koothrappali But after the cantina scene.
howard_wolowitz Obviously.
sheldon_cooper Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.
arthur_jeffries You never heard it that time.
sheldon_cooper Arthur. I thought you were dead.
arthur_jeffries I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.
sheldon_cooper Why are you here?
arthur_jeffries I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.
sheldon_cooper I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.
arthur_jeffries I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?
sheldon_cooper Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.
arthur_jeffries Well, that, that clears that up.
sheldon_cooper You must be here to give me advice.
arthur_jeffries Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.
sheldon_cooper Those are your Jedi robes.
arthur_jeffries Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?
sheldon_cooper Be careful with that.
arthur_jeffries Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid.
leonard_hofstadter So, what did you think of your first funeral?
penny Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.
penny You think about dying?
leonard_hofstadter Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.
penny What would you regret?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.
penny You know Klingon.
leonard_hofstadter That’s true.
penny No, I meant that as a regret.
leonard_hofstadter I just thought of one more.
penny What’s that?
leonard_hofstadter I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
penny Well, it just wasn’t the right time.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny I know that face. That’s your propose face.
leonard_hofstadter I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.
penny What’s two to one?
leonard_hofstadter I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.
penny Oh, my. It’s not a contest.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.
penny Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I think I would.
penny Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm.
penny No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.
amy_farrah_fowler I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s cute.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.
bernadette_rostenkowski Girl Sprouts?
amy_farrah_fowler My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
bernadette_rostenkowski How did that get you into science?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.
leonard_hofstadter On the one hand, if I say yes…
penny This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?
leonard_hofstadter Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.
penny You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…
arthur_jeffries Where, where, where are we?
sheldon_cooper This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
arthur_jeffries Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.
sheldon_cooper When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?
arthur_jeffries Um, always, get, get a prenup.
sheldon_cooper That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.
arthur_jeffries Well, why, why do you think I’m here?
sheldon_cooper I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
arthur_jeffries Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.
arthur_jeffries Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.
sheldon_cooper Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.
arthur_jeffries I’m, I’m sorry about that.
sheldon_cooper And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.
arthur_jeffries Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.
sheldon_cooper But I do appreciate them.
arthur_jeffries Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?
sheldon_cooper I’m okay. How was the funeral?
leonard_hofstadter It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…? Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?
sheldon_cooper I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.
sheldon_cooper That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.
howard_wolowitz Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.
leonard_hofstadter At least they toned him down in the second one.
penny Yeah, he is pretty stupid.
raj_koothrappali Hey, we can say it. You can’t.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, guys.
bernadette_rostenkowski Happy Star Wars Day.
sheldon_cooper Wow. A Death Star cake.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.
bernadette_rostenkowski And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.
howard_wolowitz Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over.
bernadette_rostenkowski Son of a bitch.
sheldon_cooper You’re back.
arthur_jeffries Yeah, apparently, um, I’m here whenever, when, whenever you need me.
sheldon_cooper That’s nice.
arthur_jeffries May, maybe for you.
sheldon_cooper Why do I need you now?
arthur_jeffries Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you’re, you’re dreaming you’re watching Star Wars.
sheldon_cooper So?
arthur_jeffries I mean, don’t, don’t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you’re spending your limited time on Earth?
sheldon_cooper Not at all.
arthur_jeffries Okay, good luck to you.
