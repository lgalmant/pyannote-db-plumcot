amy_farrah_fowler I’ve never seen him this happy before.
leonard_hofstadter That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
sheldon_cooper Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.
sheldon_cooper Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.
sheldon_cooper I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him.
leonard_hofstadter He thinks there’s a difference.
sheldon_cooper Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.
arthur_jeffries Trust me, I, I remember.
sheldon_cooper This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
arthur_jeffries Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.
arthur_jeffries Oh, okay, I get it now.
leonard_hofstadter Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.
arthur_jeffries Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?
leonard_hofstadter No, she’s not.
sheldon_cooper So, what prescription are you getting filled?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me.
arthur_jeffries I wasn’t going to tell you.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, come on.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
arthur_jeffries Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.
sheldon_cooper But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.
howard_wolowitz Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
raj_koothrappali Actually, I’m busy.
howard_wolowitz Doing what?
raj_koothrappali There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
howard_wolowitz You’re going to girls’ night.
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
howard_wolowitz You know they’re making jewellery right?
raj_koothrappali You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
leonard_hofstadter What’s up?
howard_wolowitz Not his testosterone levels.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
howard_wolowitz How is that possible?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.
sheldon_cooper Goody. What’s it say?
leonard_hofstadter He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.
sheldon_cooper That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.
howard_wolowitz You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.
sheldon_cooper Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
howard_wolowitz It’s true, you’d rust.
sheldon_cooper And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.
amy_farrah_fowler Is it really worth getting upset about?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.
sheldon_cooper That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
sheldon_cooper Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.
sheldon_cooper That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.
amy_farrah_fowler From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…
sheldon_cooper What?
amy_farrah_fowler Doesn’t matter.
sheldon_cooper No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.
amy_farrah_fowler This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.
raj_koothrappali Penny, how’s it going over there?
penny Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.
amy_farrah_fowler How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
penny Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.
howard_wolowitz Hello, everyone.
raj_koothrappali Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.
howard_wolowitz Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
howard_wolowitz So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m making a bracelet.
penny Yeah, I’m just making a mess.
howard_wolowitz You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too.
howard_wolowitz Be right back.
penny When did I have pistachios?
sheldon_cooper Arthur. Arthur. Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.
arthur_jeffries Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, did I wake you?
arthur_jeffries Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty.
sheldon_cooper Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.
arthur_jeffries What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
arthur_jeffries She sounds like a keeper.
sheldon_cooper Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.
arthur_jeffries All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.
sheldon_cooper No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.
arthur_jeffries Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.
sheldon_cooper Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.
arthur_jeffries I should be so lucky.
sheldon_cooper So, uh, what do you say?
arthur_jeffries You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.
sheldon_cooper It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
arthur_jeffries Good night.
sheldon_cooper Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it.
arthur_jeffries You’re annoying.
sheldon_cooper Well, that really hurt.
leonard_hofstadter If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.
arthur_jeffries If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.
leonard_hofstadter Why is it odd?
sheldon_cooper Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.
bill_nye Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.
arthur_jeffries That’s what I told my lawyers.
leonard_hofstadter Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.
bill_nye He said I’d be speaking to a class.
sheldon_cooper No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.
bill_nye What are you guys working on?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes.
bill_nye Oh, that’s interesting.
arthur_jeffries Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.
penny Hey, guys, what do you think?
amy_farrah_fowler Wow, Penny, good job.
penny Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you working on?
raj_koothrappali Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s sweet.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.
penny What’s going on with them?
raj_koothrappali They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
penny Hey, guys.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
howard_wolowitz Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.
howard_wolowitz Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
raj_koothrappali I didn’t know you were coming again.
howard_wolowitz Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.
penny It was not funny.
amy_farrah_fowler So, what tools did you bring?
howard_wolowitz Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.
penny Ooh, that looks like fun.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
howard_wolowitz Okay, who’s up first?
amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?
raj_koothrappali No, thanks.
howard_wolowitz I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.
arthur_jeffries This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God.
arthur_jeffries What, what is it?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
arthur_jeffries Can, can I ask you a question?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
arthur_jeffries Why do you put up with Sheldon?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends.
arthur_jeffries Why?
leonard_hofstadter Wow, you ask really hard questions.
arthur_jeffries Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.
arthur_jeffries You, you know you’re describing a dog.
leonard_hofstadter He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…
arthur_jeffries Yeah, they, they hate that.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.
arthur_jeffries Why, why is that?
leonard_hofstadter Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.
arthur_jeffries Another photo from Sheldon?
leonard_hofstadter No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
arthur_jeffries He probably stole his wallet, too.
howard_wolowitz You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.
penny Oh, that’s amazing,
howard_wolowitz Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger.
raj_koothrappali My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
howard_wolowitz Whoa, where is that coming from?
raj_koothrappali I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
penny Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.
howard_wolowitz How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
raj_koothrappali But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
howard_wolowitz Since when can’t you open up with me?
raj_koothrappali There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
howard_wolowitz Buddy, I was just joking around.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.
howard_wolowitz You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
amy_farrah_fowler They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.
sheldon_cooper Arthur?
arthur_jeffries Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I’m surprised to see you here.
arthur_jeffries Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.
sheldon_cooper I’ll get Leonard.
arthur_jeffries No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.
sheldon_cooper If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.
arthur_jeffries No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. It would be an honour.
arthur_jeffries Oh. Uh, great.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.
arthur_jeffries And, what did you think?
sheldon_cooper Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.
arthur_jeffries Mmm. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.
arthur_jeffries Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.
sheldon_cooper Can I invite you in for tea?
arthur_jeffries Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.
penny Hey, Arthur. How are you?
arthur_jeffries Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt.
howard_wolowitz Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?
raj_koothrappali Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.
howard_wolowitz You didn’t have to do that.
raj_koothrappali Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.
howard_wolowitz Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.
raj_koothrappali Oh gets better.
howard_wolowitz Wow.
raj_koothrappali And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?
leonard_hofstadter He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.
sheldon_cooper Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.
arthur_jeffries So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?
penny Sorry, they’re both married.
arthur_jeffries Good.
penny Mmm.
arthur_jeffries Hap, hap, happily?
