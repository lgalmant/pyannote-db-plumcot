stuart_bloom So, Howard’s really in space, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.
raj_koothrappali Right now, Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.
sheldon_cooper I must admit, I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It’s like a cat in an airport carrying case.
leonard_hofstadter You know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine.
stuart_bloom Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.
raj_koothrappali I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.
raj_koothrappali Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
sheldon_cooper Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.
debbie_wolowitz Howard. Can you hear me?
howard_wolowitz I can hear you without the phone,
debbie_wolowitz Don’t be snippy. I’m just excited to talk to my baby.
howard_wolowitz I’m excited to talk to you, too.
debbie_wolowitz So, what’s this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?
howard_wolowitz How about calling her my wife?
debbie_wolowitz Wives don’t take boys from their mothers.
howard_wolowitz They do. That’s why we marry them.
debbie_wolowitz I just hope I’m not dead from a broken heart before you get back.
howard_wolowitz Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.
debbie_wolowitz Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.
howard_wolowitz Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.
amy_farrah_fowler This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.
penny Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.
penny That’s hot. You kids better use protection.
amy_farrah_fowler How long does this stay on?
penny Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this before?
amy_farrah_fowler Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.
penny Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?
amy_farrah_fowler No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how’s everything going with you and Leonard?
penny Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
leonard_hofstadter Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…
sheldon_cooper You don’t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.
leonard_hofstadter I know what the anthropic principle is.
sheldon_cooper Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?
leonard_hofstadter Where do you stand on it?
sheldon_cooper Strongly pro.
leonard_hofstadter Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
raj_koothrappali I’m all for it.
sheldon_cooper Attaboy!
leonard_hofstadter Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?
raj_koothrappali Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, I’m hanging out with Penny.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. Sounds like it’s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
sheldon_cooper As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I’m having dinner with Amy.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.
sheldon_cooper Darn. If you weren’t busy, I’d ask you to join us.
raj_koothrappali Really? I can come? Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?
sheldon_cooper Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie? Howie?
howard_wolowitz Hey, there’s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?
bernadette_rostenkowski I can. How are you?
howard_wolowitz I’m amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah? That’s nice.
bernadette_rostenkowski It was. Until I found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. Let’s talk about that for a minute.
howard_wolowitz Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?
bernadette_rostenkowski You said you told her, but you never did!
howard_wolowitz Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better.
bernadette_rostenkowski How clear is the image of me on that screen?
howard_wolowitz Pretty clear.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do I look like I feel better?
howard_wolowitz I mean, it’s not, like, HD quality.
bernadette_rostenkowski Listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.
dimitri Like he’s been doing since he got here.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this place is so romantic.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m glad you like it. Raj picked it out.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.
sheldon_cooper Tell him yourself.
raj_koothrappali Yoo-hoo! Over here!
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand. What’s he doing here?
sheldon_cooper I invited him.
amy_farrah_fowler On our date? Sheldon, that’s not okay.
sheldon_cooper Yes, it is. There’s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.
amy_farrah_fowler You found a loophole?
raj_koothrappali Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe I bleached my moustache for this.
raj_koothrappali You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
raj_koothrappali You know, Amy, I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.
amy_farrah_fowler Go home.
raj_koothrappali I don’t understand.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, how could you do this? It’s our second anniversary.
raj_koothrappali It’s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
raj_koothrappali My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I hope that’s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.
penny This is great. What’s the occasion?
leonard_hofstadter No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.
penny That is so sweet.
leonard_hofstadter I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.
penny Go Sports?
leonard_hofstadter Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn’t want to look ridiculous.
penny This is awesome. I love it!
leonard_hofstadter Good, I’m glad.
penny Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.
penny Ah, thank you!
leonard_hofstadter So, where exactly are we in this relationship?
penny Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right, I’m sorry. Let’s watch the game.
penny Great.
leonard_hofstadter I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.
penny Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely. You’re the girl, I’m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’ll get it. Go sports.
raj_koothrappali Hello-lo-lo.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
raj_koothrappali I was, but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.
penny No, we don’t! Come on in!
raj_koothrappali Sweet!
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe I shaved my stomach for this.
dimitri Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.
howard_wolowitz Who is it?
dimitri A woman who says she’s your mother but sounds like your father.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.
debbie_wolowitz I’m not going near that fakakta thing. I’ll catch a computer virus.
howard_wolowitz You can’t catch a computer virus.
debbie_wolowitz Oh, so now you’re an astronaut and a doctor?
howard_wolowitz What do you want, Ma?
debbie_wolowitz Your wife says you have something important to tell me.
howard_wolowitz Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…
debbie_wolowitz Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.
howard_wolowitz Ma…
debbie_wolowitz It’s okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I’m just the kind of person people like to leave.
howard_wolowitz It’s not definite. I’ll talk to Bernadette.
debbie_wolowitz Don’t bother. I’ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I’m no trouble when I die.
howard_wolowitz Stop it, Ma. I’m sure I can get Bernie to come around.
debbie_wolowitz I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can’t let a woman tell you what to do.
howard_wolowitz Okay, okay.
dimitri Oy. I can’t believe these people won the Cold War.
howard_wolowitz Now, can we please change the subject?
debbie_wolowitz Fine. Explain why you’ve been gone so long and I haven’t gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.
raj_koothrappali You know, I’m growing to like American football.
penny Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?
raj_koothrappali Well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?
penny All right, who’s ready for another beer?
leonard_hofstadter I’m good.
raj_koothrappali No, thank you.
penny Girls.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?
leonard_hofstadter That’s great. Get out.
raj_koothrappali What? Why?
leonard_hofstadter Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
raj_koothrappali Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.
penny Okay, hold on…
raj_koothrappali Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.
leonard_hofstadter Some people might say it was romantic.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
penny That’s enough.
raj_koothrappali I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, to this day, she’s never really said it.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.
penny Raj.
raj_koothrappali Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!
raj_koothrappali I really thought she would say it.
amy_farrah_fowler Have I ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis?
sheldon_cooper Every time you drink alcohol.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.
sheldon_cooper Your point being?
amy_farrah_fowler Dessert is served.
sheldon_cooper I just had cobbler.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what? I’m done with this.
sheldon_cooper W-Where are you going?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m leaving.
sheldon_cooper You can’t leave. I need you.
amy_farrah_fowler You do?
sheldon_cooper Yes. You’re my ride.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.
sheldon_cooper All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don’t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that was beautiful.
sheldon_cooper I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll take it.
sheldon_cooper Good. Now, I assume we’re splitting the cheque?
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll leave.
stuart_bloom No, no. It’s okay. Hang out.
raj_koothrappali You sure?
stuart_bloom Yeah, you’re my first customer today.
raj_koothrappali All right. Great.
stuart_bloom I’m, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?
raj_koothrappali What are you drinking?
stuart_bloom Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.
raj_koothrappali Perfect for the night I’m having. Thank you.
stuart_bloom Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.
raj_koothrappali Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
stuart_bloom You’re kidding.
raj_koothrappali She’s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?
stuart_bloom Cheers.
raj_koothrappali Cheers.
stuart_bloom A little music?
raj_koothrappali Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
stuart_bloom Mmm.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.
stuart_bloom Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.
raj_koothrappali I should go.
stuart_bloom Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Uh, thank you for the drink.
stuart_bloom No problem.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Yeah?
raj_koothrappali Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
stuart_bloom Yeah, I-I’d like to, but I’m a little tight on funds.
raj_koothrappali No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.
stuart_bloom Okay.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
stuart_bloom I could do worse.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that’s such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I’m a grown man. I’m gonna live with my wife. My mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.
bernadette_rostenkowski Was she upset?
howard_wolowitz Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks for fixing it. I love you.
howard_wolowitz I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I’ll talk to you tomorrow?
bernadette_rostenkowski Good night, Rocket Man.
howard_wolowitz To infinity and beyond, baby.
dimitri Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.
howard_wolowitz I know.
dimitri What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I’m never going back.
