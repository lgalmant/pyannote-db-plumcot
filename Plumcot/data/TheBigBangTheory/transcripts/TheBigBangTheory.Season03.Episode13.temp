howard Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.
raj Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.
howard A little jealous, are we?
raj No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?
sheldon Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.
leonard So what? It’s the same food.
sheldon Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken.
raj So?
sheldon Yes, General Tso.
raj Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?
sheldon So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?
leonard It’s obviously a typo.
sheldon Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
raj No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
howard It doesn’t mean any of that! It’s a typo.
leonard You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
sheldon Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
howard Sure, no mobsters there.
sheldon You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster.
leonard And why is that?
sheldon It was listed under seafood.
leonard What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
sheldon Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
leonard What the…?
sheldon The TV is gone.
leonard So are our laptops.
sheldon Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books.
sheldon They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.
leonard We like games.
policeman Assorted video games.
sheldon When does the CSI team get here?
policeman What?
sheldon In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
leonard What about me?
sheldon I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.
leonard Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
policeman I’d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
sheldon I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
policeman We’re done here. Call this number, and we’ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.
sheldon I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?
policeman Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
sheldon Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.
leonard How is that going to help them?
sheldon Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
policeman Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.
leonard What are we supposed to do now?
sheldon The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
leonard Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
sheldon Oh, how I wish I could.
sheldon I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
penny I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift, I would’ve run
leonard Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared.
penny I’m not scared. I would’ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.
sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
leonard Hand me the bat.
sheldon We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?
penny It won’t happen again, what’s up?
sheldon Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
leonard We’re fine, Sheldon.
sheldon All right, then. Good night.
penny Good night. That was weird, even for him.
leonard Mm-hmm.
sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
penny Who is it?
sheldon Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
penny Yes?
sheldon May I come in?
penny Yeah.
sheldon I see you’re drinking wine.
leonard Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed.
sheldon Uh-huh.
penny Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?
sheldon Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch.
leonard What do you want?
sheldon It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.
leonard But you don’t like other people.
sheldon I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
leonard It’s getting scary here, too.
penny Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don’t know. Star Wars?
leonard Did we win? Can we go to bed?
sheldon Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?
leonard He’s right, Penny. It’s all there.
penny Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep.
sheldon All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
leonard Great. Good night.
penny Wait, wait, what’s 0400?
leonard 4am.
penny That’s, like, in 45 minutes.
leonard Just keep walking.
woman_on_tv It’s quiet out there.
man_on_tv Maybe a little too quiet.
woman_on_tv Where are you going?
man_on_tv Just gonna take a look around outside.
sheldon Bad idea.
woman_on_tv No, Jim, don’t open the door!
sheldon Listen to her, Jim.
man_on_tv Don’t worry, there’s no one out here.
sheldon Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny!
leonard Who is it?
howard All right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.
sheldon What if they cut the power?
raj There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
sheldon What if someone steals my keys?
raj There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
sheldon What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?
leonard I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
howard Now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.
leonard Where did you get all this stuff?
howard I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
leonard He just gave it to you?
howard I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good.
penny Raj, your car is blocking me… What the hell?
leonard Sorry, let me help you.
sheldon Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
howard Don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.
sheldon Better.
sheldon Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
penny Oh, my…
leonard God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?
sheldon I heard a noise.
leonard It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
sheldon Why would you knock over a lamp?
leonard We were going to have…
penny He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
sheldon Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on.
leonard What are you doing? Use the door.
sheldon Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
leonard Great, you do that.
sheldon Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
leonard I’m lactose intolerant.
sheldon And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?
penny No, thanks.
sheldon Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.
leonard Sorry about that.
penny Ugh, what can you do? Here.
leonard Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
penny Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
sheldon My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
leonard Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
sheldon Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting.
penny Come on, Sheldon, you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
sheldon Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.
penny Is he quitting his job at the university?
leonard Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it.
sheldon All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?
penny Born and raised.
sheldon It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.
leonard Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?
sheldon I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.
howard Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.
sheldon I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
leonard They call themselves Bozites?
sheldon They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
penny Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you.
sheldon Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.
sheldon_on_laptop_screen Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.
penny Sheldon, that’s so…
sheldon You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman.
howard How the hell do I know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?
sheldon That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!
man Help you with your bags, sir?
sheldon Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. Wait! Wait! Excuse me! One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
howard Hey, look who’s back!
sheldon Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
