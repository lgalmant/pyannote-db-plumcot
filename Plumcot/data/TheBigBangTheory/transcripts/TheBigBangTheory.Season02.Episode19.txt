penny Okay, it’s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.
sheldon_cooper Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s not that bad.
sheldon_cooper Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you.
leonard_hofstadter So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.
howard_wolowitz All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.
penny Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.
howard_wolowitz So, there is a number.
penny Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
leonard_hofstadter Shh-shh-shh!
sheldon_cooper What?
penny The people upstairs are moving out.
leonard_hofstadter No!
sheldon_cooper The horror!
leonard_hofstadter Why would you just say something like that?
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no, no, no, no…
penny How else was I supposed to say it?
leonard_hofstadter Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.
sheldon_cooper The horror!
penny Sheldon, I’m sure it’s going to be fine.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not.
penny Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?
sheldon_cooper I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.
penny Well, I’m sure the new people will be just as quiet.
sheldon_cooper You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
penny You’re right, I can’t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you making it worse?
penny I tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it.
howard_wolowitz You’re right, that’s a great idea.
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz I’ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.
penny The horror!
sheldon_cooper Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, that really is how it works.
sheldon_cooper You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?
leonard_hofstadter Raj, help me out here.
raj_koothrappali You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
howard_wolowitz Enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. I’ll come over every night and have dinner with you.
debbie_wolowitz The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?
howard_wolowitz Okay, I get it, you’re angry. You don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest.
debbie_wolowitz Little bird? You’re almost 30, fly, for god’s sake!
howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, it’s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.
sheldon_cooper I guess I won’t be needing this.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here.
leonard_hofstadter Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
leonard_hofstadter The box says kitchen.
sheldon_cooper So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
blonde_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 Hello?
leonard_hofstadter Hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
blonde_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
blonde_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 I’m Alicia. I’m moving in upstairs.
leonard_hofstadter That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.
alicia That’s nice.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it is.
sheldon_cooper If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.
alicia Hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
alicia Freakishly feline?
sheldon_cooper Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon…
sheldon_cooper Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?
alicia No.
leonard_hofstadter You’re making her uncomfortable.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?
alicia What?!
sheldon_cooper I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
alicia I have no immediate plans.
sheldon_cooper If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
alicia Pro?
sheldon_cooper Alicia?
alicia Yes?
sheldon_cooper Welcome to the building.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
penny Oh, hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.
penny Hi.
alicia Hi.
leonard_hofstadter I’m helping.
penny I can see.
sheldon_cooper Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her.
alicia Cool t-shirt.
penny Oh, yeah, I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging.
sheldon_cooper You don’t jog.
penny I can start.
sheldon_cooper True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again.
penny Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome, Penny.
alicia Please, you look cute. I’m dressed like a slob today, too.
leonard_hofstadter I think you look fantastic.
alicia This one’s a player, huh?
penny Oh, yeah, be careful.
alicia Thanks for the warning.
penny Okay.
alicia I’ll see you around.
penny See ya. I’m dressed like a slob today, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”
sheldon_cooper Come.
penny Hey.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.
penny Well, sort of.
sheldon_cooper How does one sort of…
penny I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?
sheldon_cooper He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
penny Oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?
sheldon_cooper In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.
penny Oh, they’re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.
sheldon_cooper It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.
penny Okay, now I see the giant squid head.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.
alicia Cool. so are you in a loft now?
howard_wolowitz Oh, actually I’m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she’s also my maid.
alicia Sounds like a sweet deal.
howard_wolowitz I won’t lie, it’s pretty dope.
penny Hello?
alicia Oh, hey.
penny Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.
alicia That is so sweet. Come on in, let’s open it.
penny Great.
alicia Nice dress.
penny Oh, this? I’m dressed like a slob today.
alicia The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I’ve never had such good-looking technical support.
howard_wolowitz Oh, pish-posh. I don’t know, it means shucks. Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Alicia is an actress, just like you.
penny That is so awesome.
alicia Well, trying to be, but it’s so hard.
penny Yeah, I know, tell me about it.
alicia I’ve been out here three months, and all I’ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.
penny That’s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I’m holding out for the right part.
leonard_hofstadter Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
alicia Whatever you think is best, cutie.
leonard_hofstadter Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay.
penny Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says, “well, I’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”
leonard_hofstadter It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?
penny How would I know? I’m not even sure I get it.
alicia Hey, Leonard? If you’re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, I’d love to.
penny Uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me.
raj_koothrappali Hello there
sheldon_cooper Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm.
penny Well, they’re all still up there.
sheldon_cooper You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.
penny I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all I care.
sheldon_cooper You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.
penny What are you saying, that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?
sheldon_cooper I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
penny Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
leonard_hofstadter Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, what’s the occasion?
penny No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.
sheldon_cooper Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Brown rice, not white?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
penny Yes
sheldon_cooper Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?
penny So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?
leonard_hofstadter You want to watch Battlestar?
penny What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.
howard_wolowitz No, no, PMS is different.
alicia Oh, thank God you’re home. I need help.
leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong?
alicia I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’d watch that.
alicia But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, I’ll take you.
alicia Oh, you’re a lifesaver.
howard_wolowitz I’ll run lines with you in the car.
alicia Great. And afterward, I’ll take you all out for Chinese.
penny Oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…
howard_wolowitz Yum. Starving.
penny …chinese food right here.
sheldon_cooper They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you.
penny I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
sheldon_cooper You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
penny Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
sheldon_cooper May I interject something here?
penny Please.
sheldon_cooper You got the wrong mustard.
alicia Hi.
alicia Guess what? I got the part on CSI.
penny Oh boy.
alicia Something wrong?
penny Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you’ll make a great hooker.
alicia Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?
penny Um, I don’t know, I don’t think a lot.
alicia Yeah, that’s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!
penny Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?
alicia About what?
penny Well, you know, it’s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren’t like other guys. They’re special.
alicia Okay, they’re special, and?
penny Oh, let’s see, how can I explain this, um, they don’t know how to use their shields.
alicia Shields?
penny Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them.
alicia Who says I’m taking advantage of them?
penny Come on, they’re doing everything for you, because you’re leading them on.
alicia So I let them do stuff for me. They’re happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how’s it any different from what you do?
penny Excuse me?
alicia I’ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don’t do the exact same thing?
penny Okay, lady, you are way out of line.
alicia Oh, I’m out of line?
penny Yeah, you’re out of line.
alicia Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?
raj_koothrappali I like green lantern, I’m just saying it’s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.
sheldon_cooper Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
leonard_hofstadter Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
raj_koothrappali Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God! Girl fight!
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz I know you. you’re stupid enough to break it up.
howard_wolowitz May I say you look very comely tonight?
penny Thank you.
howard_wolowitz You’re right, this filly’s been broken.
sheldon_cooper You set it on DTS, didn’t you?
leonard_hofstadter I had to, she called me cutie.
howard_wolowitz According to Alicia’s facebook page, she’s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.
penny Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed.
