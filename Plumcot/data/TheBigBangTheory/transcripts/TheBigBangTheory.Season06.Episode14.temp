leonard Sheldon, your food’s getting cold.
sheldon I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
penny It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
raj So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
howard Let me see.
raj Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.
howard Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.
leonard Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?
penny Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one.
leonard Yeah, so, I’m out.
raj What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
sheldon Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
raj No.
sheldon Don’t waste my time.
leonard You get that these are personalised action figures.
penny Honey, if you want one, just get one.
howard You’re still out, right?
leonard Yep.
sheldon A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!
kripke Cooper?
sheldon Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.
kripke What’s that?
sheldon That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?
kripke I have some bad news. You’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.
sheldon So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones.
kripke No, they’re making us work together.
sheldon That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
leonard Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
howard Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.
raj They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.
leonard A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
howard Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.
raj Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
howard Oh, man. Look at my nose.
leonard Maybe it’s a shipping problem.
howard What?
leonard Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
raj This sucks.
howard I can’t believe I wasted all that money.
leonard Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.
penny I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
leonard Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.
penny Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.
leonard They could show bloopers. Oh, no.
penny What is that?
leonard That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place.
penny Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?
leonard Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
penny You doing okay, sweetie?
sheldon There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay.
leonard Want me to make you some tea?
sheldon Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.
leonard So, cocoa?
sheldon Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?
leonard Oh, teacher! Me! Me!
sheldon See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
penny What beverage do you make for that?
leonard Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
sheldon Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
kripke What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.
sheldon And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.
kripke We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.
sheldon Why don’t you show me yours first.
kripke You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.
sheldon How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
kripke How do I know you’re not going to do that with mine?
sheldon Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.
kripke Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other’s work, meet again tomowow?
sheldon Fine.
kripke Nice twy. This is bwank paper.
sheldon And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
kripke Cough it up, Cooper.
sheldon Very well.
kripke If this one’s bwank, too, I’m going to be fuwious.
sheldon Fine.
raj You! Always bet on black.
howard Get that waste of money out of my face.
raj It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them. He’s right, dawg.
howard Please, I’m working.
raj You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
howard Oh, yeah? How’s that?
raj Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
howard I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
raj Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
howard Yeah, but they’re so expensive.
raj Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
howard Well, the prices have been coming down.
raj Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.
howard And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…
raj Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
howard We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.
raj Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
sheldon I’m fine.
amy All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?
sheldon Yes.
amy Sheldon, what’s going on?
sheldon I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.
amy Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?
sheldon What do we have to lose?
amy How’s that?
sheldon I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?
leonard Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late.
sheldon I can’t go in today. I’m sick.
leonard You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.
sheldon No, look.
leonard 128.
sheldon See?
leonard What did you do, put this in your tea?
sheldon Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.
leonard Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
sheldon Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.
leonard Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.
sheldon All right, geez. What a grouch.
leonard How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
howard Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?
raj I think this thing was made in China.
howard Eh, what can you do?
raj Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.
howard Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
raj And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
howard Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.
raj Oh, I wish I was in better shape.
howard Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
raj Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
howard All right, you can suck it in a little bit.
kripke Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.
sheldon I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.
kripke Don’t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.
sheldon We do?
kripke You have a girlfwiend.
sheldon So?
kripke So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.
sheldon Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.
kripke You wucky bastard.
sheldon What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.
kripke Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we’re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.
sheldon I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic
howard Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.
bernadette What?
howard Say hello to my little friend.
bernadette Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.
howard I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.
bernadette Oh, Howie, I love these.
howard I thought you might.
bernadette Were they expensive?
howard Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.
bernadette How?
howard Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.
bernadette $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?
howard Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.
bernadette At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?
howard It’s kind of dawning on me now.
bernadette I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.
howard What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
bernadette I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
howard Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.
bernadette No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?
penny All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?
sheldon Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.
leonard Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
penny That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.
penny Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
sheldon Of course.
penny You ever going to sleep with Amy?
sheldon That’s awfully personal.
leonard We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.
penny Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?
sheldon Well, word around the university is I’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
penny All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?
leonard All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
sheldon Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy.
penny Then what’s the problem?
sheldon Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.
leonard Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
penny Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
sheldon It’s a possibility.
penny Oh, my God! Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.
sheldon Fine.
penny Oh, my God!
leonard Ow!
raj Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
howard Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
raj Wow, that’s harsh.
howard Tell me about it.
raj Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
howard Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.
sheldon Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant.
kripke Whatever. You get any wast night?
sheldon Yes.
kripke Gave it to her good, huh?
sheldon No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…
kripke Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
sheldon I didn’t notice.
kripke How could you not notice?
sheldon I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
kripke Ah, you’re kiwing me, Cooper!
sheldon Can we get back to work?
kripke Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?
sheldon Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
kripke A wocket? You’we a fweak! I wove it!
