sheldon I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?
amy It’s not the best Best Western I’ve been to, but I’d say it’s the third best Best Western I’ve been to.
sheldon I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
amy What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
sheldon Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle.
amy Okay, well, I should unpack.
sheldon All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
amy I will. I wish you were here.
sheldon At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
amy Okay, I’m glad you’re not here?
sheldon Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.
amy Good-bye, Sheldon.
sheldon Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means I’m available to be entertained, hmm. As today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?
howard Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
sheldon That sounds awful. Raj?
raj Uh, I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me.
sheldon That’s the one to beat. Leonard?
leonard Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off.
sheldon Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.
raj Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
sheldon Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.
penny Hey.
leonard Hey.
raj Hello.
howard Hi.
leonard How was your day?
penny Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo.
sheldon A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes.
penny I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months.
leonard Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?
penny Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know.
howard What kind of doctor is she?
penny Um, a psychiatrist. Why?
howard Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her.
penny Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
raj Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
penny That’s interesting.
leonard I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
raj Low self-esteem.
howard Social anxiety.
sheldon Sexual insecurity.
leonard None of that is true.
penny Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
leonard That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
penny I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug.
leonard What if I get caught?
howard Fear of failure.
raj Lack of confidence.
sheldon Kind of a wuss.
leonard Fine, I’ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.
penny Thank you.
raj Pushover.
howard Spineless.
sheldon Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
howard That was incredible.
bernadette It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.
howard I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.
stuart You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?
howard What is it, Stuart?
stuart Can I come in?
howard Hang on. Should I send him away?
bernadette No, it’s okay.
stuart Thanks, Bernie.
howard What’s up?
stuart Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I’d make it easy on you guys and find my own place.
howard Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.
bernadette So, when are you thinking of moving?
stuart Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.
bernadette Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?
stuart Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.
bernadette You’re very welcome.
stuart Hmm.
howard What?
stuart Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you’re awake.
sheldon What are you doing?
raj Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
sheldon Hmm. What are you doing now?
raj Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
sheldon Oh, I see. How about now?
raj Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
sheldon Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.
raj Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
sheldon Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.
raj Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
sheldon Found one.
raj No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.
sheldon But, look, an optical transient.
raj Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?
sheldon It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?
raj No.
sheldon Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.
leonard Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
dr_gallo Ah, it’s my pleasure. I’m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?
leonard Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?
dr_gallo No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.
leonard Well, then you know her better than I do.
dr_gallo Well, I’m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.
leonard Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?
dr_gallo Well, I didn’t want to say it.
leonard No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.
dr_gallo Sounds like you’re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.
leonard Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now.
dr_gallo Mm. Good for you.
leonard Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?
dr_gallo That’s heartbreaking.
leonard Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.
howard You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.
bernadette Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.
stuart Boy, who would’ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I’d still be here two years later?
howard No one.
bernadette Nobody thought that.
stuart Well, that’s it.
bernadette I guess so.
stuart This is weird.
howard Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.
bernadette Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.
stuart It’s okay. I know he loves me.
bernadette Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in.
stuart I will. And I really can’t thank you guys enough.
bernadette Our pleasure.
stuart Bye.
bernadette Goodbye.
howard He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage.
raj Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found.
sheldon Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.
raj It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
sheldon Maybe it’s a new planet.
raj Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.
sheldon Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy.
raj Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
sheldon Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.
raj A medium-sized asteroid.
sheldon That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
raj I kind of like chicken fingers.
sheldon Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.
raj Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
sheldon I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
raj You dream different than me.
sheldon It is kind of cute.
raj Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.
sheldon We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.
leonard Hi.
penny Hey, how’d it go?
leonard Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…
penny Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?
leonard Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.
penny You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
leonard All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.
penny Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.
leonard So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
penny I guess.
leonard Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.
bernadette Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?
howard No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?
bernadette Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?
howard Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.
bernadette Why can’t it be a woman cave?
howard As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.
bernadette I’m being serious.
howard Well, what do you think we should do?
bernadette I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.
howard Oh. He was so excited.
bernadette Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.
howard I’ll give it to him next time I see him.
bernadette Have you heard from him since he left?
howard No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.
bernadette Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.
howard Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?
bernadette No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?
howard Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
bernadette And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.
howard That was pretty cute.
bernadette Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!
raj So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
sheldon That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.
raj How is that both our names?
sheldon Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
raj Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?
sheldon Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.
leonard Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.
sheldon Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
leonard Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.
raj I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.
sheldon Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.
raj Wait, what happened to us?
sheldon Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid.
leonard Well, what are you thinking of naming it?
sheldon I haven’t settled on anything yet.
raj We haven’t settled on anything yet.
sheldon All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.
leonard You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
raj That is a great idea.
sheldon It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.
raj So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?
sheldon I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.
raj That’s just Amy.
sheldon Exactly. See how well we work together?
penny And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.
dr_gallo Got it.
penny Uh, do you have any questions?
dr_gallo Just one.
penny Mm-hmm?
dr_gallo When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?
penny I just meant a question about the drug.
dr_gallo Yeah, I know what you meant. Let’s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.
penny I don’t wanna.
dr_gallo Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he’s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?
penny You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.
amy Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?
sheldon Good news. You’re an asteroid.
amy Uh, please tell me what to say next.
sheldon Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
amy Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?
sheldon Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.
amy All of them?
sheldon Even the girls.
amy Okay, I think I know what to say now.
penny How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?
dr_gallo I went to college in the ’70s. It was a hairier time. I’m gonna say yes.
penny You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.
dr_gallo Hmm.
penny And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
dr_gallo Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn’t sure if he was real.
penny Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.
dr_gallo Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.
penny I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.
dr_gallo Oh, I’m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.
penny Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.
amy I miss you.
sheldon I miss you as well.
howard I can’t believe I miss Stuart.
penny I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
girls Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
leonard Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.
girls Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
stuart I really miss this.
