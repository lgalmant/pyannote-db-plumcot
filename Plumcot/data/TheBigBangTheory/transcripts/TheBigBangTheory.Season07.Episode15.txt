amy_farrah_fowler Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.
sheldon_cooper I submitted you a notarised list.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.
sheldon_cooper Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please.
amy_farrah_fowler We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day.
sheldon_cooper Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.
amy_farrah_fowler Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.
sheldon_cooper People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.
amy_farrah_fowler I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
sheldon_cooper I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon. Why not?
sheldon_cooper For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.
amy_farrah_fowler One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.
sheldon_cooper Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.
amy_farrah_fowler I got you your own room.
sheldon_cooper What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
amy_farrah_fowler It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
sheldon_cooper Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
sheldon_cooper Vintage? Be specific.
amy_farrah_fowler An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
sheldon_cooper Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
penny No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
leonard_hofstadter Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs.
penny That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.
sheldon_cooper Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, what?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.
howard_wolowitz I don’t own a pocket watch.
sheldon_cooper Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.
raj_koothrappali Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?
penny You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.
raj_koothrappali I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic.
raj_koothrappali Except I’ll be alone.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
leonard_hofstadter We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.
penny Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room.
penny Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you think, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m so glad you like it.
sheldon_cooper I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?
penny Happy Valentine’s Day.
leonard_hofstadter Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.
penny Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
leonard_hofstadter Got you a little something, too.
penny Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?
leonard_hofstadter It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.
penny Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.
penny Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.
penny Oh, that’s true.
leonard_hofstadter In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.
penny That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
leonard_hofstadter To the bedroom.
penny Yeah.
waiter And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?
sheldon_cooper Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
waiter I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute.
man_in_seat_behind#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.
sheldon_cooper Get out of town.
howard_wolowitz Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.
penny No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
penny We gotta get her to a vet right now.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.
penny Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
sheldon_cooper Do another one, do another one.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.
amy_farrah_fowler See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
sheldon_cooper How many trains have you been on?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
sheldon_cooper Wow. Your life’s amazing.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
amy_farrah_fowler Why do I even try?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m gonna fix this right now.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
bernadette_rostenkowski Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 All right.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great. Now there’s two of ’em.
yvette How much chocolate did she eat?
penny A whole box.
leonard_hofstadter Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.
penny So the point is I may have saved her life.
yvette I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?
leonard_hofstadter No. Maybe to her.
yvette How big a box of chocolate was it?
penny Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
penny Do you know how much gas is?
yvette Hey.
penny Sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
yvette You’re the owner?
raj_koothrappali Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.
yvette Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.
yvette Got it. Should have been a dentist.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?
sheldon_cooper Trick question. There never was one.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Or was there?
sheldon_cooper What?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.
sheldon_cooper In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?
howard_wolowitz A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
sheldon_cooper I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?
waiter Better than you think.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room.
sheldon_cooper I never want this day to end.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s feeling like it never will.
sheldon_cooper Come on.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?
raj_koothrappali As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?
penny It wasn’t cheap. It was free.
leonard_hofstadter We’re really sorry. It was an accident.
penny Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.
raj_koothrappali Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
yvette She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.
raj_koothrappali All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.
yvette It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
yvette Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah?
yvette And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.
penny I think there’s something going on between the two of them.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?
howard_wolowitz You okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
howard_wolowitz Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200
howard_wolowitz I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
bernadette_rostenkowski See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.
howard_wolowitz She’s right.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.
howard_wolowitz I had a little to do with it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?
howard_wolowitz I am.
leonard_hofstadter They’ve been in there, like, half an hour.
penny Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.
leonard_hofstadter How long should we stay?
penny I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.
leonard_hofstadter I saw a Thai place next door.
penny Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
leonard_hofstadter How’s she doing?
penny How is everything?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
raj_koothrappali She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
penny Oh, good.
yvette So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
yvette My pleasure. Have a nice night.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, thank you for all your help.
penny Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
yvette Oh, do you guys own any pets?
penny No.
yvette Good.
howard_wolowitz I love you so much.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love you, too.
howard_wolowitz Sorry.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 You guys missed a pretty great time.
sheldon_cooper The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 It was crazy.
sheldon_cooper Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.
howard_wolowitz There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that sounds so romantic.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, give it a rest.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler Why are you still here?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.
sheldon_cooper How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?
sheldon_cooper I get it.
amy_farrah_fowler Leave.
sheldon_cooper What is your problem?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?
amy_farrah_fowler Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.
amy_farrah_fowler That was nice.
sheldon_cooper Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, have fun.
sheldon_cooper Do you want to come with me?
amy_farrah_fowler Really? I do.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Hey, guys, wait up.
raj_koothrappali There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?
sheldon_cooper It was wonderful.
leonard_hofstadter Great. What did you do?
sheldon_cooper I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.
leonard_hofstadter No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
leonard_hofstadter Well, give it a go.
sheldon_cooper I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
leonard_hofstadter Additional data. You dog.
sheldon_cooper I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.
