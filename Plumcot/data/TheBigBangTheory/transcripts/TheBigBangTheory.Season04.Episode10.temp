sheldon Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
leonard It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
sheldon Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.
leonard Great.
sheldon What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer.
raj Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
sheldon Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
leonard No.
howard Uh-uh.
raj We’re good.
sheldon 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?
leonard We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
sheldon Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.
raj Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.
leonard Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
howard Yeah, I get it now.
penny I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.
bernadette Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.
amy Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?
penny Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.
zack Hey, Penny, how’s it going?
penny Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?
zack My dad’s company prints the menus for this place. I’m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ’em easier to clean if people throw up on ’em. Guess how I got the idea?
penny Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.
bernadette Hi.
zack Hey.
amy Hoo.
zack Okay, well, it was good to see you.
penny Yeah, you, too.
bernadette He’s really cute. How do you know him?
penny Oh, we went out a couple of times.
amy I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
bernadette Yes.
penny No, no. But in this case, yes.
amy Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
penny No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level.
bernadette Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
penny Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.
bernadette It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.
amy Hoo.
bernadette What’s the matter?
amy I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.
penny Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?
amy It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.
howard Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
leonard No. What happened?
howard They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
raj Did he get superpowers?
howard No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.
raj Oh. Well, that’s disappointing.
howard Why?
raj Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.
howard Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?
raj Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.
howard Mouse Boy?
raj You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?
howard First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick.
raj Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
howard Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?
raj Yeah, Leonard, who?
leonard 12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table.
sheldon Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
amy It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine.
sheldon Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.
amy Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.
sheldon Thank you.
amy Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.
sheldon Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.
amy No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour.
sheldon I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
amy Oh, that sounds like fun.
sheldon All right. What were the symptoms?
amy Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.
sheldon Localized to what region?
amy Ears and genitalia.
sheldon Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
amy I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.
sheldon Who?
amy Zack.
sheldon Then why did you ask?
amy Ask what?
sheldon Who.
amy Zack.
sheldon All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
amy Hoo.
sheldon Zack.
amy Why do you keep saying Zack?
sheldon Because you keep saying who.
amy I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
sheldon And the answer was Zack, correct?
amy There was no question. I simply said hoo.
sheldon All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.
amy Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
howard There you are.
raj Oh, hey.
howard Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
raj I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do.
howard No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.
raj Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…
howard Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!
raj What the heck is this?
howard A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.
raj Are you crazy?
howard Perhaps. Are you scared?
raj No. But it’s a stupid test.
howard Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?
raj Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?
howard Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.
raj All right, I will.
howard How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
raj It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
howard Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!
amy My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
sheldon How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
amy Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.
sheldon Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
amy I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack.
sheldon Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
amy Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
sheldon A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.
amy Religion?
amy No.
sheldon Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.
amy Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
sheldon Cheap science fiction?
amy What are you doing?
sheldon Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
amy Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
sheldon I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it.
amy And?
sheldon I reject it.
amy You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?
sheldon I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
amy That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.
sheldon Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.
sheldon Hello.
penny Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?
sheldon The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right.
penny That’s thinking ahead.
sheldon The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
penny So how’s Amy?
sheldon Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
penny Oh, no. Why?
sheldon I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.
penny Just going to skip over that insult.
sheldon What insult?
penny Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the
sheldon Forget science. She’s horny.
penny Oh! Okay. Wow.
sheldon It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
penny Are you sure?
sheldon What are you suggesting?
penny I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?
sheldon It’s illegal to spay a human being.
penny Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.
sheldon Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
penny Exactly.
sheldon Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.
penny Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.
sheldon Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin.
leonard Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
howard You got a better idea?
leonard Every idea is better than this idea.
howard Ding!
raj Wait. What the hell is ding?
howard It’s a bell.
raj I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
howard Fine. How do you want to start?
raj I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?
howard One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.
raj Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?
howard That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.
raj No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.
howard Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?
raj What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.
howard All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.
raj Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…
howard We’re starting now!
raj Don’t yell at me!
leonard Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
sheldon Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
amy I’m sure it’ll wash off.
sheldon Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
amy There’s Zack.
sheldon Are you sure this is what you want to do?
amy It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do.
sheldon Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
amy Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
sheldon Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
amy Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs.
zack My gluteus what?
amy On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.
zack Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.
howard I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
raj Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.
howard Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!
raj No, uh-uh, you’re going down!
howard If anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you.
leonard Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
sheldon I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
amy As am I.
sheldon What are you doing?
amy An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
raj You realize you can’t win.
howard I prefer to think that I can’t lose.
raj You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
howard You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch Rat-Man?
raj Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
howard You narcissistic nincompoop!
raj You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips.
