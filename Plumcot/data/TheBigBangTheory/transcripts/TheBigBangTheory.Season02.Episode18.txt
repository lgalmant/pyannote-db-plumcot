raj_koothrappali Knight to queen’s bishop-five.
howard_wolowitz Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?
raj_koothrappali Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?
leonard_hofstadter Ready.
raj_koothrappali Go.
leonard_hofstadter Damn it. I slipped.
howard_wolowitz Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up.
sheldon_cooper Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper – Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock or I punch you in the throat rule.
all@ Ah.
howard_wolowitz Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.
leonard_hofstadter Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked.
howard_wolowitz You underestimate me.
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper It’s eleven am.
penny I know. You’re safe.
sheldon_cooper This package came while you were at work.
penny Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper You have to sign this.
penny What is it?
sheldon_cooper When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable.
penny Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones.
sheldon_cooper Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?
penny It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I’m doing.
sheldon_cooper Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.
penny Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.
sheldon_cooper Obviously, not a cleaning business.
penny No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.
sheldon_cooper Good for you. Sign here.
penny Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore.
sheldon_cooper But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
penny Another waitress.
sheldon_cooper What’s her name?
penny I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper And you’re going to let her handle my food?
penny Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
sheldon_cooper I think you’re just making that up.
penny Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.
leonard_hofstadter Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
penny Fine, cheeseburger.
sheldon_cooper Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.
penny So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?
sheldon_cooper How many of these can you make a day?
penny About twenty.
sheldon_cooper And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
penny I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure.
sheldon_cooper No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.
penny That’s all?
sheldon_cooper Before taxes.
penny Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.
sheldon_cooper I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.
penny And you know about that stuff?
sheldon_cooper Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.
penny Who’s Radiohead?
sheldon_cooper I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
penny Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?
sheldon_cooper Of course I could.
penny Sheldon, wait! Will you?
sheldon_cooper Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance.
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
penny I understand.
sheldon_cooper And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
penny Oh, imagine that.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm. Good-bye.
penny No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!
penny There. Done.
sheldon_cooper All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
penny Pretty good, right?
sheldon_cooper That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.
penny A day?
sheldon_cooper There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
penny That just can’t be right.
sheldon_cooper You’re questioning my math?
penny No, sorry.
sheldon_cooper Want me to show my work?
penny Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.
sheldon_cooper All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.
penny Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide, you’re not allowed to be condescending.
sheldon_cooper That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.
penny All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
sheldon_cooper You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.
raj_koothrappali What’s the matter?
howard_wolowitz I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
leonard_hofstadter Hello?
penny@sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter W-W-Wait, what’s going on?
sheldon_cooper I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
penny Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.
sheldon_cooper Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over.
howard_wolowitz Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
sheldon_cooper Hot glue.
howard_wolowitz You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
sheldon_cooper It won’t work, the flower’s too porous.
leonard_hofstadter What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
sheldon_cooper Intriguing.
howard_wolowitz Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?
penny Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.
sheldon_cooper Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.
howard_wolowitz Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.
leonard_hofstadter She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
sheldon_cooper Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.
penny Yeah, it’s a bitch.
howard_wolowitz Uh, I’ve seen this before.
leonard_hofstadter Where?
howard_wolowitz It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.
penny Ew.
leonard_hofstadter Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
howard_wolowitz Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.
sheldon_cooper Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Oh!
penny I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
sheldon_cooper Wow.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.
penny Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?
sheldon_cooper It’s not my apartment.
penny Wait, wait, what am I going to do?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want.
penny Oh, okay, cool. I’m going to take a nap.
leonard_hofstadter I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?
howard_wolowitz Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, what’s wrong with it?
sheldon_cooper – What’s wrong with it?
leonard_hofstadter Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?
penny Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.
leonard_hofstadter No, it doesn’t.
howard_wolowitz Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
sheldon_cooper Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.
leonard_hofstadter You want to fire me?
sheldon_cooper What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?
penny We do?
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.
penny No kidding. Two?
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
penny Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.
sheldon_cooper Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
penny How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
howard_wolowitz We add Bluetooth!
sheldon_cooper Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
penny Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?
sheldon_cooper Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.
leonard_hofstadter Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
penny Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
leonard_hofstadter The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.
sheldon_cooper Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.
howard_wolowitz And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
sheldon_cooper We should get to work.
penny Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?
leonard_hofstadter Amazon offers one-day rush.
penny Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.
penny Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.
penny I just don’t see how see can pull this off.
sheldon_cooper Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?
howard_wolowitz They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.
sheldon_cooper Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work.
penny You guys get started.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
penny Going online to buy shoes!
raj_koothrappali You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.
howard_wolowitz Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.
raj_koothrappali We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
leonard_hofstadter How are we doing?
raj_koothrappali We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
howard_wolowitz Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?
sheldon_cooper I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
penny So?
sheldon_cooper Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!
penny Nicely done.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.
leonard_hofstadter Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah…
howard_wolowitz Someone’s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow
penny Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper ‘Cause I sold my soul to the company store.
penny Honey, do you want some coffee?
sheldon_cooper No, I don’t drink coffee.
penny Come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs.
penny Leonard, help.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.
sheldon_cooper I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
penny Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.
sheldon_cooper You’re right, of course.
penny Here, this will help.
sheldon_cooper Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother.
sheldon_cooper Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…
penny We should have let him go to bed.
leonard_hofstadter Bam.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe we actually did it.
howard_wolowitz 1,000 friggin’ Penny Blossoms.
penny I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I’m going to give you 20 cents.
howard_wolowitz That’s your entire profit margin.
penny Oh. Then never mind.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.
penny Really?
leonard_hofstadter One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
penny Okay, well. Guess we’d better get started.
howard_wolowitz You can’t be serious.
penny Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
leonard_hofstadter Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
penny Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I’m tired, I’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who’s with me?
howard_wolowitz Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.
penny Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.
sheldon_cooper Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where’s the coffee?
penny We’re all out.
sheldon_cooper No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
raj_koothrappali Yes!
howard_wolowitz Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.
