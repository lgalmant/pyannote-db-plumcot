sheldon Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
leonard Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.
sheldon It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.
howard_and_raj Turtle power!
sheldon However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.
howard Yeah, so?
sheldon I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.
raj an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
howard It’s heebie-jeebies.
raj I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.
leonard Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.
leonard Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.
howard Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
leonard Fun. We know how much you love that.
howard It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
sheldon You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.
howard Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.
sheldon No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.
howard Great, thank you.
sheldon Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.
raj What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
sheldon Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.
leonard That should lighten the mood.
sheldon What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
sheldon Amy. Amy. Oh, right, funeral. Amy.
amy Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?
amy I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.
sheldon You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.
amy Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?
sheldon Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.
amy But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.
sheldon Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.
amy Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.
amy Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.
howard So, how have you been?
mr_rostenkowski Fine.
howard Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
mr_rostenkowski It’s fine.
howard I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?
bernadette I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.
howard I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.
bernadette You could die.
howard Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.
mrs_rostenkowski Here’s another beer, honey.
mr_rostenkowski Thank you.
howard So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?
mrs_rostenkowski It was good.
howard Had no idea you were the chatty one.
sheldon 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
amy Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.
sheldon Well, not with that attitude.
amy I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
sheldon I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?
amy Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
sheldon Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
amy Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.
sheldon How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
amy You, you want to rub something on my chest?
sheldon Yes. All over it.
amy Maybe we should start with that.
sheldon Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.
amy Oh, I’m counting on it.
howard Okay, dig in.
mr_rostenkowski Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.
howard Took the words right out of my mouth.
bernadette So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
mr_rostenkowski I’m going next weekend.
howard Oh, you like to fish?
mr_rostenkowski Yes.
howard Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
mrs_rostenkowski Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.
howard You know, I hadn’t thought of that. Help me.
bernadette Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.
howard No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night.
bernadette Howie, I think you’d have fun.
mr_rostenkowski Fine, you can tag along.
bernadette Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.
howard Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.
bernadette What thing?
howard You know, the thing.
bernadette Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.
mr_rostenkowski All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing.
howard Great. Thanks for the help.
howard I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.
raj If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.
leonard Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
howard Do either of you guys know how to fish?
leonard No.
raj No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
howard Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.
penny S’up?
penny Step one, worms.
howard Ew!
penny Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.
howard Really?
penny You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
howard Okay.
penny What are you waiting for?
howard I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.
penny Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
howard Fine. There.
leonard I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
howard Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.
penny Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.
raj You got this, buddy.
leonard Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.
raj You can do it.
penny That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.
sheldon And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.
amy That was great. Rub my chest again.
sheldon No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.
bernadette How’s the poor thing?
sheldon Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.
bernadette Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.
sheldon Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?
amy I don’t have a bath thermometer.
sheldon Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
bernadette This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
amy Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.
bernadette I don’t understand.
amy I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
bernadette So you’ve just been lying to him?
amy See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
bernadette I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.
amy All right. I’ll tell him.
sheldon Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?
amy I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.
penny Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. You want me to stop?
howard No, I’m fine. Keep going.
penny All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. Oh, my God. What is with you guys?
leonard It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
penny What, never?
leonard My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.
raj Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
howard Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.
raj Yeah, okay, Howard wins.
leonard You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.
howard You’re right. Oh! I should do this.
penny Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.
howard Here we go. Oh!
penny Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs.
amy Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.
sheldon I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.
amy Oh?
sheldon I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.
amy All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.
sheldon It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.
amy I feel terrible I did this.
sheldon It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.
amy I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?
sheldon In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.
amy I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
sheldon Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
amy Are you saying you want to spank me?
sheldon I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
amy That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.
howard Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.
mr_rostenkowski That’s what you’re wearing?
howard No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
mr_rostenkowski Maybe in cartoons.
howard Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
mr_rostenkowski All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.
howard Wait, now we’re shooting things?
mr_rostenkowski I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.
howard Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them.
mr_rostenkowski So, why’d you agree to come?
howard ‘Cause Bernadette made me.
mr_rostenkowski I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.
howard Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.
mr_rostenkowski You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall.
howard So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.
mr_rostenkowski Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?
howard No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.
mr_rostenkowski Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.
howard Really? Thank you, sir.
mr_rostenkowski Call me Mike.
howard Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?
mr_rostenkowski That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about.
howard Great couple of gals.
mr_rostenkowski I wouldn’t go that far.
sheldon Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
amy One second. I want to put on some music.
sheldon Why?
amy I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
sheldon Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.
amy Oh, my.
sheldon Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
amy Then maybe you should spank me harder.
sheldon Maybe I will.
amy Ooh!
