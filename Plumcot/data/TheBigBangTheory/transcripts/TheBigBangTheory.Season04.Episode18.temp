priya Morning.
leonard Morning.
priya Sleep okay?
leonard Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?
priya Sure.
leonard Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
priya Yeah, just because you’re in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?
leonard Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that.
priya No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?
leonard I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
priya Oh, that’s too bad.
leonard Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
priya If you had them on now, you could see what we’re going to do next.
leonard Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
howard Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working on?
sheldon Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech.
raj Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it.
howard Here, shuffle these.
raj Okay.
howard Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.
raj Okay.
howard Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.
sheldon Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
howard Remind me, what’s your birthday?
raj October sixth.
howard Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.
raj How about that!
howard Is that your card?
raj Yes, it is. Very cool!
sheldon It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
howard A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
sheldon Fine. Give me a second.
howard You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?
random_man Oh, hey!
leonard Sorry! Oop!
leonard Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
penny One, two, three, four, five. No way.
howard That’s your card, right?
penny Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
sheldon It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
howard Oh, really? So how did I do it?
sheldon Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.
howard I thought you had more important things to think about.
sheldon I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.
penny Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
sheldon Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
leonard Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.
penny Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great.
leonard Thank you.
priya Lets go hang everything up.
leonard Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
howard So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
penny I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
howard Yeah, I was talking to Raj.
penny Oopsy.
sheldon This deck is rigged in some fashion.
howard Fine. Get another deck and I’ll do the trick with that.
sheldon So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
howard I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle.
penny You know, well, I’m happy Leonard has found someone. Not that anybody asked.
priya How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?
leonard Just two. Everyday and dress.
priya Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.
leonard Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.
priya Leonard, I’m not breaking up with you.
leonard Oh, okay. So, what’s up?
priya It’s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.
leonard I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.
priya I’m just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?
leonard Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.
priya I don’t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you’re not ready to move on.
leonard No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?
priya You need to cut the cord with Penny.
leonard Oh. Okay.
priya You don’t sound very confident.
leonard No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it.
priya Thank you. I appreciate it.
leonard Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?
priya Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we not discuss it?
leonard I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.
howard And was your card the jack of diamonds?
penny Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?
sheldon Um…
penny Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how I got his nose.
howard You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil’s rubber!
penny Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.
sheldon Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic.
penny Come here.
howard You’re right.
penny Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.
leonard Oh, hi.
penny Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?
leonard One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
penny Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?
leonard Yeah.
penny You don’t wanna wash that.
leonard No?
penny No, that’s silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?
leonard Yeah.
penny You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.
leonard Yeah, me, too.
penny She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.
leonard Yeah, bitches are the worst.
penny All right, well I’ll see you later.
leonard Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.
penny What?
leonard Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?
penny Did they make a movie about it?
leonard No.
penny Then no.
leonard All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.
penny Okay.
leonard So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
penny Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
leonard Sure, that has birds in it.
penny It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.
leonard I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.
priya Do you really have to wear that in bed?
leonard Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
priya So did you get to talk to Penny?
leonard Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.
priya And?
leonard She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
priya Was she upset?
leonard Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are.
priya I hope you weren’t cruel to her.
leonard Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?
sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard What?
sheldon I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.
leonard I am not opening that door, Sheldon.
sheldon As you wish. Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed. Did you pick one?
leonard Yep.
sheldon Is this your card?
leonard Nope.
sheldon Drat. Is this your card?
leonard No.
sheldon I’ll be right back.
sheldon Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.
leonard Whatcha doin’?
sheldon I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
leonard What’s up with the infrared cameras?
sheldon I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.
leonard Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
sheldon Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
leonard Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
sheldon Relax, we’re not under attack right now.
leonard Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here.
sheldon And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.
leonard Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
priya It’s okay, I like Indian food.
leonard Or as you probably call it back home, food.
priya Why didn’t you wear your contacts? Don’t you like them?
leonard No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
priya You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.
leonard Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
priya Maybe. What do you think?
penny Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
leonard Small world.
priya You did talk to her, didn’t you?
leonard Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.
penny Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?
priya No, he did not.
penny He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny, huh?
priya Yes, that’s our Lenny.
penny So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.
leonard Bye.
priya Good night.
penny Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.
leonard It is pretty spicy.
sheldon Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.
howard Really?
sheldon Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.
howard I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?
raj Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
sheldon All right. Pick a card.
howard Okay.
sheldon Bippity-boppity-boo.
howard What’s with the wand and the beep?
sheldon The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
raj These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.
sheldon I said, ta-da. Show’s over.
howard That’s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don’t let me see it.
raj Okay.
howard Three of clubs.
raj Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!
howard Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
sheldon That does it. I’m getting uranium.
raj You ever gonna tell him?
howard Maybe. When it stops being fun.
raj So never.
penny Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.
leonard Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.
penny No, it’s all right. Walk me down. So, what’s up?
leonard Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
penny Sure, anything.
leonard Move out.
penny What?
leonard Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.
penny Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?
leonard Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?
penny Oh, for god’s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn’t it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you.
leonard Yes. There, I said it.
penny Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.
leonard And she likes you.
penny No, she doesn’t.
leonard Not really, no.
penny It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.
leonard Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
penny You can hear my toilet flush?
leonard I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.
penny Leonard, I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?
leonard Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?
penny Are you really that kind of guy?
leonard No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
penny Good-bye, Leonard.
leonard Penny, wait. Damned contacts.
howard Incoming.
raj Hi!
howard Hey!
sheldon Hello.
raj Why so glum, chum?
sheldon Apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.
howard Oh, that’s too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?
sheldon Figure out the magic trick yet?
howard Want me to tell you how to do it?
sheldon No.
howard I’ll show you one more time. Raj?
sheldon Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there’s no monkey business.
howard All right. . Two of hearts.
sheldon I hate you.
howard Yeah, he’s gonna win the Nobel prize.
