raj What are you drawing over there?
sheldon It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
howard Oh, you silly doodlebug.
leonard You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
sheldon It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.
howard Do you expect me to build this?
sheldon I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
howard Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
leonard Really?
raj He probably just goes to the bathroom.
leonard Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.
raj It’s sad that you know that.
leonard Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
howard I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.
raj Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.
howard We should figure out where he goes.
raj Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
leonard Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
howard Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
raj It was tapenade and you guys suck.
penny So, how was work today?
leonard Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
penny That sounds like fun.
leonard Yeah, it was.
penny Oh, good, I guessed right.
leonard Who you talking to?
penny Oh, just this guy I met at school.
leonard Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?
penny Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.
leonard I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.
penny Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.
leonard Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.
penny No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.
leonard Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
penny It didn’t come up.
leonard Well, maybe you should tell him.
penny What am I supposed to say?
leonard Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.
penny Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
leonard Yes. Thank you.
penny Mm-hmm. Hmm.
leonard What did he say?
penny Nothing.
leonard What?
penny Did your boyfriend make you type that?
leonard I hate this guy.
penny Don’t be like that.
leonard Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.
penny No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
leonard Really? Here?
penny If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.
leonard That’d be great. Thank you.
howard Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, hello.
howard Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
sheldon No, thank you.
raj Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
sheldon I’m quite sure. Good day.
howard Well, where are you going?
sheldon Where are you going?
raj We just told you.
sheldon I just told you.
howard No, you didn’t.
sheldon Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court.
howard Should we follow him?
raj I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
alex Hi, guys.
howard Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?
alex No.
howard Don’t you know his schedule?
alex All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.
howard Come on.
raj Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
howard This is where he goes? What’s in there?
raj I think it’s an old storage room.
howard What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
raj Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
howard Not yet. What are you doing?
raj I’m listening.
howard Can’t you face the other way and listen?
raj I can’t do anything right for you, can I?
howard What the hell is he up to?
raj He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
howard Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
raj Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.
leonard If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.
sheldon To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.
leonard It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.
sheldon You think you don’t care?
leonard This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
sheldon Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.
leonard What do you mean?
sheldon Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
leonard Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.
sheldon Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
leonard I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
sheldon You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
leonard I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.
sheldon I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
leonard None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.
sheldon Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.
leonard What?
sheldon While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
leonard Now you’re just being ridiculous.
sheldon Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.
raj Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
howard I think we’re more like ninjas.
raj I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.
howard Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
raj No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.
howard Thank you.
raj But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.
howard It’s locked.
raj Are you sure?
howard Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…
raj It’s locked.
howard Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.
raj When did you learn how to pick locks?
howard When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.
raj How did that work out?
howard Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?
raj Hold on, hold on.
howard What?
raj Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
howard Yeah, so?
raj What if it’s booby-trapped?
howard Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.
raj Great, what’s your pl…
howard Are we good?
raj Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
howard I don’t know. The solution to an equation?
raj Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
howard What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
raj He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
howard It’s paprika.
raj Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.
voice_from_outside Okay, good night.
penny Thanks, Cole. See you at school.
cole See you.
leonard I’ll be right back.
sheldon I thought you left a long time ago.
leonard ‘sup?
cole Hey.
leonard You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
cole No, I was just visiting a friend.
leonard Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?
cole Yeah. You know her?
leonard I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
cole Really?
leonard Yeah. He’s ganged up.
cole She told me he’s a scientist.
leonard That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
cole Well, thanks for the tip.
leonard No problem, brother. Stay frosty. We’re still dating, right?
alex Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.
alex May I join you, Leonard?
leonard Sure.
alex Thanks.
leonard Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.
alex Ooh, I love English accents.
leonard Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.
alex It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.
leonard Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.
alex I don’t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.
leonard Trust me, it doesn’t.
alex You sure? You’re cute, you’re funny. Maybe you’re getting hit on, and you don’t even know it.
leonard Really?
alex Yep, pretty sure.
leonard Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.
alex No problem.
leonard Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
raj Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.
howard Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.
raj It’s the atomic number for technetium.
howard That stuff’s radioactive.
raj Do you think he’s building a bomb?
howard Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried.
raj Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
howard Why would you know that?
raj I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?
howard That’s forty-two, dumb-ass.
raj Hey, hey. Feelings.
howard We should stop. I’m exhausted.
raj Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
howard Not me.
raj Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
howard Sounds good.
raj What the balls is forty-three?
howard I have to know!
leonard Hi.
penny Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
leonard Come on, I’m sorry.
penny I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
leonard I do, of course I do.
penny Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
leonard Really?
penny Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
leonard Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.
penny What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
leonard I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.
penny Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.
leonard You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
penny Yeah.
leonard We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
penny That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you’re gonna start crying.
leonard You’re right, you should go.
penny All right.
leonard She loves me. Hey, it’s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I’m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.
howard Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working.
raj That’s good quality video.
howard It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.
raj How did you get your hands on that?
howard Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.
raj Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.
howard What the hell is that thing?
raj I don’t know.
sheldon This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
howard Wormhole generator test?
sheldon The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different.
howard Oh, my God!
raj Holy crap!
sheldon Oh! It’s eating my face!
raj Aah! It’s eating his face!
sheldon I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
raj Sheldon, we’re really sorry.
howard Yeah, really sorry.
sheldon Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
howard But what are you doing in there?
raj And what does forty-three mean?
sheldon You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know.
raj Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.
sheldon One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats.
