sheldon Would you pass the mustard?
leonard Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
sheldon Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.
raj Hey, there.
leonard Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour.
howard Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.
leonard What are you talking about?
raj Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
sheldon Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?
leonard When do we leave?
howard Right now.
raj Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.
howard Wow, okay.
sheldon You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
raj Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too.
sheldon Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?
sheldon Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
howard I told you to put tape on his mouth.
raj And I told you he bit me.
sheldon It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
howard Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting.
sheldon It runs on syphilis?
raj This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.
sheldon No.
howard Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
leonard This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.
raj Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it.
howard I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
sheldon Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
leonard So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?
raj Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.
leonard India.
raj We can drive there.
leonard Your house?
howard We are going to Me-hi-co.
leonard Fun, I’ve never been there.
sheldon Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.
raj What’s wrong with Mexico?
sheldon Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside.
howard Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.
sheldon Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
bernadette Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?
penny Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.
amy Hi.
penny Hey.
amy I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.
penny You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.
amy Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.
bernadette Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.
amy I had extra dough.
penny Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border.
bernadette I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.
penny Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
amy Boy, that was a long night for me.
sheldon Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.
raj We don’t have any of those.
sheldon How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.
leonard If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?
sheldon Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
howard You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
sheldon You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
amy So, Penny, how’s married life?
penny Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.
bernadette You guys still aren’t living together?
penny We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
bernadette Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?
amy Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.
penny Yes.
bernadette Good for you.
amy But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.
penny Yes.
bernadette Good for you.
penny You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.
amy Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.
bernadette Your sweater?
penny Your glasses?
bernadette Your hair?
penny Your shoes.
amy Piercing my ears.
penny Oh.
bernadette You really never had that done?
amy My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.
penny Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now.
amy I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon.
bernadette We’ll take you to the mall to get it done.
penny Why? I can do it right here.
amy Really? You have a piercing gun?
penny No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times.
amy Oh, I don’t know.
penny Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.
bernadette This party’s weird.
leonard Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.
howard Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.
raj Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?
howard I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
leonard Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool.
sheldon It is extraordinary.
raj Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
sheldon I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
howard Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.
sheldon What was that?
howard I think it’s a tyre.
sheldon What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
howard It’s the tyre.
sheldon Leonard?
leonard What?
sheldon I am getting too old for this crud.
bernadette Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.
amy You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship.
bernadette Did you change yours to married yet?
penny Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally.
amy Who?
penny Oh, just my parents and my entire family.
bernadette What?
amy Why?
penny Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.
bernadette What about your sister’s wedding?
penny They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart.
amy How long do you think you can keep it from him?
bernadette Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?
penny Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
raj When did you learn how to change a tyre?
howard Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
sheldon If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down.
leonard And there’s your damsel.
howard Wow, this one’s really stuck.
raj Are you turning it the right way?
howard No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up.
raj Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way.
penny There you go. You’re all done.
amy That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet.
bernadette That’s a joke, right?
amy Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.
penny I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
bernadette Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.
penny You’re not gonna let this go, are you?
amy Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard.
penny Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?
bernadette It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
penny Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
amy Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet.
penny You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?
amy I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
penny Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother.
amy Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.
penny Hey, Daddy.
pennys_dad Hey, slugger. How’s my girl?
penny Uh, good. Is Mom around?
pennys_dad Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she’s gonna make him a little necklace.
penny Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.
pennys_dad You did? When?
penny Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed.
pennys_dad Are you happy?
penny Very. Leonard is so great.
pennys_dad Well, then I’m happy for you.
penny Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.
pennys_dad Well, I understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em.
penny It is. You’re the best dad ever.
pennys_dad Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I’ve been sitting on a little news myself.
penny Well, what is it?
pennys_dad You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?
penny No.
pennys_dad Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.
penny Moondance?
pennys_dad Yeah, he’s, uh, not dancing anymore.
penny You killed my pig?
pennys_dad I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.
penny When?
pennys_dad Oh, ten, twelve months ago.
penny You didn’t tell me for a year?
pennys_dad Well, apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.
bernadette Okay, Amy, your turn.
howard What are you doing?
raj It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
howard Great. He’s pushing with his uterus.
raj There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
leonard Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.
sheldon Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
raj Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
howard Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
leonard Let’s see, a lever, a lever.
sheldon Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.
leonard We’re gonna be here foreever.
penny Thanks a lot, guys.
bernadette What did we do?
penny Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.
bernadette Really? They didn’t eat him?
penny No. He was a beloved member of the family.
bernadette The breakfast meat family?
penny It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.
amy Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.
penny Phone, now.
amy Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.
penny Try dialing.
amy You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?
penny Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.
leonard I don’t think the lever’s working.
howard What makes you say that?
leonard There’s gotta be something else we could try.
raj If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.
howard No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision.
sheldon Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
raj If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?
sheldon Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.
leonard Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?
sheldon Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.
howard We will, we will percussive shock you.
howard_and_raj We will, we will percussive shock you.
sheldon Buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it’s a curse.
raj I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
leonard They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.
sheldon What if that burning food attracts animals?
howard We have plenty of food for the animals.
sheldon We do?
howard Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
sheldon That’s not very nice.
leonard It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.
sheldon What is that awful smell?
howard It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
sheldon What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.
howard Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.
sheldon All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.
howard Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
raj Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
leonard Well, let’s start small. We can always add more.
howard You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match.
raj Hey, look, the lug nut’s off.
penny What? What are you doing back?
leonard We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
penny Oh, I’m sorry.
leonard Thank you.
penny If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.
sheldon We blew up Feynman’s van.
penny My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
leonard I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
penny You win.
