leonard Okay, we’re headed out, see you later.
sheldon Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
leonard Yeah, sure.
sheldon Okay. Go ahead.
leonard Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.
penny Uh, Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada.
leonard Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
penny Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.
leonard Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever.
sheldon Aw, now I’m sad I didn’t hear it.
penny So what do you need the headphones for?
sheldon Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.
penny Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
leonard I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.
penny Yeah, have fun.
sheldon Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.
penny And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
leonard Bye.
sheldon Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay.
leonard Hey, we’re home. Any progress?
sheldon How could there be, with these constant interruptions?
penny I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one.
leonard What are you doing? It’s time to go.
sheldon I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
leonard Ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?
sheldon Like a big old baby.
leonard Call me if you need anything.
sheldon I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
penny Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
sheldon Penny?
penny Ugh!
sheldon Penny?
penny Ugh!
sheldon Penny?
penny Ugh, what?
sheldon You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
penny Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.
sheldon Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.
penny I don’t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.
sheldon And to clarify?
penny The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?
sheldon I’m not going. Would you like to know why?
penny Uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?
sheldon Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.
howard I invented a game. You want to play?
leonard Sure.
howard It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.
raj Go ahead, make fun. You can’t embarrass me, I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.
howard Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it.
raj I may not be liking this game so much.
leonard Cinnamon. Give me another one.
howard Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.
leonard We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.
raj You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange.
leonard Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.
sheldon Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.
howard What do you mean?
sheldon According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.
howard Hold on. What’s in it for us?
sheldon Well, I suppose…
howard Okay, we’ll do it.
sheldon Done.
amy 33 seconds. Okay, that’ll be our baseline.
sheldon You know, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.
amy It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
sheldon And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.
amy All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.
sheldon Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy.
amy Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?
sheldon I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.
amy Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.
sheldon Who eats them horizontally?
amy My mother said that’s how good girls do it.
sheldon Perhaps this was a waste of time.
amy Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for.
sheldon Thank you.
amy And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?
sheldon Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…
amy Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.
sheldon Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?
amy Because you’re happy they’re elevated.
sheldon Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.
raj All right, guys, what game do you want to play?
howard Let’s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?
raj You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships.
howard Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.
leonard That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.
sheldon Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.
leonard So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
sheldon Yes.
raj And you think that’s going to help?
sheldon Yes.
howard Well, I don’t think that’s gonna help at all.
sheldon Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll become more focused.
leonard Howard’s right, that’ll never work.
sheldon Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.
raj I don’t think that’s what you want at all.
sheldon Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?
leonard Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said.
sheldon I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it.
howard Yes, we can.
sheldon Yeah, well, then do it.
howard Nah.
sheldon You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.
penny So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.
amy That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.
penny Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.
amy If I were going to Hawaii, I’d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?
penny Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
sheldon Ladies? Ladies? Ladies?
penny Come in.
sheldon Ladies.
penny What’s up?
sheldon Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?
penny What exactly do you think goes on here?
sheldon Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.
bernadette We were talking about Penny’s job.
sheldon And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.
penny Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.
sheldon You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?
penny Let’s just talk about our periods.
amy No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?
bernadette Well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. They’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. It’s like comparing apples to oranges.
sheldon Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.
leonard What is going on?
sheldon Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.
leonard Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night.
sheldon Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
amy You’ve been working so much lately, I’m glad you didn’t forget about date night.
sheldon Of course.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon Yeah.
amy Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
sheldon I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
amy Fine. How was your day?
sheldon Oh, you said it.
amy Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.
sheldon I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
howard Okay, so it’s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you’re the tiebreaker.
penny Say the quote again.
howard It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras.
penny Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.
howard Yes.
penny Yes.
raj Come on.
howard That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any more.
raj Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.
bernadette Emily’s feelings?
raj Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?
penny Date night.
leonard That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.
bernadette What happened?
leonard He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
bernadette Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?
howard I don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody.
leonard You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
sheldon He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
raj Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.
howard Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?
amy Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.
sheldon That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.
amy I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.
sheldon There you go, perfect.
amy Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.
sheldon But after months of struggling, I’m finally making progress.
amy You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
sheldon Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.
amy That’s not true.
sheldon Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately.
amy Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.
sheldon Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?
amy Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.
sheldon Hmm, perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off.
amy It’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off.
sheldon Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?
sheldon And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.
man Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?
sheldon I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.
penny Okay.
leonard Here we are.
sheldon Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn’t in here.
leonard You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute.
sheldon Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.
penny Now, you just get comfortable.
sheldon No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time.
leonard Maybe in the morning.
penny Yeah, you get some sleep.
sheldon No, I don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me.
penny You’re right, we can’t.
sheldon Yeah, darn straight, you can’t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty.
leonard Little ball of fur.
sheldon That’s not gonna work.
penny Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.
together Purr, purr, purr.
leonard You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.
penny Mmmm.
howard You look like you got some rest.
sheldon Oh, I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.
leonard I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.
raj Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?
leonard Yeah, sure.
howard Yeah, no problem.
sheldon Of course not.
emily So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.
howard Well, um, we were just kidding around.
emily Well, you may think it’s funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it’s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?
