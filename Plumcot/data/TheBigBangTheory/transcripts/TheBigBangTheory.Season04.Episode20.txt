brian_greene My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there’s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.
sheldon_cooper Hysterical.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly.
sheldon_cooper Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
brian_greene You can think about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can’t order the corresponding dish in column B. That’s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.
sheldon_cooper Ba-dum-bump.
amy_farrah_fowler Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you.
amy_farrah_fowler Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.
sheldon_cooper Forgive my language, but poppycock.
amy_farrah_fowler What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?
sheldon_cooper Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
sheldon_cooper I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?
brian_greene Yes?
sheldon_cooper You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
brian_greene Yes, in part.
sheldon_cooper Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?
brian_greene Excuse me?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.
leonard_hofstadter Nice shot.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
leonard_hofstadter Perfect.
sheldon_cooper I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?
leonard_hofstadter Shooting at a target?
sheldon_cooper With what?
leonard_hofstadter An arrow.
sheldon_cooper Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not going to do that, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.
leonard_hofstadter Really? How could you tell?
sheldon_cooper She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t say?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
leonard_hofstadter So, what’s the gossip?
sheldon_cooper Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, don’t tell me.
sheldon_cooper All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
sheldon_cooper Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.
leonard_hofstadter Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games.
leonard_hofstadter – Priya, can I come in?
priya_koothrappali Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God.
priya_koothrappali What?
leonard_hofstadter It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
priya_koothrappali What, what did I do?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
priya_koothrappali You’re kidding.
leonard_hofstadter It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
priya_koothrappali That’s madness.
leonard_hofstadter I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.
priya_koothrappali You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape.
priya_koothrappali Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?
priya_koothrappali You’ll need to explain the game to me.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.
priya_koothrappali Well, regardless, I’ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She’s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.
priya_koothrappali Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.
priya_koothrappali Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Who?
priya_koothrappali My brother. He’s got a big crush on Bernadette.
leonard_hofstadter What? You’re kidding!
priya_koothrappali Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
leonard_hofstadter Wow, that’s hard to believe.
priya_koothrappali Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What’s that piece of tape?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.
leonard_hofstadter Hey!
penny Hey! How’s it going?
leonard_hofstadter Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
penny ‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
leonard_hofstadter I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
penny Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better.
leonard_hofstadter Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
penny You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
penny Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny Well, then who?
leonard_hofstadter I can’t say.
penny Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.
leonard_hofstadter Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.
penny You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.
leonard_hofstadter You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
penny In confidence!
raj_koothrappali Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?
mrs_koothrappali We’re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can’t complain.
dr_vm_koothrappali So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?
priya_koothrappali It’s fine. But if I’m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.
mrs_koothrappali Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren’t you making your sister comfortable?
raj_koothrappali I am making her comfortable. Besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway.
dr_vm_koothrappali What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?
priya_koothrappali It’s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.
mrs_koothrappali Please tell me you’re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?
dr_vm_koothrappali Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that’s not a bad way to go. He’s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don’t drink a lot.
raj_koothrappali It, it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.
priya_koothrappali For now.
raj_koothrappali What does that mean?
priya_koothrappali I’ll tell you later.
raj_koothrappali Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
mrs_koothrappali Who’s Bernadette?
dr_vm_koothrappali Doesn’t sound Jewish.
mrs_koothrappali You can’t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.
dr_vm_koothrappali Okay, we’re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.
priya_koothrappali Thank you, Daddy.
raj_koothrappali Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…
priya_koothrappali Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!
priya_koothrappali Well you should have kept your mouth shut.
raj_koothrappali Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!
sheldon_cooper I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah? What about it?
sheldon_cooper That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains.
raj_koothrappali Are you listening to this guy?
howard_wolowitz Hmm? Oh, I’m sorry. I was somewhere else.
leonard_hofstadter Lucky bastard.
sheldon_cooper Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
raj_koothrappali So what’s up?
howard_wolowitz It’s a Bernadette thing.
raj_koothrappali Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Good or devastating.
howard_wolowitz I’m gonna ask her to marry me.
leonard_hofstadter Marry you?
raj_koothrappali What?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’d wait.
raj_koothrappali No rush, no rush.
howard_wolowitz Oh, great. It’s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what’d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It’s one of the reasons I love her.
leonard_hofstadter Man, he’s going to be blindsided.
raj_koothrappali I know. It’ll be awful.
sheldon_cooper Why are you smiling?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Raj, why?
raj_koothrappali Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo.
amy_farrah_fowler Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
sheldon_cooper No.
amy_farrah_fowler Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
sheldon_cooper Have you learned anything?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
sheldon_cooper If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking.
amy_farrah_fowler By all means.
sheldon_cooper Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
sheldon_cooper I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
sheldon_cooper I’m familiar with everything, but go on.
amy_farrah_fowler Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
sheldon_cooper I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
amy_farrah_fowler I should think so. That’s gold.
sheldon_cooper Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
amy_farrah_fowler Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
sheldon_cooper It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
amy_farrah_fowler We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
sheldon_cooper And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
amy_farrah_fowler Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
sheldon_cooper Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.
penny Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I’m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum’s the word. Gotta go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?
raj_koothrappali I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark.
bernadette_rostenkowski Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?
raj_koothrappali No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Me, too. Good times.
penny Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thanks.
raj_koothrappali This was nice.
penny What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.
raj_koothrappali I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.
penny Well, I know that. How do you know that?
raj_koothrappali My sister told me.
penny Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.
raj_koothrappali None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
penny Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.
raj_koothrappali What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
penny All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.
raj_koothrappali Shut your ass!
penny Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me.
raj_koothrappali How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
penny I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
raj_koothrappali Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hope you’re hungry.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context.
leonard_hofstadter Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
sheldon_cooper Yes, I believe so.
leonard_hofstadter Good, good. Everything okay between you two?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Why do you ask?
leonard_hofstadter No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
sheldon_cooper Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
leonard_hofstadter No. That’s not what he meant.
sheldon_cooper Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you do. You dog, you.
sheldon_cooper Did you get that?
amy_farrah_fowler Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
sheldon_cooper This is moving faster than we thought.
amy_farrah_fowler Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
sheldon_cooper I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.
amy_farrah_fowler Slow down, Sheldon. I’m not quite there yet.
leonard_hofstadter Pass the soy sauce.
howard_wolowitz Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
sheldon_cooper Pun intended?
amy_farrah_fowler No. Happy accident.
sheldon_cooper This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
amy_farrah_fowler I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.
amy_farrah_fowler Pun intended?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. What pun?
amy_farrah_fowler Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.
sheldon_cooper I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is.
howard_wolowitz Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can’t think of a better time than when I’m with all my friends.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times.
raj_koothrappali Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.
howard_wolowitz Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God. What’s happening?
howard_wolowitz I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, let me just stop you right here.
raj_koothrappali This is it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
howard_wolowitz Yes, what?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, I will marry you.
howard_wolowitz You will?
raj_koothrappali You will?
bernadette_rostenkowski I will. I will!
howard_wolowitz Oh, I love you so much.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I love you, too.
leonard_hofstadter Congratulations!
priya_koothrappali Oh, it’s so exciting.
amy_farrah_fowler I wonder what changed her mind.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
amy_farrah_fowler As good an explanation as any.
leonard_hofstadter That’s great.
penny Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word.
leonard_hofstadter You’re pregnant?
amy_farrah_fowler Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
