amy_farrah_fowler This is nice, that we all get to eat together.
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely.
amy_farrah_fowler Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
sheldon_cooper We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to.
penny Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.
leonard_hofstadter What happened?
penny I just got a part on a TV show.
amy_farrah_fowler Congratulations.
leonard_hofstadter What? That’s great. Guys.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah
sheldon_cooper Yay, Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s the show?
penny Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!
leonard_hofstadter That’s amazing.
penny Yeah.
howard_wolowitz What’s your part?
penny Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.
leonard_hofstadter So it, it’s just flirting?
penny Well, yeah. Why?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s wrong.
raj_koothrappali So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
leonard_hofstadter Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
raj_koothrappali I don’t see why not.
howard_wolowitz If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.
sheldon_cooper Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.
leonard_hofstadter It’s a joke.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.
penny Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.
howard_wolowitz We’ll be there.
raj_koothrappali Can we bring anything?
penny Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.
sheldon_cooper Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you think I’m funny?
leonard_hofstadter No. Do you?
sheldon_cooper I think I’m hysterical.
leonard_hofstadter I take it back. That was funny.
sheldon_cooper The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object.
leonard_hofstadter I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
sheldon_cooper Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.
leonard_hofstadter You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.
leonard_hofstadter Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…
sheldon_cooper I don’t get it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.
howard_wolowitz Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
raj_koothrappali I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.
stuart_bloom When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.
raj_koothrappali Are possums cute?
stuart_bloom Not at all.
howard_wolowitz If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.
raj_koothrappali You mean like fatties and uggos?
bernadette_rostenkowski Or maybe just stop talking.
howard_wolowitz I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary.
bernadette_rostenkowski Or just keep dating the possum.
voice_on_television#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.
second_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…
leonard_hofstadter I’m so proud of you.
penny We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
leonard_hofstadter I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.
amy_farrah_fowler Why?
sheldon_cooper I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.
amy_farrah_fowler Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
sheldon_cooper All right.
penny Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.
man_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 I guess it’s you and me, kid.
mark_harmon_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 What are you doing?
woman_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 I’m trying to make peace.
mark_harmon_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 We’re good.
woman_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 Good.
mark_harmon_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 Really? Because…
penny Are you kidding me?
leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong?
penny Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?
sheldon_cooper Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost.
penny No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.
bernadette_rostenkowski What happened?
penny They must’ve cut it.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry.
howard_wolowitz That stinks.
raj_koothrappali I’m sure you were great.
penny This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.
sheldon_cooper I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.
penny No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.
leonard_hofstadter How you doing?
penny Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
leonard_hofstadter You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.
penny Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.
leonard_hofstadter Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.
penny Unbelievable.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.
penny Then what did you mean?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.
penny I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
leonard_hofstadter Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.
penny I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.
leonard_hofstadter Right.
penny Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
penny So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
leonard_hofstadter Honestly?
penny Yes, honestly.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t.
penny How could you say that?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.
penny No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.
leonard_hofstadter That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.
penny Wow, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Should’ve let Sheldon come.
sheldon_cooper This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…
sheldon_cooper BRAIN LESIONS!
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny.
sheldon_cooper Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological… Okay, that’s pretty good.
sheldon_cooper Excellent.
stuart_bloom How about her?
raj_koothrappali No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
stuart_bloom Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
raj_koothrappali That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?
stuart_bloom We’ll find somebody else.
sheldon_cooper Kumquat?
amy_farrah_fowler I guess.
sheldon_cooper Ointment?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
sheldon_cooper Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.
sheldon_cooper Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?
sheldon_cooper All of them.
penny You didn’t get your part cut.
voice_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 All right, baby, here’s the deal.
penny And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Can we talk?
penny We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.
leonard_hofstadter That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.
penny Are you serious? For what?
leonard_hofstadter The new Star Wars movie.
penny What? How did you manage that?
leonard_hofstadter There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.
penny Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.
leonard_hofstadter So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.
penny Really, let it go.
leonard_hofstadter Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.
stuart_bloom How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.
stuart_bloom We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
howard_wolowitz Where’s Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s interesting.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?
bernadette_rostenkowski If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.
howard_wolowitz Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, of course not.
howard_wolowitz Well, I’d be able to tell anyway.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think you would.
howard_wolowitz Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’ll call you back.
penny Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.
penny Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.
leonard_hofstadter Come on. It’s okay.
penny No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.
leonard_hofstadter No, you’re not.
penny Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.
penny No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you have me.
penny You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?
leonard_hofstadter Um…
penny Did you seriously just say um?
leonard_hofstadter Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.
penny Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?
leonard_hofstadter That is not what I said.
penny No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.
sheldon_cooper Who’s in the mood to laugh?
leonard_hofstadter Really not a good time.
sheldon_cooper But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
penny I’m gonna go.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, don’t.
penny No, no, I just need to be alone.
sheldon_cooper So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?
leonard_hofstadter To my room.
sheldon_cooper Should I follow you?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
stuart_bloom How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.
raj_koothrappali That’s a mirror.
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah.
guard Hey, fellas, mall’s closing.
raj_koothrappali Sorry.
guard Yeah. Good night.
raj_koothrappali Uh, excuse me.
guard Yeah?
raj_koothrappali Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?
guard It’s all right.
raj_koothrappali Okay, nice talking to you.
stuart_bloom Smooth.
sheldon_cooper Can’t sleep?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Would you like to talk about it?
leonard_hofstadter Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes.
sheldon_cooper Why not?
leonard_hofstadter That’s a good question.
sheldon_cooper Does that mean the relationship is over?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Why don’t you ask her?
leonard_hofstadter Because I’m afraid to know the answer.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m sorry.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
sheldon_cooper No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
sheldon_cooper No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.
howard_wolowitz Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…
bernadette_rostenkowski How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
howard_wolowitz I’m in the middle of something.
bernadette_rostenkowski So am I.
