raj Water Demon.
howard Ice Dragon.
leonard Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
sheldon Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
leonard Infinite Sheldon?
sheldon Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
leonard Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
sheldon No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool.
leonard Hey.
zack Hey.
leonard Hey.
penny Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
leonard Oh, thanks.
penny Mm-hmm.
zack Check it out, all about planets this month.
leonard That’s an atom.
zack Agree to disagree. That’s what I love about science, there’s no one right answer.
leonard So, you and Zack again, huh?
penny Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
zack Were we here earlier?
penny Okay, we should, we should go.
zack Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.
howard Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?
zack You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it’ll just come back to life.
sheldon Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
zack No, I’m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.
leonard They might be smarter than some people.
zack Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.
sheldon Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.
zack I don’t get it.
leonard A dolphin might.
zack Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I’m stupid.
sheldon That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
zack Let’s go.
penny You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.
raj What the hell did I do?
penny You laughed.
leonard You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
howard No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.
raj And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
leonard That happened to you?
raj First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
leonard I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
howard So go apologize.
leonard Why me?
howard You started it, we just piled on.
leonard What would I even say?
sheldon Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
raj A Milk Dud?
sheldon Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
leonard I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
raj Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
sheldon You’re embarrassing yourself.
sheldon Penny.
penny What?
leonard Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.
zack What do you want?
leonard Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.
zack No, you weren’t. You were making fun of me.
leonard Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
sheldon That’s very hurtful.
leonard See?
zack I don’t know, it still wasn’t very nice.
sheldon Milk Dud?
zack Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we’re cool.
sheldon Junior Mints.
zack You guys want to come in and have a beer?
leonard Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.
howard Leonard’s buying.
zack Really? I haven’t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.
sheldon Literally? Literally a million years?
leonard Don’t.
zack You want to go with ’em?
penny No.
zack Okay, see you later.
penny Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?
zack Are you mad at me?
penny I’m not happy.
zack Milk Dud?
zack Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?
sheldon In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.
zack Oh, no, you’re thinking old-school Archie. It’s much more sophisticated now. Like, there’s two universes, and Archie’s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.
raj No.
zack About time, right?
stuart Hey.
zack Hey.
stuart You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
leonard Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.
zack Wow, lucky you.
stuart Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.
zack Sweet.
stuart Is that sarcasm?
howard Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system.
raj The Archies are over here.
zack Yippee.
stuart So are you guys coming to my New Year’s Eve costume party?
sheldon Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
howard Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
sheldon To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.
leonard Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
sheldon That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
stuart Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard’s mother in high-heeled boots?
sheldon I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
leonard Zack?
howard He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
leonard You can’t replace me with Zack.
sheldon Why not? Penny did it.
howard Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?
zack Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.
sheldon Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?
zack I don’t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.
leonard Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.
raj But I’m Green Lantern.
leonard You can be Aquaman.
raj I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
sheldon Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
zack Hey, babe.
penny I’m still mad at you.
zack Well, you won’t be when you hear the great news.
penny What great news?
zack We’re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year’s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.
sheldon Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
penny Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
howard She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
penny Okay, what about your friend Amy?
sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
penny Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
howard He says he’ll wear it if you’ll be Aquaman.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
leonard You’re jogging.
sheldon This is how the Flash paces.
sheldon I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
howard I’m Batman.
sheldon Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.
howard I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.
raj I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
zack Look up in the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. I forget the rest.
penny All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
sheldon I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
howard Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.
zack Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?
penny No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
zack Come on. We’re trying to win a contest here.
penny Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
zack Penny, there’s no I in Justice League.
howard Well, actually.
sheldon Don’t. He’s making our case.
zack Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.
penny Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
raj Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
zack Babe, open up.
penny I’m not talking to you.
zack Then who are you talking to? Babe?
penny What the hell is wrong with you?
sheldon I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.
penny Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon I understand why you’re upset.
penny Really?
sheldon Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
penny No. Wait, wait, does it?
sheldon Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
penny Good-bye, Sheldon.
sheldon But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
raj Stupid Aquaman.
leonard If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.
zack Whoa. You dated Penny?
leonard She didn’t tell you?
zack She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?
leonard Who else would it be?
zack I don’t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?
sheldon I may have failed.
howard Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.
zack I don’t want to go without Penny.
raj Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
sheldon Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
raj Ooh, I call Kermit.
sheldon I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
raj Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
howard No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.
leonard What makes you think I can convince her?
howard You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.
leonard Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
sheldon Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
penny Go away, Sheldon.
leonard It’s Leonard.
penny Oh. Go away, Leonard.
penny It’s open.
leonard Hey.
penny I’m not going to that party, Leonard.
leonard Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
penny It’s not the wig.
leonard Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.
penny Okay, look. We’re not really me and him.
leonard Then what are you?
penny I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
leonard Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
penny You make a cute Green Arrow.
leonard Green Lantern.
penny Like there’s a difference.
leonard There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
penny Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.
leonard What about me?
penny Nothing. Let’s go to the party. How do I look?
leonard Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.
howard Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.
sheldon Oh.
zack Yes.
sheldon What’s the bad news?
howard Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
zack Aw, damn.
stuart And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!
sheldon Thank you! Thank you so much!
stuart Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.
all Ten, nine, eight…
sheldon No, wait! I have a speech.
