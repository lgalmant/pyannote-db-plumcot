leonard_hofstadter The math is all there. It’s not real.
penny Yes, it is.
sheldon_cooper Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.
raj_koothrappali It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
penny Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.
raj_koothrappali Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
penny Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.
leonard_hofstadter Were you drunk?
penny I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
leonard_hofstadter I think you’re the one who fell over.
penny That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
penny Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
howard_wolowitz Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
sheldon_cooper Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.
howard_wolowitz Come on, it’ll be fun.
penny Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.
howard_wolowitz Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.
leonard_hofstadter It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
sheldon_cooper Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
leonard_hofstadter I want to go.
penny Yeah, me, too.
raj_koothrappali I’m in.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.
sheldon_cooper Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
amy_farrah_fowler We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
sheldon_cooper Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.
leonard_hofstadter You did?
penny Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, you went to a chapel?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
penny We had one of those silly fake weddings.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you know those are real, right?
penny No, they’re not.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, they are.
penny No, they’re not.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, they are.
sheldon_cooper He’s right.
amy_farrah_fowler They’re real.
penny But it didn’t seem real.
sheldon_cooper Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Dad.
mike_rostenkowski Hi, honey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you brought beer for everybody.
mike_rostenkowski Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.
bernadette_rostenkowski You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, the medicine’s not working.
howard_wolowitz You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.
mike_rostenkowski Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?
howard_wolowitz Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.
debbie_wolowitz How can one little toe hurt so bad?
howard_wolowitz Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
howard_wolowitz I have a better idea.
bernadette_rostenkowski If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.
howard_wolowitz I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, well, that’s a great idea.
amy_farrah_fowler No traffic, we’re sailing.
sheldon_cooper Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.
sheldon_cooper Yes, Miss Amy.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
penny Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
leonard_hofstadter Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
penny I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
sheldon_cooper Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.
penny So how do I undo this?
leonard_hofstadter I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
penny Great, well, what do I have to do?
amy_farrah_fowler It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
sheldon_cooper Hah!Penny? Next.
amy_farrah_fowler Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?
penny Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
amy_farrah_fowler Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks for saving the day.
raj_koothrappali Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?
howard_wolowitz Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?
howard_wolowitz He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t be silly, he loves you.
howard_wolowitz Does he?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, he cares about you a lot.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.
howard_wolowitz So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?
mike_rostenkowski Uh-huh.
howard_wolowitz You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.
amy_farrah_fowler Happy Thanksgiving.
sheldon_cooper It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
penny Here. Thank you for having us.
howard_wolowitz What’s with you?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.
howard_wolowitz Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.
penny I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
amy_farrah_fowler You need any help?
raj_koothrappali Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, sure.
raj_koothrappali Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 What?
howard_wolowitz You ever play football?
mike_rostenkowski A little in college. You?
howard_wolowitz No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.
penny Fine.
leonard_hofstadter And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
penny Are you done?
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?
leonard_hofstadter Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.
penny Ugh, I need some air.
leonard_hofstadter Wuh, Penny.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.
mike_rostenkowski Listen to Stretch.
leonard_hofstadter How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
howard_wolowitz Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.
mike_rostenkowski I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
mike_rostenkowski I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?
sheldon_cooper They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
mike_rostenkowski How the hell do you know that?
sheldon_cooper My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
penny Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, you invited him here?
penny Yeah.
mike_rostenkowski I’m getting ready to weigh in again.
leonard_hofstadter Come on.
mike_rostenkowski What do you think they ought to do now?
sheldon_cooper I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.
debbie_wolowitz Did someone say blintz?
leonard_hofstadter I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
penny Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.
penny Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.
raj_koothrappali No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh!
raj_koothrappali My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.
sheldon_cooper I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
howard_wolowitz That’s why I sit.
mike_rostenkowski Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?
sheldon_cooper 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
mike_rostenkowski I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
sheldon_cooper So was my dad. And then he did.
howard_wolowitz Anyone need a beer?
mike_rostenkowski Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Thank God.
mike_rostenkowski So, does your dad still live in Texas?
sheldon_cooper No. He died when I was 14.
mike_rostenkowski I’m sorry to hear that.
sheldon_cooper So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
howard_wolowitz Here you go.
mike_rostenkowski Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.
sheldon_cooper No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.
mike_rostenkowski Well, you’re having one with me.
sheldon_cooper All right.
mike_rostenkowski To your dad.
howard_wolowitz I never had a beer with my dad, either.
sheldon_cooper Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.
raj_koothrappali Wonder what she saw in that guy.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.
amy_farrah_fowler Broad shoulders, good hair.
raj_koothrappali Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
bernadette_rostenkowski How’s it going out there?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
amy_farrah_fowler I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are they doing?
howard_wolowitz They’re drinking beer and watching football.
bernadette_rostenkowski So why don’t you do that with them?
howard_wolowitz They don’t want me.
bernadette_rostenkowski What do you mean?
howard_wolowitz Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…
amy_farrah_fowler Zack’s here!
raj_koothrappali Stir the gravy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
zack_johnson It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.
penny Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.
penny Okay.
zack_johnson I don’t know if I want to sign it.
amy_farrah_fowler@bernadette_rostenkowski@raj_koothrappali Ooh.
leonard_hofstadter Why won’t you sign it?
zack_johnson I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.
penny We don’t have any kids.
zack_johnson Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.
penny Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
zack_johnson Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
leonard_hofstadter You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
penny Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.
leonard_hofstadter That is not true.
penny Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.
leonard_hofstadter You’re the one who invited him here.
penny Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.
zack_johnson Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.
zack_johnson Oh, no. Are you dying?
penny I’m about to. Sign the paper.
zack_johnson Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat.
sheldon_cooper Two, three, eight, four, six. That’s all I can do without throwing up.
mike_rostenkowski That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.
debbie_wolowitz Did somebody say pie?
mike_rostenkowski I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
sheldon_cooper All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.
mike_rostenkowski Me, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
sheldon_cooper She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay.
howard_wolowitz Don’t worry about it.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Ain’t she great?
mike_rostenkowski Mmm.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks again for cooking.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, everything was delicious.
raj_koothrappali Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
mike_rostenkowski Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?
sheldon_cooper This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.
debbie_wolowitz Did someone say pigskin?
penny Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, too.
zack_johnson Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
mike_rostenkowski I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.
howard_wolowitz Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.
mike_rostenkowski Well, I’m drunk.
sheldon_cooper I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
