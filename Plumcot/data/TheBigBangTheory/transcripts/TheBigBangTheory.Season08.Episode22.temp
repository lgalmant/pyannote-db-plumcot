raj It’s, like, the best one they make, I just can’t get it to work.
howard I’ll figure it out.
raj It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
howard Nice. Where were you when I was single?
leonard Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?
penny Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.
sheldon If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed.
amy Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?
leonard Nope. It’s pretty exciting.
sheldon Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
leonard How would I be blinded?
sheldon At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
leonard I’ll take my chances.
sheldon Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
raj Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?
howard Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?
raj I don’t know. Why do I own one?
amy I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny.
leonard Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.
bernadette Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.
amy With a beautiful girl on your arm.
sheldon And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
leonard How’d you get ready so fast?
penny Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.
leonard Why did you need a belt?
penny It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before.
leonard It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
penny So it’s not really like that?
leonard No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around.
penny You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?
leonard Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either. Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled.
penny What?
leonard Yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast.
penny Well, can we get on another airline?
leonard I don’t think so.
penny So, that’s it? We’re not going?
leonard I guess not.
penny Well, that sucks.
leonard Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.
penny Oh. You could tell it to me.
leonard Oh, thank you, but I’m okay.
penny Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.
leonard Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.
penny Ooh.
howard Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.
sheldon All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
howard Maybe we should recalibrate it.
sheldon All right.
howard Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.
sheldon It actually says at least?
howard Yeah.
sheldon Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
howard Sheldon.
sheldon You see where I’m going with this.
howard Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
sheldon All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter.
howard Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
sheldon Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?
howard It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
sheldon Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter.
raj Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?
dr_koothrapalli Not much, just wanted to see how my son’s doing.
raj Very well, thank you.
dr_koothrapalli Are you still dating that dermatologist?
raj If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask.
dr_koothrapalli Oh, and there’s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter?!
raj Oh, you’re where that bill goes.
dr_koothrapalli I’m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It’s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.
raj No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.
dr_koothrapalli No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you’re on your own.
raj But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…
dr_koothrapalli I’m cutting you off.
raj Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?
howard No red and yellow, no red and yellow.
sheldon Yay.
howard It’s green.
sheldon We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.
howard Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.
sheldon Oh, no.
howard Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up.
sheldon Won’t that void the warranty?
howard Sheldon, I have a master’s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.
penny Hi.
leonard Hey, where’d you go?
penny I got you a little something to cheer you up.
leonard Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?
penny Just open it.
leonard A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?
penny Because you are giving your commencement speech.
leonard What are you talking about?
penny I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.
leonard Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
penny Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.
leonard Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse.
penny Yeah.
howard Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces.
sheldon You know what they all do, right?
howard Yes, of course.
sheldon What about this one?
howard Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?
sheldon Not very.
howard That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
sheldon So, can you get it working?
howard I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I’ve built components for the space station.
sheldon I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
howard It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.
raj Hey, guys.
howard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
raj I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
sheldon Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon.
raj I don’t freaking believe this.
howard Relax, it’ll be fine.
raj No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.
sheldon You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
raj What?
sheldon I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
raj Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.
howard Calm down.
raj Okay. Okay, you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. Hello, Mummy.
mrs_koothrapalli Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.
raj Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?
mrs_koothrapalli Such a sweet boy for asking. Can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.
raj Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.
mrs_koothrapalli What does that mean, active social life?
raj Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.
mrs_koothrapalli Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?
raj All I know, Mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy.
mrs_koothrapalli Well, however much money your father was giving you, I’ll give you more.
raj Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.
penny What’s taking so long?
leonard I don’t think this is gonna work.
penny Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.
leonard A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.
penny Oh. Well, you do.
leonard Thank you.
penny Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs.
leonard Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.
penny Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.
leonard Oh. Done and done.
howard Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.
sheldon Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.
howard One toy at a time.
sheldon Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.
raj What’s the first one?
howard Suicide.
sheldon Wrong. Obesity.
bernadette I have the tool you wanted.
howard Thank you.
raj You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.
howard It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am.
sheldon Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.
bernadette Why don’t you just call tech support?
howard Hey.
sheldon Whoa.
raj Not cool.
bernadette What?
howard There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.
bernadette I call tech support all the time.
howard Ha-ha.
sheldon You call tech support.
raj What a baby.
headmaster And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard Members of the faculty, students, I’m excited to speak to you today. I can’t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.
penny Oh. Hello. I, I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school.
leonard They’re graduating.
penny Okay, bye.
howard All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?
sheldon Check.
howard GPS?
raj Check.
howard Battery charged?
sheldon Check.
bernadette Four hours of our lives gone? Check.
howard All right. All systems go. In five…
together Four, three, two, one.
sheldon That’s what my train used to do.
bernadette Ready to call tech support?
howard Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have.
raj It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.
dr_koothrapalli What did you say to your mother?
raj Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay.
dr_koothrapalli Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I’m some sort of playboy.
raj Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.
dr_koothrapalli You think you take after me?
raj Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model. Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?
leonard It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I’m boring myself. Sorry, I can’t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but I didn’t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don’t have any friends. And guess what? That’s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don’t know what they were doing ’cause I was never there.
penny I’ll, I’ll tell you later.
leonard My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.
tech_support_voice Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly.
howard What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.
sheldon It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise.
howard Hang on, hang on. It’s working. I did it.
raj How’d you do that?
howard No idea, but I did it.
bernadette Maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside.
howard Well, I’m not flying it.
sheldon Then who is?
howard I don’t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.
sheldon Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera’s working. Oh, look, it’s me.
tech_support_guy Tech Support, can I help you?
sheldon Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police.
leonard So you really think they liked it?
penny Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…
sheldon Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe.
