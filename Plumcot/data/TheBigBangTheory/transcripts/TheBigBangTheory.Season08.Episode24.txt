amy_farrah_fowler Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?
sheldon_cooper I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
amy_farrah_fowler That’s what you’re thinking about?
sheldon_cooper Well, one of the things.
amy_farrah_fowler Are any of them me?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.
amy_farrah_fowler I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?
sheldon_cooper Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, sure, I’d love to.
sheldon_cooper Whenever you’re ready.
stuart_bloom I don’t want to rush you, but I’m closing a little early tonight.
raj_koothrappali Ooh. Hot date?
stuart_bloom Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don’t have to not ask me twice.
emily_sweeney If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?
raj_koothrappali You’re kidding, right?
emily_sweeney Oh. Is this freaking you out?
raj_koothrappali I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.
emily_sweeney All right. Never mind.
raj_koothrappali No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you.
stuart_bloom Sold.
emily_sweeney Raj, you don’t have to do that.
stuart_bloom Too late. No returns.
leonard_hofstadter That was really intense.
penny Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.
leonard_hofstadter Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
sheldon_cooper What happened?
penny Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
sheldon_cooper Been there.
penny Mmm. So what do you need help with?
sheldon_cooper Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.
penny Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?
sheldon_cooper Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.
penny And that made her angry?
sheldon_cooper Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.
penny Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.
sheldon_cooper It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
penny Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.
leonard_hofstadter I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.
penny Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.
sheldon_cooper Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.
penny Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.
sheldon_cooper If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.
raj_koothrappali You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
bernadette_rostenkowski You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?
raj_koothrappali No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.
howard_wolowitz One more time?
raj_koothrappali She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.
howard_wolowitz Like, a random person or somebody she knew?
raj_koothrappali What difference does it make?
howard_wolowitz Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.
bernadette_rostenkowski The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it.
raj_koothrappali Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.
howard_wolowitz Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?
bernadette_rostenkowski I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.
howard_wolowitz How are you saying that with a straight face?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know.
raj_koothrappali You guys are being jerks.
howard_wolowitz Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life.
raj_koothrappali You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.
howard_wolowitz That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.
raj_koothrappali Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.
penny Thanks for cooking.
leonard_hofstadter Mmm. My pleasure.
penny That carrot was delicious.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
penny Still haven’t heard from her?
sheldon_cooper No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.
penny Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
sheldon_cooper Too slow?
penny Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together.
sheldon_cooper That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
penny Uh, hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny No. Sheldon, we’re getting married.
sheldon_cooper But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date.
penny Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
leonard_hofstadter We’re gonna set a date.
sheldon_cooper Okay. If you say so.
penny Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now.
leonard_hofstadter Really good.
penny I’m focusing on my job.
leonard_hofstadter And we’ve been busy with our paper.
penny So busy.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date.
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
penny You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did you eat all my yoghurt?
howard_wolowitz You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?
bernadette_rostenkowski You know which yoghurt I mean.
howard_wolowitz I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
howard_wolowitz We should have done it months ago.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right. Tonight’s the night.
howard_wolowitz Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, I like when you take charge.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer.
leonard_hofstadter So, why haven’t we picked a date?
penny You know why.
leonard_hofstadter Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?
penny Not in a rush, busy with work…
sheldon_cooper Things are good right now.
penny Really good.
leonard_hofstadter You still want to get married, right?
penny Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?
penny Well, you want a date, pick a date.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?
sheldon_cooper Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
penny Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?
leonard_hofstadter Is your dad paying for it?
penny I doubt it.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, two friends each.
penny All right, well, I want it in a church.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. I want black-tie.
penny Fine. I want to release butterflies.
sheldon_cooper Seriously? Airborne worms?
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.
penny Sounds perfect.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper You still didn’t pick a date.
penny Stay out of it.
leonard_hofstadter Shut up.
emily_sweeney Mmm. It’s a beautiful night.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.
emily_sweeney Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?
raj_koothrappali So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.
emily_sweeney You aren’t scared, are you?
raj_koothrappali Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
penny No, it’s okay.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.
sheldon_cooper Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?
penny Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.
sheldon_cooper Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?
penny Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
sheldon_cooper So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m not a whiner.
sheldon_cooper It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
leonard_hofstadter Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.
penny Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together.
sheldon_cooper My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.
penny Um, I’m free tonight.
leonard_hofstadter Are you saying you want to get married?
penny Vegas isn’t that far away.
leonard_hofstadter I’m in. Let’s do it.
sheldon_cooper After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.
penny Oh, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
sheldon_cooper Now get out of my spot.
howard_wolowitz Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.
bernadette_rostenkowski Right.
howard_wolowitz Good luck.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.
howard_wolowitz Never should have told you my middle name.
stuart_bloom Hey, guys.
howard_wolowitz Hey, you got a minute?
stuart_bloom Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t let that sway you.
howard_wolowitz It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.
stuart_bloom What’s up?
bernadette_rostenkowski So, we need to talk.
emily_sweeney You okay?
raj_koothrappali I think we should talk.
stuart_bloom Is everything okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you’ve been living here a while now.
stuart_bloom I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
howard_wolowitz His middle name is David. Go.
raj_koothrappali Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.
emily_sweeney Are you breaking up with me?
raj_koothrappali No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is…
howard_wolowitz You need to take that?
stuart_bloom It’s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I’ll call him back. You were saying?
emily_sweeney Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don’t expect me to do it for you.
raj_koothrappali End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.
bernadette_rostenkowski@howard_wolowitz Happy birthday to you.
penny Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.
leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t sound very romantic.
penny Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
penny Yeah. This is crazy.
leonard_hofstadter I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
penny Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.
leonard_hofstadter It is. It is about us.
penny And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.
leonard_hofstadter Right. No surprises.
penny And no regrets.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.
penny No, you told me.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, um, well, there was this girl.
penny What did you do?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing really. It was just kissing.
penny And then what?
leonard_hofstadter And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.
penny All right.
leonard_hofstadter Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
penny Nope, never.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s too bad.
penny You know, can I ask you a question?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm?
penny Why are you telling me this now?
leonard_hofstadter Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.
penny Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.
leonard_hofstadter Would you rather I didn’t tell you?
penny No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.
leonard_hofstadter See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?
penny Uh, keep your mouth off other women.
leonard_hofstadter I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
penny Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.
leonard_hofstadter Right.
penny Just kissing.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.
penny Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking.
leonard_hofstadter So, we’re still getting married?
penny Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Because we love each other.
penny Yes.
leonard_hofstadter And it’s the happiest day of our lives.
penny Ha-ha, don’t push it.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…
amy_farrah_fowler I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years.
sheldon_cooper Strongly disagree. Go on.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.
sheldon_cooper Oh.
amy_farrah_fowler I hope you understand.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Bye, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
