wil Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m happy to be here.
amy Cut.
sheldon What’s wrong?
amy Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.
wil Wooden?
amy Don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.
sheldon My friend, Wil Wheaton.
wil Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to be here.
sheldon So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
wil Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what’s interesting about this flag…
amy Cut.
wil What was wrong with that?
amy It’s called Fun with Flags. They’re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let’s try and keep it upbeat.
wil Um, no offence, but I’ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
sheldon It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.
amy You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.
wil So do I.
amy Great. So, this time let’s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.
wil And cut. You realize that I’m doing this for free, right?
amy Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action.
sheldon So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
wil Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
amy Cut.
wil Problem, first-time director?
sheldon Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.
amy He was overacting on purpose.
sheldon Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
wil Listen, Sheldon, I’m really happy to do this for you, but not if she’s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.
amy You gonna let him speak to me like that?
sheldon Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. What do you think?
amy Can I speak to you for a second?
sheldon I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
amy I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.
sheldon Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.
amy Fine. Then maybe I should go.
sheldon Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?
amy You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
sheldon Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.
bernadette Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.
howard Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
bernadette You ready to go?
howard Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.
bernadette I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.
howard What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?
bernadette 50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.
howard You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?
bernadette Because we don’t live here.
howard I know.
bernadette Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.
howard That’s not true.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, I’m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?
howard There’s some underwear in the hamper.
mrs_wolowitz Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.
howard Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place.
bernadette Thank you.
howard The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
bernadette Or in the closet. We can decide later.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, help, my hand’s stuck in the garbage disposal.
howard Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.
mrs_wolowitz Are you kidding? It’s a perfectly good chicken leg.
leonard Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.
sheldon I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
leonard I thought you had plans with Amy.
sheldon Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
leonard Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
sheldon Yes, quite the kerfuffle.
leonard Then Amy got mad and left?
sheldon Walked right out the door.
leonard And you?
sheldon Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
leonard Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
sheldon Why’s that?
leonard Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.
sheldon You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
leonard Trust me, call her.
sheldon Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.
amy What?
sheldon You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.
amy I’m mad at you, Sheldon.
sheldon Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.
amy I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.
sheldon Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?
leonard Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.
amy Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.
sheldon Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.
penny Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.
bernadette Kitchen slammed again?
penny No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?
bernadette So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?
howard Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.
bernadette What’s your excuse this time?
howard No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.
bernadette That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
howard My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.
bernadette Howie, you promised you’d move.
howard And I will.
penny Yeah, right.
howard I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.
penny I’ve seen her burp you.
howard She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?
penny Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
bernadette I’m starting to think you’re right.
howard All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.
penny Wow, excuse me.
howard That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.
sheldon Amy. Amy. Angry Amy.
amy What?
sheldon I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.
amy Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
sheldon First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy… She’s hooked.
raj Wow. An end of an era.
howard Boy, if these walls could talk.
leonard They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?
howard Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
leonard Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.
howard I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.
raj When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
howard Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
leonard Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
howard Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.
leonard We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
howard Fine, let’s go.
penny Hey. What brings you in?
sheldon Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls.
penny I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
sheldon Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
penny And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?
sheldon Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.
penny You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
sheldon Will that calm my nerves?
penny It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
sheldon Sold.
penny Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
sheldon The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.
penny Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.
sheldon It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.
penny Honey, you can’t make people like each other.
sheldon Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.
penny You might want to pace yourself.
sheldon I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.
penny Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
sheldon My problem is I’m out of tea.
penny Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
sheldon Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
penny Sorry.
sheldon On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.
penny Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
sheldon Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.
penny Yeah, that she is. Here you go.
sheldon I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.
penny No, she won’t.
sheldon No, she won’t. I’m great.
howard Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I’ll see naked in the bathroom.
bernadette I know this wasn’t easy. You doing okay?
howard Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about.
bernadette Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman.
howard I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her.
bernadette That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
howard She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.
bernadette She’s lucky you were there.
howard You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was.
bernadette Aw, crap. Let’s go.
howard Where we going?
bernadette Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.
howard No, but I want to live here.
bernadette Well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.
howard Can’t we talk about this?
bernadette No husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!
sheldon Wil Wheaton! Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?
wil Hey, Sheldon, what’s up?
sheldon Wouldn’t you like to know?
wil Have you been drinking?
sheldon Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.
wil Why are you here?
sheldon I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?
wil Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
sheldon You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
wil Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we’re gonna fight?
sheldon My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.
wil Okay, I’m sorry.
sheldon Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
wil Are you okay?
sheldon You’re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I’ll choose. You were so good in Stand by Me.
sheldon Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.
levar Hey, Sheldon, it’s a pleasure to be here. Well, we’ve got some interesting flags for…
amy Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.
sheldon I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend.
levar Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?
