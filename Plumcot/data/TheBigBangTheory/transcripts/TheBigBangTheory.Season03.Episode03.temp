penny Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.
sheldon No.
penny Why not?
sheldon Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
penny Are you fun in any of them?
sheldon The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
penny All right, want some French toast?
sheldon It’s Oatmeal Day.
penny Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
sheldon Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
leonard Morning.
sheldon Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.
leonard Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
sheldon It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.
leonard We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
sheldon I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
leonard No, her bed kind of… broke.
sheldon That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition
penny A homunculus?
leonard Perfectly formed miniature human being.
penny Oh, you’re my little homunculus.
leonard Don’t do that.
penny Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
sheldon I want oatmeal.
penny Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass.
sheldon I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.
penny You know what, I give up. He’s impossible.
sheldon I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”
leonard Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
sheldon What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.
leonard I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
sheldon You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
leonard It’s a…
sheldon Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday.
penny Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim.
leonard Wow!
penny I know. What are the odds?
sheldon Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…
leonard Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
sheldon I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
penny Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you.
leonard Come on, you guys, let it go.
penny Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
sheldon Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
penny Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
leonard What was that?
sheldon You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
leonard It does. But in my experience, you don’t.
sheldon There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
leonard Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable.
howard What’s going on, day dwellers?
penny Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?
howard No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
penny Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?
howard No, no. I’m going out like this.
leonard Howard, what did you do?
howard They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
sheldon You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
howard Really?
sheldon Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?
howard Okay, how about you two? Look, I’ve got some extra tat sleeves.
leonard Why are you carrying extras?
howard Well, In case I snag one on someone’s nipple ring.
penny Uh, yeah, I think we’ll pass.
howard Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?
leonard In this case, you bet she is.
howard Yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.
leonard They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
penny They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
sheldon Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
penny Thank you.
raj I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
howard It’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.
raj Oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
howard Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?
raj No, I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
howard What?
raj Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
howard Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.
raj Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.
girl Good for you.
howard I’m actually much morelost than he is.
girl Nice ink.
howard Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
girl Two light beers.
raj Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?
second_girl What’s your names?
howard I’m Howard.
raj Raj.
girl I’m Bethany.
howard Nice to meet you, Bethany.
raj Yes, very nice.
bethany Nice to meet you too.
second_girl I’m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.
raj Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
penny What’s this cartoon called again?
sheldon And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime.
penny Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
sheldon You’re here a lot now.
penny Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip.
sheldon Thank you. Chocolate?
penny Yes please. Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I… You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
leonard Okay, I know what you’re doing.
sheldon Really?
leonard Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
sheldon Very good. Chocolate?
leonard No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
sheldon Actually, it turns out I can.
leonard Well, you shouldn’t.
sheldon There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.
leonard No, this has to stop now.
sheldon I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
leonard No, you’re not sanding Penny.
sheldon Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
leonard Yes, you’re forbidden.
sheldon Bad Leonard.
bethany So what do you guys do?
howard Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.
raj Goth food.
sarah What’s goth food?
raj Uh… blackened salmon?
bethany No, I meant what do you do for jobs?
raj Oh, we’re scientists.
howard Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.
bethany What are the dark sciences
raj Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
howard Oy vay.
raj That sounds really cool.
howard Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream.
raj So what do you gals do?
bethany I work at the Gap.
howard Really? How about that? I’ve been to the Gap.
raj Yeah, I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.
sarah I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.
bethany Yeah. Why don’t we go somewhere else and have some fun?
howard Okay.
raj Sure, we like fun.
howard We are fun people.
raj Dark and fun.
bethany Come on, I know a place you’ll really dig.
howard Did you bring the black condoms?
raj In my fanny pack.
howard Let’s go.
raj Are you happy now?
howard Not particularly.
penny Oh’ my God, she didn’t!
leonard What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
sheldon Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.
leonard No.
sheldon If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.
leonard You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
sheldon No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.
leonard Forget it.
sheldon Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
leonard I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
sheldon You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
leonard Yes.
leonard You’re not changing how Penny laughs.
sheldon No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
penny Uh, sorry guys, that girl is freaky!
sheldon Come again?
penny Freaky.
sheldon Freaky?
penny Yeah, freaky.
sheldon Have a chocolate.
penny Thank you.
raj Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
howard Uh, yeah!
raj What is your mother going to say?
howard She’s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
bethany What are you going to get, Howard?
howard Well, I can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.
bethany Kermit the Frog?
howard You know Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!
bethany Get the mean little skull, and I’ll see if I can make him smile.
howard Yeah, I’d like the mean little skull, please.
sarah What are you going to get, Raj?
raj With my luck, hepatitis
tattooist Okay, here we go.
howard Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
tattooist That’s just rubbing alcohol.
howard I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!
tattooist I’m putting on the stencil.
howard What comes after the stencil?
tattooist This.
howard Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.
bethany What’s the big deal, you’ve done this before.
howard No, I haven’t, look. I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud.
raj We’re both frauds.
howard Yeah, I think I covered that.
raj But I was summing up.
howard We’re not goth, we’re just guys.
raj Very, very smart guys.
bethany So you were totally scamming us?
howard Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
bethany I’m leaving.
sarah I’m leaving too. Not that anyone cares.
raj When we tell this story, let’s end it differently.
howard What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
sheldon Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
penny Of course.
sheldon Thank you.
penny Mmm, these are so good
leonard Unbelievable.
penny What?
leonard I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.
penny well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
leonard Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late.
penny Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet.
leonard Let’s go.
sheldon Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
howard Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.
raj I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?
howard What’s that got to do with the story?
raj Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
howard Fine, they smelled good.
raj Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
howard Whatever.
raj And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.
howard No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick.
raj I’m sorry. Go on.
howard Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.
raj But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
howard We say they’re in a very intimate area.
raj Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?
howard Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.
raj But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
howard True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls.
raj Wow. What a great night.
howard Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.
raj Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.
howard Could happen.
raj I wonder how they smell.
