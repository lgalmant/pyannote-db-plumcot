amy This is an easy one. You love this guy.
sheldon Me.
amy Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius.
sheldon Still think it’s me.
amy It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him.
sheldon Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me.
amy How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon Oh, Tesla.
penny Hi.
amy Hello.
sheldon Hey, how did it go?
leonard Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.
penny Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.
amy Did they figure out what’s wrong?
leonard Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.
sheldon Why would you have surgery?
leonard Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.
penny Yeah, back off, he’s all mine.
sheldon But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?
amy Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain about his snoring.
sheldon Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.
leonard Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story.
sheldon Very well. I’m done talking about it.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon I believe it was your turn in the game.
amy Okay.
sheldon Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.
leonard I think you could give a better clue.
sheldon I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.
leonard Okay, why?
sheldon I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.
leonard If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?
sheldon Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?
leonard What’s your problem?
sheldon If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.
leonard It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.
sheldon I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly worried.
leonard I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.
sheldon Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.
leonard Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?
sheldon I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.
raj Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.
howard Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?
bernadette Not anymore.
raj Anyway, any ideas on a gift?
bernadette Well, what are some of the things they like?
raj They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.
bernadette He said that to her?
raj Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.
bernadette They’re yours in the divorce.
leonard Hey. What’re you working on?
sheldon Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?
leonard Yeah?
sheldon Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.
leonard Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
sheldon Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?
leonard I’m not allergic to latex.
sheldon Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?
leonard For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net.
sheldon Fine. What about epilepsy?
leonard I don’t have epilepsy, either.
sheldon You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.
leonard Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?
sheldon I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.
leonard Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die.
sheldon You don’t know that.
leonard Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike.
sheldon You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
leonard If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?
sheldon I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way.
leonard Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it.
sheldon Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.
raj Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye.
howard So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.
raj Dude, my parents just split up.
howard What?
raj Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.
howard Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here.
raj No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.
howard You sure you’re okay?
raj I’m okay.
howard You don’t look okay.
raj How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
leonard The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.
penny Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?
leonard He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it.
sheldon 18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.
amy Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.
sheldon Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.
amy It’s nice they’re getting exercise.
sheldon Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.
amy I’m sure he brought it.
sheldon No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.
amy He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it.
sheldon You’re acting odd. Why?
amy I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.
sheldon Tell me the truth.
amy Twenty eight.
sheldon Come on.
amy Fifty six.
sheldon Amy. What’s going on?
amy All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now.
sheldon I see. Take me to Leonard.
amy Just go to work, he’ll be fine.
sheldon Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway.
amy Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much.
sheldon I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.
sheldon Hello.
penny We had a really nice swim.
sheldon Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.
penny ‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?
sheldon That’s for the fire marshal to determine.
penny You had to tell him?
amy He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.
sheldon Is he okay?
penny He’s still in surgery.
sheldon Very well.
penny He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.
amy Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery.
sheldon That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?
penny I think she meant something a little happier.
sheldon I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.
howard Knock, knock.
bernadette Hi.
raj Hey. What brings you by?
bernadette Oh, muffin much.
howard Told you, not funny.
bernadette He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.
raj I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
howard So, how you doing?
raj Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
bernadette Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.
howard Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.
bernadette Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.
howard As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up.
bernadette Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?
raj I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.
bernadette It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?
penny Oh, it’s nice you got him that.
sheldon Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.
amy Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
sheldon You know those confounded things make me dizzy.
amy Who told you to keep going around?
sheldon There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.
penny Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time.
amy Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself.
sheldon It was like a grapefruit.
amy And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
sheldon Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.
penny Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.
sheldon The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.
penny Really? You won’t even say A?
sheldon You bet your sweet B I won’t.
penny Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
sheldon And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.
penny Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.
sheldon A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he’s okay.
amy Sheldon, you can’t go back there.
sheldon Try and stop me.
amy Are you okay?
sheldon Why didn’t you stop me?
bernadette Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.
howard What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj.
bernadette What?
howard They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on.
bernadette I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us.
howard How can I convince you it won’t?
bernadette Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?
howard I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.
bernadette So there are things you don’t like.
howard And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off.
bernadette Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad.
howard Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful.
bernadette Oh. Howie, be serious.
howard Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel.
bernadette Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.
howard I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…
bernadette Who were you in couples therapy with?
howard Not important.
bernadette Was it your mom?
howard Not important.
bernadette It was your mom.
howard Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.
bernadette Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that.
howard All right.
bernadette Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.
howard Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent.
bernadette And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.
howard I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that.
bernadette Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that.
howard See, I am. Isn’t this great?
penny Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.
sheldon You know this is all your fault.
leonard How is it my fault?
sheldon I told you not to get the surgery.
leonard Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn’t even want you there.
sheldon Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you.
amy Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.
penny Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny.
leonard Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
sheldon Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.
leonard I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose spider.
penny Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him.
amy Sheldon will move out eventually.
penny Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.
sheldon I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.
leonard You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
sheldon Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.
bernadette I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair.
howard I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
bernadette I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.
howard And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s like washing myself with a hamster.
raj Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.
bernadette Oh, how is she?
raj Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?
howard We’re just saying all the things we love about each other.
raj Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.
leonard Oh, what’d you get?
sheldon Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in.
penny Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back.
sheldon I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”
leonard That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers.
penny Hey, why did you get two? I’m with stupid.
sheldon Oh, that one’s mine.
