raj So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.
leonard Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.
raj No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
sheldon I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.
amy We’re sorry, Rajesh.
bernadette Maybe we can do it next week.
howard Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.
raj Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.
leonard Great.
sheldon Thank you.
howard Hallelujah.
raj Because I’ve got something even better planned.
leonard Aw.
howard Why?
sheldon Come on.
raj Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
howard Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.
leonard We did them at Princeton, too.
howard Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.
sheldon That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.
amy Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.
penny I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
leonard Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…
howard And Princeton.
leonard A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.
penny Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.
raj So, uh, who’s in?
leonard I think it sounds fun.
amy Yeah, me, too.
various I’m in, let’s do it.
sheldon I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
leonard What’s all this?
sheldon Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.
leonard You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
sheldon Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.
raj Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
sheldon He is a born showman.
raj Any questions?
howard Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?
leonard It’s not funny.
sheldon No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.
leonard Ha-ha.
sheldon Oh, see? Now he gets it.
raj Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
bernadette Should we just do couples?
leonard Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
penny Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.
leonard I just said, couples sound great.
penny Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.
leonard All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.
penny No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!
sheldon Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?
amy Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
penny Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
amy Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
penny All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.
sheldon Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?
penny No.
sheldon It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.
raj All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.
sheldon What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
penny Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.
sheldon Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.
howard Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.
amy I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.
howard If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake.
amy I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.
howard Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?
amy No.
howard Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
bernadette Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!
leonard Stop yelling at me.
bernadette Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.
penny Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.
sheldon But we haven’t finished the puzzle.
penny But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.
sheldon You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?
penny Okay, it’s not gonna say that.
sheldon Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.
howard It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.
bernadette Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.
penny It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.
sheldon It’s the comic book store.
leonard Do you think Penny’s mad at me?
bernadette Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.
leonard No, because I didn’t want her on my team.
bernadette I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
leonard Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.
bernadette Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?
amy I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.
howard Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?
amy Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.
howard Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.
amy Such as?
howard I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.
amy Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…
howard Hey, how about some music?
amy Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.
howard Find something you like.
amy Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?
howard Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.
amy I love Neil Diamond.
both Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…
raj Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.
stuart Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.
raj Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.
amy Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.
raj Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
bernadette Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.
leonard I have asthma. Back off.
howard Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.
raj Good riddle, huh?
stuart Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?
raj I invited you to my murder mystery party.
stuart No, you didn’t.
raj Oh.
penny Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.
sheldon It is a marathon, not a sprint.
penny People run in a marathon.
sheldon Not with a bowling ball on their back.
leonard Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.
bernadette Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.
leonard Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.
penny Riddle me this…
sheldon Got it.
penny Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
sheldon I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
howard Hey, you know what this could mean .
amy Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be
howard That’s it.
amy To the Neil Mobile.
bernadette I knew it, we’re gonna lose.
leonard Wait, I got it. I got it/
bernadette Congratulations, you got it last.
leonard You’re really mean, you know that?
stuart So no one’s gonna buy anything.
penny Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.
sheldon The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
penny Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?
sheldon Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?
penny Yes.
sheldon Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.
penny Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
sheldon And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…
penny Shut up. I solved it.
sheldon Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.
penny Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?
sheldon No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.
howard On the boats and on the planes.
amy They’re coming to America.
howard Never looking back again.
amy They’re coming to America… ♪
leonard Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car.
bernadette Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things.
leonard Uh-huh. Like death?
bernadette Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.
leonard Penny’s not answering my texts.
bernadette Who cares? Focus on the game.
leonard This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.
bernadette No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
leonard Why?
bernadette Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.
leonard What does she think I am?
bernadette How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.
leonard I can’t believe she would say that about me.
bernadette If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.
howard They’re coming to America, They’re coming to America.
amy Today!
howard Today!
together Today! Today!
sheldon Okay, another 30 feet.
penny Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley.
sheldon Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.
howard Love on the rocks.
amy Ain’t no big surprise.
howard Just pour me a drink.
amy And I’ll tell you some lies.
leonard Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that.
bernadette Can you reach the clue?
leonard Almost.
bernadette Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.
leonard Got it.
bernadette Great, climb back up. Come on.
leonard Yeah, Penny might be onto something.
sheldon To the planetarium.
penny Let’s go.
leonard To the tar pits.
bernadette Let’s go.
amy There’s a Neil Diamond concert next month.
howard Let’s go.
penny Three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here.
sheldon It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.
penny What? Why me?
sheldon Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
bernadette They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
penny Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
leonard The clue must be in the bag.
penny It’s just a bunch of pants.
leonard It’s just a bunch of pants.
penny You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team.
leonard Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon.
penny What are you talking about?
leonard You know exactly what I’m talking about.
bernadette No, she doesn’t. I just made that up.
leonard Why would you do that?
bernadette Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.
sheldon I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.
penny Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass.
bernadette Wish I had a man like her on my team.
leonard Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this.
sheldon Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt.
penny Oh.
sheldon Hey, that’s my shirt.
leonard This one is, too.
sheldon No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it.
penny But wait. So does this one.
bernadette Maybe the spot’s the clue.
penny Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.
sheldon Oh, that’s clever.
penny Hurry.
sheldon Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.
bernadette Stop her, Leonard, stop her.
penny Well, where the hell’s the coin?
leonard Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?
raj Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.
bernadette Then where’s the coin?
raj Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
penny I don’t get it.
raj Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner.
leonard Are you kidding me?
penny That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
bernadette You suck so hard.
raj Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.
penny Run.
raj Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.
penny Run to India.
raj I just wanted to do something beautiful.
sheldon Hey, look. I won.
howard Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,
amy She got the way to groove me.
howard Cherry, baby
amy She got the way to move me, honey.
