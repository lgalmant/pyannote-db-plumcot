sheldon What are you doing?
leonard Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
sheldon It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
leonard Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
sheldon All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?
leonard That doesn’t sound like mocking.
sheldon You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
leonard I don’t know. Why?
sheldon Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
leonard Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…
sheldon Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
leonard Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.
sheldon As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
leonard Oh, good.
sheldon Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.
leonard A hobby?
sheldon Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
leonard You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
sheldon When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
leonard You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
sheldon Don’t you like Amy?
leonard Of course I like Amy.
sheldon Well, there’s the difference.
leonard Excuse me, that’s Priya.
priya Hi, Leonard.
leonard Hey, honey.
priya I miss you.
leonard Oh, I miss you, too.
sheldon I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
sheldon Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
penny Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.
sheldon If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
penny I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
sheldon A good wife would go to the store.
penny I want a divorce.
sheldon Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.
penny It’s great, isn’t it?
sheldon It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.
penny What name?
sheldon Chair.
penny Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.
sheldon What?
penny Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
sheldon Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
penny What is wrong?
sheldon I’ve been sitting in garbage!
penny Sheldon, take it easy.
sheldon You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
penny I went into this marriage with so much hope.
sheldon There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
raj This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
howard Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.
leonard That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
howard Hang on.
raj Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
howard Hand me the tuna melt.
leonard Yep.
howard Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
leonard Not easy, but we’re making it work.
howard When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?
leonard What?
howard You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.
raj Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.
howard Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.
leonard There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
howard Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.
leonard I can’t do that.
howard Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.
raj How can you be so racist?
howard Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.
sheldon Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.
leonard I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.
howard Just his head, right?
leonard I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
sheldon Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
leonard Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
sheldon Name one time I’ve ever done that.
leonard How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
sheldon I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Yello.
sheldon You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
penny Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
sheldon Really?
penny Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
sheldon It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
penny Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?
sheldon All right. It is a comfortable chair.
penny Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
sheldon No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.
leonard It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s up, buttercup?
sheldon You have to get rid of the chair.
penny Nope.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s the word, hummingbird?
sheldon For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.
penny No.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s the gist, physicist?
sheldon Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. . Penny. Penny. Penny.
leonard So, here we are. Back in bed together.
priya Yep, here we are.
leonard Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.
priya All right.
leonard Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?
priya What?
leonard Not good?
priya That’s terrible. Try again.
leonard Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?
priya Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
leonard Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!
priya God, Leonard, stop talking.
leonard Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
priya Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.
leonard Okay, like usual. Good.
priya Take off your shirt.
leonard All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
priya I said be quiet.
leonard Yes, ma’am.
priya Now take off your shorts.
leonard Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!
priya Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.
leonard Cool. Uh-oh!
priya Here I am, baby. You miss these?
leonard Oh, damn it!
priya Oh, Leonard! Already?
leonard No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.
priya Fine.
leonard So, how are your mom and dad?
priya Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.
leonard Yeah. Sure, sure.
sheldon If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.
leonard Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
sheldon You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
amy Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…
sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
amy Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
sheldon Is not. Is not, is not.
amy Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.
sheldon Thank you.
amy Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
sheldon No.
amy How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…
sheldon No.
amy Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?
sheldon You’re good friends with Penny, right?
amy Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.
sheldon I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
amy For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?
sheldon Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
amy Yes, I am.
sheldon Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
amy Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.
sheldon All right, name your price.
amy Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.
sheldon You mean like Salt Lake City?
amy Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.
sheldon Thank you.
amy Will you listen to me play my harp now?
sheldon No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!
leonard I don’t know about this, Howard.
howard What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. Give it a try.
leonard I don’t think so.
raj I’ll try it. Like this?
howard Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.
raj Like this?
howard Close. Really French it.
raj Better?
howard Yeah, you got it, you got it.
raj I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
howard Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
raj I, I nibbled. I was being playful.
howard Why do you have to make everything weird?
raj Sorry. Better?
howard Oh, yeah.
penny Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.
amy I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
penny You’re kidding.
amy Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
penny And now me.
amy I just have one question about the chair.
penny And what’s that?
amy Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
penny No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
amy No, he didn’t.
penny Really?
amy Yes, he did. He absolutely did.
penny My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.
amy It is?
penny Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
amy No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.
penny I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.
amy No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!
penny What’s wrong?
amy Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!
penny Wait. Get up, get up! Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!
amy I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!
penny Yeah, sure!
leonard Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.
priya Oh, Leonard, listen…
leonard No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
priya Leonard…
leonard That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.
priya My parents are here.
dr_koothrappali Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.
howard Check it out. Free chair.
raj Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
howard On three?
together Three!
raj What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
