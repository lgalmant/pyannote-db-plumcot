penny Wow, you’re really good at this.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid.
penny How you doing over there?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.
penny Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out.
leonard_hofstadter Where?
sheldon_cooper Texas.
amy_farrah_fowler Right now? Why?
leonard_hofstadter Is someone sick?
sheldon_cooper Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.
penny Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.
amy_farrah_fowler How come you never said she was pregnant?
sheldon_cooper Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?
leonard_hofstadter Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.
sheldon_cooper Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.
penny Wow, so, how long will you be gone?
sheldon_cooper Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?
amy_farrah_fowler Can I give you a ride to the airport?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.
leonard_hofstadter All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.
penny Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.
leonard_hofstadter And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
penny Ah.
raj_koothrappali Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?
leonard_hofstadter I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people.
howard_wolowitz I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good idea, I’ll take a picture.
penny Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.
leonard_hofstadter I love it.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter But it is what you got me last year.
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter And last night.
stuart_bloom Hello.
various#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc
stuart_bloom Oh, good, I’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it’s, it’s seven, but that’s fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, it’s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody’s here, say hi.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
howard_wolowitz Howdy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
stuart_bloom Hello.
sheldon_cooper The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, kinda.
sheldon_cooper That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.
penny Hey, how’s your sister?
sheldon_cooper <i>She went into labor an hour ago.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s wonderful. So you’re at the hospital?
sheldon_cooper No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available.
raj_koothrappali You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
sheldon_cooper And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.
mary_cooper Shelly, come on. Your sister’s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there’s blood everywhere.
sheldon_cooper Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.
raj_koothrappali If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
penny Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, I’ll give you ten dollars.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I love that movie.
raj_koothrappali I’ve never seen it.
stuart_bloom Me neither.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s great. It’s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
stuart_bloom Don’t need to see it. Living it.
bernadette_rostenkowski But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.
penny Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?
leonard_hofstadter What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?
amy_farrah_fowler You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, I don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.
howard_wolowitz Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I’m in this room.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn’t know Bernadette. You wouldn’t be dating Penny.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up.
penny Oh, you weren’t joking.
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.
howard_wolowitz I’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen.
raj_koothrappali Maybe this time he’s going to do it.
howard_wolowitz Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes.
leonard_hofstadter Watch me.
penny Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?
leonard_hofstadter I, uh, ah, um, I…
penny A few minutes it is.
raj_koothrappali You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.
leonard_hofstadter You guys are making me nervous.
howard_wolowitz Fine, then go talk to her on your own.
leonard_hofstadter I will. Excuse me.
penny Yeah?
leonard_hofstadter Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?
penny Really? You don’t sound so sure.
leonard_hofstadter No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.
penny What’s that?
leonard_hofstadter Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?
penny I think you’re too late.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, I would not have peed my pants.
howard_wolowitz She nailed it.
raj_koothrappali Sounds about right.
leonard_hofstadter But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.
amy_farrah_fowler Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up.
howard_wolowitz Doesn’t matter. Bernadette still would’ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. You would’ve been all over me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well…
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Penny, can I take that table?
penny Sure, why?
bernadette_rostenkowski The one in the turtleneck is cute.
raj_koothrappali Open wide, here comes the happy train.
howard_wolowitz Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Never mind.
raj_koothrappali Oh, man, that is so us.
leonard_hofstadter You know, maybe you and I wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself.
penny Why?
leonard_hofstadter Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.
zack_johnson Hey, babe.
penny Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
zack_johnson Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.
penny Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hold on.
zack_johnson Aw, babe, I peed myself.
penny Me, too.
leonard_hofstadter The end.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things.
amy_farrah_fowler Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
sheldon_cooper Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.
mary_cooper Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.
sheldon_cooper Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them.
penny Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half.
raj_koothrappali My father’s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I’m gay.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him.
amy_farrah_fowler And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.
penny We do?
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny Doing laundry?
sheldon_cooper Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.
penny Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them.
penny Okay, that’s enough.
leonard_hofstadter Disagree.
raj_koothrappali Keep going.
howard_wolowitz More.
penny So, what do you think?
sheldon_cooper A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.
penny Please, Sheldon. I need you.
sheldon_cooper To what?
penny To take me.
sheldon_cooper I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
penny Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.
sheldon_cooper Penny, for the thousandth time, I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.
penny I think I know how to change your mind.
leonard_hofstadter That’s enough.
raj_koothrappali Ew.
stuart_bloom I was okay with it.
amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Actually, much better.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I just got back.
amy_farrah_fowler Where’d you go?
sheldon_cooper My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude.
amy_farrah_fowler Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.
penny Great.
raj_koothrappali At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?
leonard_hofstadter We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.
howard_wolowitz I lived with her to save money.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?
howard_wolowitz Not exactly.
penny What do you mean, not exactly?
howard_wolowitz Well, things would be a little different.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, where’s my lunch? I’m starving.
howard_wolowitz I know you’re starving. The neighbours know you’re starving. There’s starving people in Africa who know you’re starving.
debbie_wolowitz That’s it? There’s not enough food.
bernadette_rostenkowski How is this any different?
howard_wolowitz You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.
debbie_wolowitz You’re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.
amy_farrah_fowler Wait, did she die or did you kill her?
howard_wolowitz Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.
raj_koothrappali Come on, Leonard, dinner.
fat_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 Coming.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Why would I be fat?
raj_koothrappali You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.
leonard_hofstadter Why can’t you be fat, too?
fat_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 What do you want to do for dessert?
fat_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 I think there’s still half a cake from breakfast.
fat_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 No, there’s not.
fat_stuart#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 Hey, guys.
fat_leonard_and_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 Stuart!
raj_koothrappali What are you doing?
stuart_bloom I just wanted to be in anyone’s story.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, but why are you fat?
stuart_bloom ‘Cause Leonard was fat.
penny Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s hard to say, my life would be so different.
howard_wolowitz You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know.
amy_farrah_fowler Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me.
stuart_bloom I’ll stop now.
amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.
penny Aw.
amy_farrah_fowler Yay.
raj_koothrappali Congrats.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.
leonard_hofstadter Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there.
sheldon_cooper Oh no, no, I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.
howard_wolowitz Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
sheldon_cooper Why?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.
sheldon_cooper Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.
bernadette_rostenkowski You actually got him to do it.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him.
amy_farrah_fowler If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it.
leonard_hofstadter I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.
amy_farrah_fowler I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand.
leonard_hofstadter He made you his screensaver.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix.
amy_farrah_fowler I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.
penny Who’s that?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Madame Curie.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s fine, she’s dead.
sheldon_cooper You okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Just really glad you’re back.
sheldon_cooper Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.
amy_farrah_fowler I missed you.
sheldon_cooper To quote Han Solo, I know.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you miss me?
sheldon_cooper I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh.
sheldon_cooper Or instead of me.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you hold the baby?
sheldon_cooper I did.
amy_farrah_fowler And? How did it make you feel?
sheldon_cooper Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.
fat_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.
howard_wolowitz And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
fat_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 Put up or shut up. You make it, I’ll drink it.
penny You guys need anything else?
fat_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode11 Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.
penny I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?
stuart_bloom Not until I get my kiss.
