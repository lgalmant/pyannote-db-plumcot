leonard Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.
penny I’m the dumplings.
howard Yes, you are.
penny Creepy, Howard.
howard Creepy good or creepy bad?
leonard Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
howard That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. I’m not necessarily talking to the food.
penny Sit over there.
sheldon Sit over there. Baby wipe?
penny What do you have….
leonard_and_howard_together Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!
sheldon I’ll tell you why.
leonard_and_howard O-o-o-oh!
sheldon I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
penny I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
leonard_and_howard Why? Don’t!
sheldon Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
raj Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new… ew-ew-ew
penny Gosh, Raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? Okay, well, I’ll just, um, go eat by myself.
leonard Penny, you don’t have to do that.
penny No, it’s okay, between him not talking, him talking and… him, I’m better off alone, so, goodbye you poor strange little man
raj She’s so considerate.
howard So what’s your news?
raj Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
leonard Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
raj Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.
leonard_and_howard_together Well, wow, that’s incredible.
sheldon Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?
raj Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
sheldon If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
raj It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.
howard Oh, I’d so do her.
leonard You’d do the dolphins.
howard Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
raj Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
howard Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.
raj It’s a lease.
sheldon I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
raj Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
sheldon What people?
raj The people from People.
sheldon Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?
raj Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.
leonard Are you proud of yourself?
sheldon In general, yes.
sheldon Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?
leonard Hi Sheldon.
sheldon Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.
howard Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.
leonard Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
sheldon Apologise, for what?
leonard Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive.
sheldon I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
howard You were a colossal ass-hat.
sheldon Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.
leonard Really, do tell.
sheldon How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.
leonard Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
sheldon I had not considered that.
leonard Come on.
sheldon I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
howard He can feel sadness?
leonard Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension.
leonard And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him.
sheldon But I’m not.
howard Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that.
sheldon Fine, what do you want me to do?
leonard Smile.
howard Oh crap, that’s terrifying.
leonard We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.
howard Try less teeth.
leonard Close enough, come on. Hi Raj.
raj Hey guys, what’s up?
howard We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
leonard Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?
raj It’s very nice of you, I would like that.
gablehauser Hello boys.
raj Dr Gablehouser.
gablehauser Dr Koothrappali.
leonard Dr Gablehauser.
gablehauser Dr Hoffstadter.
sheldon Dr Gablehauser.
gablehauser Dr Cooper.
howard Dr Gablehauser.
gablehauser Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I’ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?
raj Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.
gablehauser I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.
sheldon Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.
leonard Sheldon!
sheldon Oh, sorry.
gablehauser Well, we’ve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.
raj Really, you don’t have to go to any trouble.
gablehauser How about if I put you in Von Gerlick’s old office?
raj I’d rather have Fishbine’s, it’s bigger.
gablehauser Done.
howard Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.
sheldon He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon Damn, this is hard.
gablehauser Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?
leonard Science?
gablehauser Money.
howard Told you.
gablehauser And this boy’s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well, taller than you
howard I have a master’s degree.
gablehauser Who doesn’t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President’s dining room?
raj I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
gablehauser It’s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.
raj Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys.
leonard You can stop smiling now.
sheldon Aaaah!
raj So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?
leonard No.
raj It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
sheldon Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.
raj Excuse me. Oh, it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.
howard They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
sheldon Have we at this point met our social obligations?
leonard Not yet.
raj Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him.
leonard You just got him this afternoon.
raj Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.
leonard A lackey?
raj Oh, I’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
sheldon Now?
leonard Almost.
raj Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.
howard Oh, gee, thanks.
raj Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.
sheldon There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point.
penny Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.
raj Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?
howard Gee, I’d love to Raj, but I can’t make it.
raj Oh, okay, Leonard?
leonard Well, uh, no I… the… no.
raj Sheldon?
sheldon I can make it, but I won’t.
penny What are you guys talking about?
raj Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.
penny And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?
sheldon A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
howard That would be cool. I’d go to that reception.
penny Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.
raj Would you like to go with me?
penny Of course I would, I would be honoured.
raj Really? Cool.
penny Shame on you guys.
raj Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
sheldon Now?
leonard Now.
raj Hey, buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine.
charlie_sheen Yeah, call me when you’re on the cover.
penny Oh, Raj, look at you!
raj I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?
penny Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?
raj It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready.
penny Oh, I’m ready.
raj That’s what you’re wearing.
penny Um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?
raj Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.
penny Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get.
raj Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.
penny Hey Leonard.
leonard Hey.
raj Dude.
leonard You look very nice.
raj_and_penny_together Thank you.
penny Uh, come on, good night Leonard.
leonard Good night.
raj Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.
leonard Yeah.
raj It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
leonard Terrific.
raj It has more food too.
penny Alright, come on, come on.
raj I’m coming up so you better get this party started.
leonard Hey.
howard Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.
leonard Anythingforagreencard.com?
howard I’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis.
leonard You’re joking.
howard Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning English.
leonard Pass.
howard So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
leonard It’s not a date, and that’s racist.
howard It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons.
leonard Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
sheldon Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Brown rice, not white?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
leonard Yes.
sheldon Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Thank you.
leonard You’re welcome.
sheldon What took you so long?
leonard Just sit down and eat.
sheldon Fine.
leonard Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?
sheldon I want you to check before you accept the order.
leonard Sorry.
sheldon Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
leonard He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
sheldon Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.
howard Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
sheldon That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
leonard Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
sheldon No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.
howard Lucky?
sheldon Yes, Lucky.
leonard He’s irony impaired, just move on.
howard Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.
sheldon While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.
howard So, not a puppy?
sheldon Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.
leonard A griffin?
sheldon Yes, half eagle, half lion.
leonard And mythological.
sheldon Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.
howard Sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point.
sheldon My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
leonard You want to breed a new friend?
sheldon That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.
howard Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane.
leonard That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people.
sheldon Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested.
leonard If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.
howard And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.
sheldon He should share our love of technology.
howard And he should know a lot of women.
leonard Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.
raj Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
penny Yes, it’s very nice, goodnight Raj.
raj No, wait, the evening’s not over.
penny Yes it is.
raj No, it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.
penny Oh, wow, is the evening over.
raj Wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.
penny Wait, meet them.
raj Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I’m not drunk.
mrs_koothrappali Why would you say that?
raj Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.
penny I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
dr_koothrappali I can’t see her, centre her in the frame.
raj Here you go, cute huh?
mrs_koothrappali She’s not Indian.
dr_koothrappali So, she’s not Indian, the boy’s just sowing some wild oats.
penny No, no, there’s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.
mrs_koothrappali What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.
raj What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
dr_koothrappali Look, Rajesh, I understand, you’re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don’t want it for a steady diet.
raj Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go throw up.
mrs_koothrappali What’s wrong with him?
penny I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste. And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
dr_koothrappali She’s feisty. I like that.
penny Raj, what are you doing. . No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.
raj Sorry.
penny Oh, sweetie, it’s okay.
