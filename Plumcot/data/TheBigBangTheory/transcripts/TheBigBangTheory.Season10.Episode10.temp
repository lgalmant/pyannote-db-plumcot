amy If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?
sheldon Oh, actually, I would.
amy Great, what’d you have in mind?
sheldon Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
amy Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.
sheldon You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.
amy Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.
sheldon You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.
amy Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody.
sheldon It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
amy It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
sheldon Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.
amy I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
sheldon Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting.
sheldon Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.
penny Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
sheldon What happened to them?
penny Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.
leonard Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool.
penny Amy wants me to have it.
amy Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.
penny But it’s a picture of you.
amy And you.
penny But you commissioned it.
amy To give to you.
penny But you like it so much.
amy So do you.
penny I seem to be losing.
leonard Yes, you do.
sheldon You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?
penny Why don’t you keep it?
sheldon That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.
penny Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.
sheldon Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?
leonard Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
sheldon Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.
leonard Fine, take the plant.
sheldon Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up.
bernadette Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift.
stuart Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.
bernadette A foot massage?
stuart And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you.
howard This is very nice Stuart, thank you.
bernadette How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
stuart Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?
bernadette Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby.
stuart Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get.
bernadette Thank you, but I’m not really sure.
howard Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.
stuart That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.
bernadette I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
stuart Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.
howard When would you move in?
stuart Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum.
bernadette Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
stuart Okay, then I’ll dust.
bernadette I did that, too.
stuart Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.
bernadette Howard just did that.
howard Yeah, let him do it.
sheldon Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
leonard Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.
mr_spock_cuckoo_clock Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.
sheldon It’s one of a kind.
penny So if it breaks there’d be none of it?
sheldon Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.
leonard So you think you should keep it?
sheldon I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.
leonard Keep the clock, Sheldon.
sheldon Thank you.
penny Thank you.
amy Thank you?
sheldon Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?
leonard Let me guess, you want it.
sheldon Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.
leonard You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care.
sheldon Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
leonard Well, now they’re yours.
penny Leonard.
leonard Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
sheldon For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?
amy Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?
sheldon It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.
leonard You know what? There is one thing I would like.
sheldon Yeah, take whatever you want.
leonard I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
sheldon But you don’t even like flags.
leonard Yeah, I like this one.
sheldon But I designed it.
leonard But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
sheldon But you don’t even understand its symbolism.
leonard Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.
sheldon Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted.
amy I don’t think you do, but all right.
bernadette Stuart, you cooked?
howard How did you know it wasn’t me?
bernadette There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess.
howard That’s Raj.
stuart You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm.
howard It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.
bernadette You have a Batsuit.
howard It’s pajamas, there’s no cape.
stuart Hey, Raj.
raj Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?
stuart Oh, I’m living here again.
raj Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
stuart No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.
raj Okay, cool.
stuart Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready.
raj Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
stuart Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.
leonard Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
penny Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.
leonard Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
penny Are you sure?
leonard Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.
penny What a jerk.
leonard You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?
penny Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.
leonard Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.
sheldon Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too.
sheldon If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.
leonard All right, I tried.
sheldon All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.
amy I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
sheldon It’s a good thing you’re cute.
raj So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.
bernadette Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that.
stuart Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house.
howard That’d be great.
stuart I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.
bernadette Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
stuart You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control.
raj Although it was already under control.
stuart I’m sorry, you mumbled something?
raj It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
stuart Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.
raj Well, they already had a village.
stuart I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together.
raj Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.
stuart You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you.
bernadette Do something, Batman.
leonard Hey.
sheldon What do you think you’re doing?
leonard Separating my delicates.
sheldon This is the level you’re stooping to.
leonard No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.
stuart Hey, what’s up?
raj I’m here to put the crib together.
stuart Ooh, sorry, I already did it.
raj Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.
stuart Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com
raj Why are you being like this?
stuart Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.
raj Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.
stuart Why can’t there be four wheels?
raj Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?
stuart Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.
raj Thank you.
stuart If you’re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.
penny I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?
leonard No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?
strange_old_man Hey, how you doing?
leonard Uh, can I help you?
strange_old_man I don’t think so, but you’re sweet for asking.
penny What, what are you doing in our apartment?
strange_old_man Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.
leonard Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here.
sheldon So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.
leonard Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?
sheldon My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
theodore It’s like the ’40s again.
sheldon Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.
penny All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.
sheldon That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID.
theodore Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative.
sheldon And now you know as much about him as I do.
raj Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?
bernadette Great, go with the giraffes.
stuart Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.
bernadette Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras.
stuart Good choice, boss.
raj At least my nose is naturally brown.
bernadette Hey, could you please go to the market for me?
howard Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
bernadette Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you.
howard Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them.
bernadette Please just go to the store.
howard Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
raj Me
stuart I’ll do it.
bernadette Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
penny What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
leonard And just leave him here alone?
penny Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive.
leonard Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?
theodore Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.
leonard This is ridiculous.
theodore I like the painting. Is that your mom?
leonard Sheldon, get out here.
sheldon Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?
leonard We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
sheldon I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
leonard Because you were being selfish.
sheldon Dividing our belongings is difficult.
leonard Why? I said I didn’t care.
theodore Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.
leonard Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.
theodore Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.
amy I think he might be right. Also, who is that?
sheldon I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.
leonard Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone.
theodore If you’re looking for a new guy to live with.
leonard No.
penny We’re good, thank you.
amy So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay.
sheldon Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
leonard Well, I’d like that, too.
sheldon In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
leonard You promise?
sheldon I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
theodore Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine.
penny Little lower to the left. A little more.
leonard Good?
penny No, still hideous.
leonard Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there.
penny Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.
theodore I think it brings the room together.
howard Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?
raj I’ll do it.
stuart Why do you get to do it? I’m the artist.
raj Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
stuart Just because I look sickly doesn’t mean I’m starving.
bernadette Howard!
howard Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.
bernadette I think I’m in labour.
howard Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.
stuart I’ll get the hospital bag.
raj I’ll pull the van up.
stuart Meet you outside in 2 minutes.
raj Team Baby, go.
howard I love you.
bernadette I love you, too.
stuart Are we hugging or having a baby? Let’s go.
