howard What’s so funny?
bernadette Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
howard I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t I?
bernadette It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
howard You know it’s meant as a compliment.
bernadette That’s how I take it.
howard This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
bernadette Me too.
howard Well, gotta go.
bernadette Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?
howard Well, I’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.
bernadette Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.
howard It’s not just the wig. It’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It’s a two-person job.
bernadette It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.
howard Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?
bernadette Stay.
howard Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?
bernadette Go home.
howard Your call.
bernadette Howard, have you ever considered us living together?
howard Boy, I don’t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?
bernadette No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.
howard I’ve got a better solution.
bernadette What?
howard We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.
bernadette Great.
howard Look at us planning a future together.
mrs_wolowitz Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
howard Sex criminals don’t have keys, Ma.
mrs_wolowitz Where were you so late?
howard I was out with Bernadette.
mrs_wolowitz I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!
howard I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!
mrs_wolowitz God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!
howard Nobody has a disease!
mrs_wolowitz I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?
howard That’s it. I don’t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
mrs_wolowitz Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
howard I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
leonard Hey, what’s up?
howard I need a place to crash.
leonard Uh, sure. Why?
howard Big fight with my mother.
leonard Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
howard No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.
sheldon What’s going on?
leonard Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
sheldon Did you offer him a hot beverage?
leonard No.
sheldon Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.
howard Tea does sound nice.
sheldon You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?
howard There’s no room. His sister is staying with him.
leonard Wait, wait. What?
sheldon Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here.
leonard Priya’s in town?
howard Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…
leonard Hold on. When did Priya get here?
howard I don’t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn’t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust Bernadette.
leonard Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye.
sheldon Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.
howard That’s not really necessary.
sheldon No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you.
howard Thanks.
sheldon That’s what tertiary friends are for.
raj Who is it?
leonard It’s Leonard.
raj You can’t come in.
leonard I just want to talk to her.
raj I forbid it.
priya Open the door, Rajesh.
raj You heard me. I forbidded it.
priya Forbidded it?
raj Forbaded it?
priya Get out of the way. What are you doing here?
leonard What are you doing here?
priya I have business in Los Angeles.
leonard Why didn’t you call?
raj Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.
priya I’m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn’t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.
leonard I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
raj No!
priya Sure.
raj It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation! Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
sheldon Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
howard That’s very nice of you, but I made other plans.
sheldon Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.
priya Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.
howard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
raj Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
priya Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.
raj Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.
leonard The word is forbade.
raj Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
priya Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t have a relationship with.
sheldon Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
raj There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.
priya I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.
raj Some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. My point is, you can’t go out with Leonard.
penny Who can’t go out with Leonard?
raj My sister.
leonard Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya.
priya It’s very nice to meet you.
penny Oh, yeah, you, too.
sheldon Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.
penny Sheldon!
leonard Really?
howard Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?
bernadette Sure.
raj Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
howard Listen, my mom’s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That’s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.
bernadette That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?
howard Isn’t that great?
bernadette No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.
howard Oh, uh…
bernadette Wrong answer.
howard No, wait. You didn’t let me finish.
bernadette I’m listening.
howard Uh…
bernadette Agh!
amy I came as quickly as I could.
penny Okay. Why?
amy To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.
penny Amy, I’m fine.
amy You don’t have to be strong for me. Now let’s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.
penny What?
amy In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.
penny Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.
amy Oh. Then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
penny Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?
amy Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.
penny Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?
amy This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?
howard I choose you.
bernadette Really?
howard Yep. I moved out of my mother’s house. Cord is cut. I’m all yours.
bernadette What did she say when you told her?
howard I don’t know. She hasn’t responded to my email yet.
bernadette This is so great. I love you, Howard.
howard I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?
bernadette Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house.
howard That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
leonard I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.
priya I’d love that.
leonard I love the way you say, I’d love that.
raj She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
priya Rajesh, don’t be a child.
raj I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.
leonard My sister’s 38 and married.
raj All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
penny Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.
sheldon That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports.
priya Hi. Penny, right?
penny Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose.
sheldon No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.
penny If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn’t have to take that.
amy Hi, bestie.
penny Hi. So, um, Priya, you’re a lawyer, right?
priya I know. Pretty boring, huh?
leonard Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?
priya Thank you, Leonard. That doesn’t make it sound boring at all.
amy So, how you holding up?
penny I’m fine.
amy Oh, who are you kidding? She’s breathtaking.
priya So, Penny, Leonard tells me you’re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.
penny Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
sheldon Did you get the part?
penny I didn’t do the audition.
sheldon Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?
priya I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.
leonard Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
priya In his tongue.
leonard Whose tongue?
priya Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.
leonard What, with my tongue in your tail?
amy I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
bernadette Wow.
howard Wow, indeed.
bernadette I can’t believe we’re finally living together.
howard Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
bernadette What?
howard A little snack. You got any string cheese?
bernadette No. I, I might have some cheddar.
howard Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
bernadette Okay.
howard You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
bernadette No.
howard Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.
bernadette Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?
howard Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist.
bernadette I have to take you?
howard You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.
bernadette Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
howard It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.
bernadette I can’t believe this.
howard What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.
bernadette All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother.
howard Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?
mrs_wolowitz Who’s that? Is it a sex criminal?
howard Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.
mrs_wolowitz Where were you?
howard Didn’t you read my email?
mrs_wolowitz You know I can’t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.
howard Thank you.
mrs_wolowitz Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!
penny Oh, hey. What’s up?
amy I just wanted to check in on you.
penny Why?
amy It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.
penny I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased that Leonard has found someone that makes him so happy.
amy It’s okay, it’s okay.
penny Thank you.
amy Now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.
penny Okay.
penny I smell Chinese food.
sheldon It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
penny Are Leonard and Priya here?
sheldon They went to Catalina for the weekend.
penny Oh. Where’s Raj?
sheldon At home, forbidding it.
penny How about Howard?
sheldon I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
penny Oh, okay. Well, I guess it’s just the two of us, huh?
sheldon Actually, it’s the three of us.
amy What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.
penny Great.
amy So, you feeling better?
penny Not really.
amy Sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset.
sheldon Right. I’ll make tea.
penny Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. I don’t want tea.
sheldon I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
