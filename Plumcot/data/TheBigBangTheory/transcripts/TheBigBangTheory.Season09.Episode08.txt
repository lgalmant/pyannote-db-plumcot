penny I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.
penny Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
leonard_hofstadter Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.
penny Oh, I don’t want credit for that.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.
leonard_hofstadter You’re in a good mood.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
penny Oh. Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter What brought this on?
sheldon_cooper I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.
penny And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
sheldon_cooper No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I made French toast sticks.
sheldon_cooper On oatmeal day?
leonard_hofstadter Ah, I also made oatmeal.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like.
penny Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
howard_wolowitz No problem.
raj_koothrappali So what’s up?
sheldon_cooper Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.
howard_wolowitz You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
raj_koothrappali You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
howard_wolowitz Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.
raj_koothrappali Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen.
raj_koothrappali Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.
howard_wolowitz But what are you looking for?
sheldon_cooper All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.
howard_wolowitz Isn’t that a little unreasonable?
sheldon_cooper All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.
penny Come on, Amy, show us the dress.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
penny Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.
penny No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.
penny Ooh.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.
penny Yeah, come on, tell us more.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?
bernadette_rostenkowski Did you kiss him yet?
amy_farrah_fowler Just a little peck on the lips.
penny Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.
amy_farrah_fowler Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one.
penny All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Tea and basketball?
amy_farrah_fowler To that new Italian place on Walnut.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, nice.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m gonna go look for other shoes.
penny Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?
penny We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation.
penny Damn, you’re sneaky.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.
howard_wolowitz I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
raj_koothrappali And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.
howard_wolowitz If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?
sheldon_cooper Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.
howard_wolowitz You seriously think women would fight for you?
sheldon_cooper People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?
howard_wolowitz He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.
howard_wolowitz Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist.
sheldon_cooper And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
howard_wolowitz I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.
sheldon_cooper Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.
raj_koothrappali Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
howard_wolowitz Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.
raj_koothrappali I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
howard_wolowitz Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
penny Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
leonard_hofstadter What? I don’t want to do that.
penny What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
leonard_hofstadter This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
penny No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.
leonard_hofstadter So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
penny You’re not curious who she’s out with?
leonard_hofstadter Not really.
penny But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.
sheldon_cooper That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
howard_wolowitz Congratulations.
raj_koothrappali This is exciting.
sheldon_cooper Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.
howard_wolowitz Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
sheldon_cooper And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.
raj_koothrappali I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
howard_wolowitz Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.
sheldon_cooper Golly, she sounds too good to be true.
tall_british_dave#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?
dave_gibbs Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.
dave_gibbs No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.
penny Hey. So, where are they?
bernadette_rostenkowski Across the street, in the left window.
penny Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.
bernadette_rostenkowski Right here.
leonard_hofstadter You just happen to have those in the car?
bernadette_rostenkowski Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.
leonard_hofstadter By stalking them?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
penny Oh, there he is.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s cute, right?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Can I see?
penny What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.
leonard_hofstadter I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.
penny Fine.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone.
penny Your what?
bernadette_rostenkowski Nothing. Not important.
dave_gibbs So you’ve never been married?
amy_farrah_fowler No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship.
dave_gibbs Oh. What happened with that?
amy_farrah_fowler That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.
dave_gibbs Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?
amy_farrah_fowler No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
dave_gibbs I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?
amy_farrah_fowler Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.
dave_gibbs Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m trying not to. Do you know him?
dave_gibbs No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?
penny He really seems into her.
bernadette_rostenkowski I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
bernadette_rostenkowski Why’d you bring him?
penny I had to; we’re married now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ugh, I hear that.
dave_gibbs I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler Sure, why not?
dave_gibbs It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?
amy_farrah_fowler Um about an hour and half.
dave_gibbs Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.
dave_gibbs Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius, and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.
amy_farrah_fowler What was the rest of your question?
dave_gibbs Do you think you could introduce me to him?
amy_farrah_fowler Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
dave_gibbs You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to do.
leonard_hofstadter Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
bernadette_rostenkowski Right here.
raj_koothrappali 37 minutes left until the deadline.
sheldon_cooper Someone will show.
howard_wolowitz And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.
raj_koothrappali Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
sheldon_cooper Someone will show.
raj_koothrappali Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.
sheldon_cooper Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.
dave_gibbs You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.
amy_farrah_fowler I have a DVD of that lecture.
dave_gibbs Really? Wasn’t it great?
amy_farrah_fowler Not as a Valentine’s present, no.
dave_gibbs Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?
dave_gibbs Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.
amy_farrah_fowler No, you’re not.
dave_gibbs Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
dave_gibbs That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on Thursday.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, hey, they’re leaving.
penny What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us.
bernadette_rostenkowski We got to get out of here.
penny Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?
bernadette_rostenkowski He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
penny Oh, no.
dave_gibbs She just hit my car.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you guys doing here?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter What happened?
dave_gibbs O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
dave_gibbs I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
amy_farrah_fowler No. Pinch me.
dave_gibbs It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.
dave_gibbs Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.
leonard_hofstadter You really should.
raj_koothrappali Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
sheldon_cooper One minute is a long time.
howard_wolowitz I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.
raj_koothrappali Forty-five.
sheldon_cooper 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.
raj_koothrappali Thirty seconds.
sheldon_cooper Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.
howard_wolowitz You thought she was great in X-Men.
sheldon_cooper Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
raj_koothrappali Guys, fifteen seconds.
howard_wolowitz Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
sheldon_cooper Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.
raj_koothrappali Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad.
howard_wolowitz Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
raj_koothrappali I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because… we are the dreamers of dreams.
howard_wolowitz It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty.
raj_koothrappali Answer it.
sheldon_cooper All right. Can I help you?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.
sheldon_cooper Careful, it’s addictive.
vanessa#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.
sheldon_cooper And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
vanessa#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
sheldon_cooper I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.
raj_koothrappali How could you send her away?
sheldon_cooper She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.
dave_gibbs Uh, thanks for driving me home.
amy_farrah_fowler No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.
dave_gibbs Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again.
amy_farrah_fowler Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out.
dave_gibbs Oh. Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m, I’m really sorry.
dave_gibbs No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.
amy_farrah_fowler There you go.
dave_gibbs If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common.
amy_farrah_fowler Sure. Heh.
dave_gibbs And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think about it…
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, get out.
