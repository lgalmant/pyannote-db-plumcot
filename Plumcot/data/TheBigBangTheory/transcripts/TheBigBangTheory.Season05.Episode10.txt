howard_wolowitz It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
leonard_hofstadter It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.
sheldon_cooper Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.
sheldon_cooper Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool.
stuart_bloom Can I help you find anything?
amy_farrah_fowler A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.
stuart_bloom Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.
raj_koothrappali Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.
howard_wolowitz A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid.
raj_koothrappali They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?
howard_wolowitz Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
raj_koothrappali A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
leonard_hofstadter Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?
howard_wolowitz What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?
stuart_bloom Leonard, what’s the deal with Sheldon’s friend Amy? Are they a couple?
leonard_hofstadter Couple of weirdos. Why?
howard_wolowitz You interested in Amy?
stuart_bloom Well, I mean, she didn’t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. I guess.
raj_koothrappali Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
stuart_bloom If I tell you that, I’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin’ tootin’ low price of $24.95.
raj_koothrappali I’ll take one.
howard_wolowitz Mmm, make it two.
leonard_hofstadter I hate all of you and myself. Three.
stuart_bloom I’ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward.
sheldon_cooper I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?
leonard_hofstadter No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
sheldon_cooper I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
sheldon_cooper The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.
leonard_hofstadter All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it.
sheldon_cooper Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.
leonard_hofstadter I am not washed-up.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem.
penny Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.
amy_farrah_fowler I had half a glass.
bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t have any.
penny Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?
amy_farrah_fowler Or we play Travel Twister.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, really? Twister?
amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.
penny Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.
amy_farrah_fowler Guys, something happened.
penny What’s wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler I think a boy likes me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
penny Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?
penny Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot.
penny Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie.
penny Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.
sheldon_cooper Where’s Stuart?
speccy_guy_behind_counter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 Out.
sheldon_cooper Who are you?
speccy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 I’m Dale. He left me in charge.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
dale Yeah. I don’t get it, either.
leonard_hofstadter I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.
dale Sorry. I don’t do returns. They’re hard.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?
dale I don’t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I guess I was wrong.
leonard_hofstadter You okay?
sheldon_cooper Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?
dale I’m okay, too!
raj_koothrappali Wild Bill Witchcock.
leonard_hofstadter A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
sheldon_cooper Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. Patooie.
howard_wolowitz We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Very.
raj_koothrappali Incredibly so.
sheldon_cooper Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Very.
raj_koothrappali Incredibly so.
sheldon_cooper All right, fine. Let’s just play.
leonard_hofstadter We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.
howard_wolowitz Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?
sheldon_cooper Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
howard_wolowitz Sorry. Creepy Tepee.
raj_koothrappali Annie Ogly.
leonard_hofstadter Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
sheldon_cooper And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here.
leonard_hofstadter It’s you.
howard_wolowitz You are.
raj_koothrappali Totally you.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin.
leonard_hofstadter Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, a sheriff’s badge.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s also a wand.
leonard_hofstadter With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?
sheldon_cooper I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.
leonard_hofstadter You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
howard_wolowitz I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.
sheldon_cooper Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
raj_koothrappali Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
sheldon_cooper Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?
raj_koothrappali You’re so full of it.
sheldon_cooper You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
raj_koothrappali You unfriended me? Seriously?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?
sheldon_cooper And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
howard_wolowitz Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.
sheldon_cooper And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?
sheldon_cooper Why?
leonard_hofstadter I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
penny Who do we love?
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Who do we love?
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Who do we love?
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny What’s up?
sheldon_cooper I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
penny I’m sorry, what?
sheldon_cooper A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight.
penny God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?
sheldon_cooper No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
penny Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
sheldon_cooper I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?
penny All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?
sheldon_cooper I believe I do.
penny Mm.
sheldon_cooper I’m the guy.
penny You’re not the guy.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.
penny I call everyone sweetie.
sheldon_cooper You tramp.
penny Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
sheldon_cooper Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?
penny Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.
stuart_bloom If you’re bored, you can go. I understand.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I’m having a nice time.
stuart_bloom Don’t patronize me.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Pardon me. Excuse me.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.
stuart_bloom None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.
stuart_bloom Um, again…
sheldon_cooper Stuart, please. You’re being rude.
amy_farrah_fowler Anything else?
sheldon_cooper I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m listening.
sheldon_cooper With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
sheldon_cooper You’re being impossible.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Stuart.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.
stuart_bloom So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.
stuart_bloom Oh, you’re welcome.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy. Let’s wrap things up out there.
amy_farrah_fowler Um, good night, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Good night.
sheldon_cooper Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.
amy_farrah_fowler How did you get into my apartment?
sheldon_cooper Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s that?
sheldon_cooper I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s so romantic.
sheldon_cooper Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
sheldon_cooper Feel free to retain a lawyer.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny, I said right hand red.
penny Yeah, I heard you. I got red.
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette, left foot yellow.
bernadette_rostenkowski We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Amy. Bernadette.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!
sheldon_cooper I got a splinter.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you want me to do about it?
sheldon_cooper Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.
amy_farrah_fowler I should’ve gotten a lawyer.
bernadette_rostenkowski Looks like it’s just us playing. Penny? Penny, we’re out of wine!
penny You should probably drive.
