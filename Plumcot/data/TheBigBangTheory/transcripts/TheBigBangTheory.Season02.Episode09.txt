sheldon_cooper Penny, hello.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What is shaking?
penny I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
penny What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
sheldon_cooper I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
penny Please don’t do that.
sheldon_cooper All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
penny So, this wasn’t the awkward part?
sheldon_cooper No.
penny Oh, all right. S’u’up?
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?
penny Okay, feeling the awkward now.
sheldon_cooper Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
penny Yeah, Leonard told me.
sheldon_cooper Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
penny To you?
sheldon_cooper Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.
penny Well, what about me?
sheldon_cooper The statement stands for itself.
penny Well, aren’t you sweet?
sheldon_cooper Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.
penny Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.
sheldon_cooper You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.
penny Really?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
penny I could think about you.
sheldon_cooper Fine, whatever works.
penny Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Uh, peace out!
sheldon_cooper Well, this is very pleasant.
leonard_hofstadter I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
sheldon_cooper And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
leonard_hofstadter I stand corrected.
sheldon_cooper You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.
dr_stephanie_barnett That’s very interesting.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
sheldon_cooper Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
dr_stephanie_barnett No.
sheldon_cooper Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
dr_stephanie_barnett Ih-uh, strawberries.
sheldon_cooper Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?
dr_stephanie_barnett Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.
sheldon_cooper Really? That’s where I was born!
dr_stephanie_barnett You’re kidding!
sheldon_cooper I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.
dr_stephanie_barnett Why, what-what-what happened?
sheldon_cooper Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
dr_stephanie_barnett I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?
sheldon_cooper No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? Look at that, there’s even pasta left over.
leonard_hofstadter Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
sheldon_cooper I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?
sheldon_cooper To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
leonard_hofstadter What landing party?
sheldon_cooper You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy.
dr_stephanie_barnett So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest cavity, one of my earrings.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my god, what did you do?
dr_stephanie_barnett What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
sheldon_cooper I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
leonard_hofstadter Oo-oo-oh!
dr_stephanie_barnett Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.
leonard_hofstadter What invitation?
sheldon_cooper We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, clearly I could have.
sheldon_cooper It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.
dr_stephanie_barnett No, no, we have seats.
leonard_hofstadter Not the right seats.
dr_stephanie_barnett What is he doing?
leonard_hofstadter He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
dr_stephanie_barnett Does he always do this?
leonard_hofstadter Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
dr_stephanie_barnett No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet.
sheldon_cooper My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?
leonard_hofstadter No, just sit here.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah, this is it.
sheldon_cooper Leonard Leonard Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Tell me what you see here.
leonard_hofstadter The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
sheldon_cooper This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?
leonard_hofstadter Stephanie Barnett is single.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
leonard_hofstadter It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
sheldon_cooper You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
sheldon_cooper I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.
leonard_hofstadter General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
sheldon_cooper Give me one good reason why not.
leonard_hofstadter Because this is not Star Trek
sheldon_cooper Penny Penny Penny.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper This is banana bread.
penny This is a door knob.
sheldon_cooper It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
penny Sheldon, would you like to come in?
sheldon_cooper I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper How can you be sure?
penny Sheldon, what do you want?
sheldon_cooper I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.
penny He’s having problems with Stephanie?
sheldon_cooper She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.
penny We never got to the bedroom.
sheldon_cooper Because?
penny Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
sheldon_cooper It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.
raj_koothrappali You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
howard_wolowitz I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
sheldon_cooper More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I don’t think you can.
sheldon_cooper Well, why not?
howard_wolowitz Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
raj_koothrappali During which she defected to North Korea.
howard_wolowitz Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
raj_koothrappali For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
howard_wolowitz And a three hour dinner with Penny.
raj_koothrappali Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
howard_wolowitz Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
raj_koothrappali Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
howard_wolowitz I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on.
sheldon_cooper So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Penny Penny.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Penny. Zucchini bread.
penny Oh, thank you.
sheldon_cooper May I come in?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
penny Well, thank you.
sheldon_cooper So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.
leonard_hofstadter All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?
dr_stephanie_barnett Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hi Stephanie.
dr_stephanie_barnett Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Want some more wine?
dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight. .
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
sheldon_cooper I’m helping you with Stephanie.
leonard_hofstadter By making constipated moose sounds?
sheldon_cooper When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
leonard_hofstadter Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
sheldon_cooper Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, for god’s sakes.
sheldon_cooper Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened.
dr_stephanie_barnett Do you want some help with that?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, I got it.
sheldon_cooper No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it.
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh my god, are you okay?
leonard_hofstadter No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.
sheldon_cooper Like a gladiator!
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches.
leonard_hofstadter Stitches? With a needle?
dr_stephanie_barnett Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.
sheldon_cooper FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.
sheldon_cooper What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
sheldon_cooper Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
leonard_hofstadter I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
sheldon_cooper Watery?
leonard_hofstadter She stuck a needle into my hand!
dr_stephanie_barnett Hey, how’s my big cry baby?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t cry.
dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, are you still going to spend the night?
dr_stephanie_barnett Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.
sheldon_cooper She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.
dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, can you open this for me?
raj_koothrappali Can I see your stitches?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. .
raj_koothrappali Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
penny Leonard, congratulations.
leonard_hofstadter What for?
penny Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
leonard_hofstadter What? no. no, that’s not right.
howard_wolowitz Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
penny Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status.
penny Well, then who did?
sheldon_cooper I had no choice, he cried in front of her.
leonard_hofstadter You hacked my facebook account?
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.
leonard_hofstadter Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
sheldon_cooper In which I am not an expert.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
penny What’s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.
howard_wolowitz Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
leonard_hofstadter Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
