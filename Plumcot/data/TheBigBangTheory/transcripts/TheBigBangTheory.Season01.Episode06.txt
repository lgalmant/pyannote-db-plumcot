raj_koothrappali Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.
howard_wolowitz That was absolutely humiliating.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
howard_wolowitz Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party.
leonard_hofstadter I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.
sheldon_cooper You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let it go.
sheldon_cooper No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.
howard_wolowitz I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.
sheldon_cooper I was giving clear, concise orders.
leonard_hofstadter You hid behind a tree yelling 'get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.'
penny Oh, hey guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hello Penny.
howard_wolowitz Morning ma'am.
penny So, how was paintball, did you have fun?
sheldon_cooper Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.
penny Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.
leonard_hofstadter A party?
penny Yeah.
howard_wolowitz A boy-girl party?
penny Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing ...
sheldon_cooper Dancing?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I don't know, Penny ...
sheldon_cooper The thing is, we're not ...
leonard_hofstadter We're really more ...
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
penny Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.
sheldon_cooper A Halloween party?
howard_wolowitz As in, costumes?
penny Well, yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Is there a theme?
penny Um, yeah, Halloween.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?
penny As usual, I'm not following.
leonard_hofstadter He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy ...
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper What about comic-books?
penny Fine.
sheldon_cooper Anime?
penny Of course.
sheldon_cooper TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods ...
penny Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.
howard_wolowitz Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
leonard_hofstadter I'll get it.
howard_wolowitz Bjow
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no.
sheldon_cooper Oh no!
raj_koothrappali Make way for the fastest man alive. Oh no!
sheldon_cooper See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.
leonard_hofstadter We all have other costumes, we can change.
raj_koothrappali Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.
howard_wolowitz No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?
all@ Agreed.
leonard_hofstadter I call Frodo!
all@ Damn!
raj_koothrappali Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.
leonard_hofstadter You went with Thor?
raj_koothrappali What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.
howard_wolowitz I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
raj_koothrappali Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
sheldon_cooper I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
leonard_hofstadter No, it's not ...
sheldon_cooper If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!
leonard_hofstadter Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
sheldon_cooper Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
leonard_hofstadter For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.
sheldon_cooper Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.
leonard_hofstadter All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and ... perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork.
howard_wolowitz Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.
penny Oh, hey guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, sorry we're late.
penny Late? It's 7.
sheldon_cooper And you said the party starts at seven.
penny Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.
sheldon_cooper It's 7.
penny Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.
howard_wolowitz What, are all the girls in the bathroom?
penny Probably, but in their own homes.
sheldon_cooper So what time does the costume parade start?
penny The parade?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.
penny Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.
sheldon_cooper This party is just going to suck.
penny No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, Penny, he's Rob ...
howard_wolowitz I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.
penny No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.
sheldon_cooper Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
penny Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper See, people get it.
raj_koothrappali Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.
howard_wolowitz No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.
sheldon_cooper I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?
leonard_hofstadter We're socialising. Meeting new people.
sheldon_cooper Telepathically?
penny Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!
raj_koothrappali Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.
leonard_hofstadter She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.
sheldon_cooper And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
howard_wolowitz Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.
raj_koothrappali What is your move?
howard_wolowitz I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.
leonard_hofstadter Where do you get this stuff?
howard_wolowitz You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.
raj_koothrappali Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.
howard_wolowitz If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.
nurse_costume_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 No thanks.
howard_wolowitz No, seriously, you can, I have transient arrhythmia.
leonard_hofstadter I to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.
sheldon_cooper Well, I actually might be able to help.
leonard_hofstadter How so?
sheldon_cooper Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.
leonard_hofstadter Go on.
sheldon_cooper Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting 'How wasted am I?' which is met with an approving chorus of 'Dude.'
leonard_hofstadter Then what happens?
sheldon_cooper That's as far as I've gotten.
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.
sheldon_cooper Good luck.
leonard_hofstadter No, you're coming with me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I hardly think so.
leonard_hofstadter Come on.
sheldon_cooper Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. But I need a wing-man.
sheldon_cooper Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analyzing wreckage.
girl_in_hippie_costume#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Oh, Hi!
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 So, what are you supposed to be?
sheldon_cooper Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Uh, a choo-choo train?
sheldon_cooper Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 A brain damaged choo-choo train?
butterfly_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 How wasted am I?
sheldon_cooper Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 I still don't get it.
sheldon_cooper I'm the Doppler Effect.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.
leonard_hofstadter Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
sheldon_cooper Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.
leonard_hofstadter Because I'm Frodo.
sheldon_cooper Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.
leonard_hofstadter Oh no.
sheldon_cooper What?
leonard_hofstadter That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
sheldon_cooper What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
leonard_hofstadter If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.
sheldon_cooper Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.
leonard_hofstadter Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. .
sheldon_cooper You have a back-up hypothesis.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe they just want to be friends.
sheldon_cooper Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.
leonard_hofstadter Then he and I are on equal ground.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.
leonard_hofstadter Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
sheldon_cooper And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.
sheldon_cooper True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
leonard_hofstadter No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.
sheldon_cooper Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?
leonard_hofstadter Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
penny Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?
sheldon_cooper Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.
kurt What, you're a zebra, right?
sheldon_cooper Yet another child left behind.
kurt And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?
leonard_hofstadter No, I'm a Hobbit.
kurt What's the difference?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.
kurt So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
sheldon_cooper Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.
kurt Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.
leonard_hofstadter I think we're all talking to Penny here.
sheldon_cooper I'm not. No offence.
kurt Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.
penny Alright Kurt, be nice.
kurt Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.
penny Kurt!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.
kurt Are you calling me a puffy animal?
penny Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
sheldon_cooper If he understands that, you're in trouble.
kurt So what, I'm unevolved?
sheldon_cooper You're in trouble.
kurt You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.
penny Okay, Kurt, please.
leonard_hofstadter No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
kurt Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.
leonard_hofstadter A homo-habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
kurt What?
leonard_hofstadter I think I've made my point.
kurt Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.
sheldon_cooper Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.
leonard_hofstadter There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
kurt C - O - N ... frontation!
penny Kurt, put him down this instant.
kurt He started it.
penny I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.
kurt Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.
sheldon_cooper He's a Hobbit! I've got your back.
penny Leonard, are you okay.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so ...
penny Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.
sheldon_cooper Happy Halloween. If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.
leonard_hofstadter What's that?
sheldon_cooper Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Good. There there was really all I had.
leonard_hofstadter Good night Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Good night Leonard.
penny Hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hi Penny.
penny Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
leonard_hofstadter I'm fine.
penny I'm so sorry about what happened.
leonard_hofstadter It's not your fault.
penny Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.
leonard_hofstadter So why was he at your party?
penny Well, I ran into him last week and, he was ... just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and ... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to ...
leonard_hofstadter There there.
penny God, what is wrong with me.
leonard_hofstadter Nothing, you're perfect.
penny Gah, I'm not perfect.
leonard_hofstadter Yes you are.
penny You really think so, don't you?
leonard_hofstadter Penny?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter How much have you had to drink tonight?
penny Just ... a lot.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?
penny It might. Boy, you're really smart.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.
penny Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?
leonard_hofstadter Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.
penny I should probably go.
leonard_hofstadter Probably.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire.
sheldon_cooper Coming.
howard_wolowitz Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?
sheldon_cooper He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
howard_wolowitz He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for the clarification.
howard_wolowitz I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
sheldon_cooper Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.
butterfly_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!
