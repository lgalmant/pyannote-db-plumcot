howard_wolowitz Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?
leonard_hofstadter Yes
howard_wolowitz Were you in the original trilogy?
leonard_hofstadter Yes
howard_wolowitz Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
leonard_hofstadter God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?
leonard_hofstadter Yes
raj_koothrappali Interesting. Are you a Droid?
leonard_hofstadter Yes
raj_koothrappali Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
leonard_hofstadter Yes
raj_koothrappali C3PO.
leonard_hofstadter You got it.
sheldon_cooper That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it.
howard_wolowitz Leslie Winkle. You’ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.
sheldon_cooper What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?
leonard_hofstadter No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, back to the game.
sheldon_cooper I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready.
raj_koothrappali Are you Spock?
sheldon_cooper I don’t like this game.
howard_wolowitz So, where were we?
raj_koothrappali Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
howard_wolowitz No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who’s turn is it?
leonard_hofstadter We were up to you.
howard_wolowitz Great, just start.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?
howard_wolowitz She dumped me!
sheldon_cooper I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess.
raj_koothrappali What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having what appears be an emotional response?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.
howard_wolowitz Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God’s sake!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?
howard_wolowitz I don’t want to go anywhere.
sheldon_cooper You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems.Where you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.
raj_koothrappali Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!
leonard_hofstadter I’ve never been there, have you?
raj_koothrappali Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
howard_wolowitz It could be fun. I know my weekend’s wide open, now that…
leonard_hofstadter Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.
howard_wolowitz Now? Right now?
leonard_hofstadter Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now.
raj_koothrappali What do you say, Howard?
howard_wolowitz I say Vegas baby!
raj_koothrappali What are you going to tell your mother?
howard_wolowitz Sea World, baby!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?
sheldon_cooper I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
leonard_hofstadter Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Hello, neighbour.
penny Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper And how are you doing this fine evening?
penny Great.
sheldon_cooper Good. I’m glad.
penny Really? Are you drunk?
sheldon_cooper I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.
penny That’s Superman’s big ice thing, right?
sheldon_cooper Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
penny Mmm, what smells so good?
sheldon_cooper That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.
penny Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.
sheldon_cooper Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.
penny Have fun, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I shall. No!
penny What’s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?
raj_koothrappali Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, could I borrow some after shave?
howard_wolowitz Black case, top compartment.
leonard_hofstadter That is a lot of cologne.
howard_wolowitz First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.
raj_koothrappali That’s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, let’s go.
howard_wolowitz You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page.
howard_wolowitz Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.
raj_koothrappali But she did dump you.
howard_wolowitz Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you.
leonard_hofstadter Alright.
raj_koothrappali Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on the moon.
raj_koothrappali Sounds like a plan.
penny Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.
sheldon_cooper We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
penny So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.
sheldon_cooper I left them in the bowl.
penny Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
sheldon_cooper Where?
penny In your apartment.
sheldon_cooper What’s it doing in my apartment?
penny Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and I forgot it there.
sheldon_cooper You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
penny It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.
sheldon_cooper You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
penny Alright, Sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting.
sheldon_cooper Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
penny Yeah, why not?
sheldon_cooper Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
raj_koothrappali I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.
leonard_hofstadter Dude, check it out. That’s laundry for a month!
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode21 Hi.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode21 What’s your name?
raj_koothrappali Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode21 Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I’m Michaela.
raj_koothrappali Hello, Michaela.
mikayla So, are you interested a little party?
raj_koothrappali Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren’t Ramayan.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.
raj_koothrappali Not now, Leonard, Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I really need to talk to you.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are. What’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute.
raj_koothrappali What? No. ..
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.
raj_koothrappali Maybe I can save her.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.
raj_koothrappali It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.
mikayla Whatever.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I miss her already.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”
raj_koothrappali Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
leonard_hofstadter You think that’d help?
raj_koothrappali USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy.
raj_koothrappali It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
raj_koothrappali “I’m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
leonard_hofstadter Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
sheldon_cooper So, how was your day?
penny Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?
penny Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat.
raj_koothrappali Hello again.
mikayla Oh, hi.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…
raj_koothrappali If you’re really a prostitute.
mikayla You guys cops?
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode21 No.
mikayla I am a prostitute.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.
raj_koothrappali With sex.
leonard_hofstadter I think she knows what I meant.
raj_koothrappali How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
mikayla Don’t worry, I can take good care of your friend.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…
raj_koothrappali Prostitute.
mikayla You want the girlfriend experience.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.
raj_koothrappali Uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.
sheldon_cooper Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess.
penny Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
sheldon_cooper How can one person be a whole movie?
penny Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?
sheldon_cooper Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
penny Where did that even come from, did he say we were?
sheldon_cooper No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.
penny No, just mail, no benefits.
sheldon_cooper Hmm, I see.
penny Why are you asking?
sheldon_cooper I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.
penny Well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship.
sheldon_cooper Can you?
penny Excuse me?
sheldon_cooper Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
penny Sheldon, I really don’t want to talk about this with you.
sheldon_cooper Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
penny Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?
sheldon_cooper I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…
penny I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper Thank you, that’s very helpful.
howard_wolowitz Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?
leonard_hofstadter Behold?
howard_wolowitz Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?
raj_koothrappali A little baby.
howard_wolowitz I’m going back to the room.
mikayla Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?
howard_wolowitz Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.
mikayla Esther Rosenblatt.
penny I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here.
sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
penny Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one I’m going with.
sheldon_cooper I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head.
penny Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
sheldon_cooper May I say one last thing.
penny Only if it doesn’t rhyme.
sheldon_cooper Alright. Goodnight.
mikayla Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.
howard_wolowitz Really, me too.
mikayla Oy gevalt, you’re hot.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’s it going.
howard_wolowitz Cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
howard_wolowitz She’s a hooker, isn’t she.
raj_koothrappali A prostitute, yes.
howard_wolowitz You already gave her the money?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
howard_wolowitz Thank you!
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I can’t sleep. how are you going?
penny Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
sheldon_cooper I’m homesick.
penny Your home is twenty feet from here.
sheldon_cooper Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. It’s in a galaxy far, far away.
penny Damn it. What do you want me to do
sheldon_cooper Sing soft kitty.
penny That’s only for when you’re sick.
sheldon_cooper Homesick is a type of being sick.
penny Come on, do I really have to?
sheldon_cooper I suppose we can stay up and talk.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…
sheldon_cooper Sleepy kitty.
penny Sleepy ki…
sheldon_cooper No. Start over.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for letting me stay here.
penny Oh, you’re welcome sweetie.
sheldon_cooper Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, you’re finally home.
leonard_hofstadter What were you doing at Penny’s?
sheldon_cooper Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.
