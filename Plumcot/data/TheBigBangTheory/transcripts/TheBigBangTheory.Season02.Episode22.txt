sheldon_cooper Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!
howard_wolowitz They’re on me today, boys.
raj_koothrappali You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
howard_wolowitz No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
raj_koothrappali Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.
leonard_hofstadter Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
howard_wolowitz Is that supposed to be funny?
sheldon_cooper I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
howard_wolowitz Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
raj_koothrappali He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.
sheldon_cooper Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
stuart_bloom Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s mind-blowing.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, spoiler alert.
stuart_bloom I didn’t spoil anything.
sheldon_cooper You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
stuart_bloom I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Said the Grinch to Christmas.
stuart_bloom Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, sure, what’s up?
stuart_bloom Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, vaguely.
raj_koothrappali Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
leonard_hofstadter What about it?
stuart_bloom Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that well.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
stuart_bloom I can’t do that.
leonard_hofstadter Why the hell not?
stuart_bloom ‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?
stuart_bloom No.
sheldon_cooper Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.
stuart_bloom Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up.
leonard_hofstadter Nobody wants that.
stuart_bloom So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
stuart_bloom Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, or you call me.
stuart_bloom Great.
leonard_hofstadter Or nobody calls anyone.
raj_koothrappali Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
leonard_hofstadter You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
howard_wolowitz Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
leonard_hofstadter I’m listening.
howard_wolowitz Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
penny Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
penny How’s it going?
leonard_hofstadter Good, good. You?
penny Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
penny You know your friend Stuart?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
penny Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
leonard_hofstadter About what?
penny Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
leonard_hofstadter No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.
penny Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!
penny Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
leonard_hofstadter About Stuart? Love to.
penny He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.
penny Really?
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. It’s Stuart.
sheldon_cooper You’re not going to answer it?
leonard_hofstadter He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
sheldon_cooper You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.
leonard_hofstadter Why would he call me?
sheldon_cooper We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Answer the phone, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter No! There, it went to voice mail.
sheldon_cooper Aren’t you going to check your messages?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
leonard_hofstadter It must be hell inside your head.
sheldon_cooper At times.
howard_wolowitz Guys, we have a code red.
sheldon_cooper Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
howard_wolowitz Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
leonard_hofstadter How teeny tiny?
howard_wolowitz It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
sheldon_cooper But the mission is for six months.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
sheldon_cooper Have you notified NASA?
howard_wolowitz No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
leonard_hofstadter Well, what are you gonna do?
howard_wolowitz I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them.
leonard_hofstadter So, what do you need us for?
raj_koothrappali He can’t figure out how to fix it.
howard_wolowitz Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.
raj_koothrappali I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
sheldon_cooper I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
howard_wolowitz All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
raj_koothrappali Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
leonard_hofstadter Good one.
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
raj_koothrappali You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
stuart_bloom Hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey Stuart.
stuart_bloom You busy?
leonard_hofstadter Um…
howard_wolowitz Classified, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?
stuart_bloom Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.
stuart_bloom Or e-mail.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.
stuart_bloom Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
leonard_hofstadter All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
stuart_bloom Okay.
leonard_hofstadter You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.
stuart_bloom Fear?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break.
stuart_bloom Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
leonard_hofstadter Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.
stuart_bloom Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?
howard_wolowitz You don’t know what this is?
stuart_bloom No.
howard_wolowitz Good. Get out.
raj_koothrappali Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
sheldon_cooper For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
sheldon_cooper All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?
howard_wolowitz No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
leonard_hofstadter I feel terrible.
howard_wolowitz Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.
leonard_hofstadter I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
raj_koothrappali Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
sheldon_cooper You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?
raj_koothrappali It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.
howard_wolowitz Speaking of what goes around comes around…
raj_koothrappali Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
sheldon_cooper It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
raj_koothrappali What if we reposition the collection tank?
sheldon_cooper It won’t work. No way to mount it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
sheldon_cooper That could work.
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
penny Morning. What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
penny Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
leonard_hofstadter Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
penny I really don’t want to talk about it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…
penny I said I don’t want to talk about it.
leonard_hofstadter Okay… I just… I kind of…
penny Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?
raj_koothrappali If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
sheldon_cooper You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I know what I’m doing.
sheldon_cooper If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
raj_koothrappali Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
howard_wolowitz Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
raj_koothrappali That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
howard_wolowitz Where are you going?
leonard_hofstadter Comic book store.
sheldon_cooper Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.
raj_koothrappali Me, too.
howard_wolowitz Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
sheldon_cooper Why does Leonard get to go?
leonard_hofstadter ‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks for understanding, Howard.
howard_wolowitz I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.
raj_koothrappali Wow, that’s heavy.
howard_wolowitz Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations.
sheldon_cooper I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.
howard_wolowitz Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one.
sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
raj_koothrappali What do you think the problem is?
howard_wolowitz Not enough bread crumbs.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
stuart_bloom Sure, what’s up?
leonard_hofstadter I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.
stuart_bloom No, your advice was great.
leonard_hofstadter It was?
stuart_bloom Yeah, going slow really worked.
leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
stuart_bloom Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
leonard_hofstadter Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
stuart_bloom It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell.
leonard_hofstadter During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
stuart_bloom No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.
leonard_hofstadter Leonard?
stuart_bloom That is your name, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.
stuart_bloom Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.
leonard_hofstadter No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out.
stuart_bloom Not your fault.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, how about that? See you soon.
stuart_bloom Yeah, sure.
howard_wolowitz Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.
penny What’s classified?
leonard_hofstadter Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
howard_wolowitz Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works.
sheldon_cooper I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true.
penny Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, were you talking to me?
penny Yeah, I said Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you did, didn’t you?
penny What the hell is that?
howard_wolowitz Meatloaf.
leonard_hofstadter What was it doing on the ceiling?
howard_wolowitz That’s classified.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We’d like to make an unscheduled space walk.
ground_controller ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
iss_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 Houston, we’d all like to step outside for a few minutes.
ground_controller ISS, I’m afraid we can’t authorize that.
iss_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.
