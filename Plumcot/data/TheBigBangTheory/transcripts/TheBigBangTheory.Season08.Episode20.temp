raj You’re wrong.
howard No, I’m not.
raj Yes, you are.
howard No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?
leonard Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.
raj The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
howard I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?
sheldon Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.
howard Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
sheldon I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.
leonard Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.
howard Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass.
sheldon You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
leonard Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
sheldon Agreed.
leonard I was gonna say or, but why bother?
bernadette Hey, Raj.
raj Hey, I got you a little gift.
bernadette Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.
raj You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?
howard Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.
raj Wow, so you’re not curious at all?
howard Nope.
raj Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.
wil_wheaton Thanks again for agreeing to do this.
penny Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.
leonard Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
penny Those are Star Trek people.
leonard Yes.
penny I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.
wil I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.
penny Sorry.
wil Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we’re gonna take some calls, we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.
leonard This is exciting.
penny Yeah, so, how many people listen?
wil Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.
penny What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
wil Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.
amy Can you please pass the salt?
sheldon Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
amy Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
sheldon I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?
amy No, Sheldon.
sheldon Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.
amy According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
sheldon You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
amy Well, it applies to you, too.
sheldon I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.
raj So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?
bernadette You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.
raj You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.
howard Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down.
bernadette Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball.
howard Can I help you?
guy_at_door Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?
howard Yes.
guy Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.
howard Wuh, uh, who’s your father?
guy Sam Wolowitz.
howard Sam Wolowitz is my father.
guy I know.
howard Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?
guy I think so.
howard Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.
wil Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.
leonard Psst.
wil I’ve just been handed a note. I’m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.
leonard I, I didn’t want to interrupt.
wil Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny’s fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don’t you grab some headphones and join us?
leonard Really?
wil Yeah.
leonard Hey, great.
wil So, while Leonard gets set up, let’s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.
caller I don’t have a question. I just want to say I’m a big fan of the movie. I’ve seen it, like, ten times.
penny Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.
wil Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.
penny Really?
wil Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.
leonard Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.
wil All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.
kevn Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me.
penny Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.
leonard It really is.
kevin Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.
penny Oh, wow. I wish it was better.
wil Oh, don’t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin’s films?
kevin You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.
penny Aw.
wil You know, I’m in the movie, too.
kevin Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute.
penny Seriously?
kevin Oh, yeah, man. I’m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I’ve ever done before. It’s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.
penny Oh, my, I would love that.
leonard You have a new job.
penny Well, maybe I can do both.
leonard I don’t think you can do both.
penny I don’t think I asked you.
kevin Yeah, you tell him, Penny.
leonard Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.
sheldon Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
amy Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
sheldon You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.
amy Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
sheldon Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself.
amy When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
sheldon I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.
amy And at the same time, not.
sheldon It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.
amy You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.
sheldon Isn’t that a little juvenile?
amy More juvenile than this?
sheldon I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
howard You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.
bernadette Oh, let me do it, Howard.
howard No, I got it.
bernadette So, Josh, what do you do?
josh I’m studying oceanography down in San Diego.
bernadette Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.
raj Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
josh Why would I lie?
raj Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?
josh No.
raj A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?
josh No.
raj You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
bernadette Why don’t you help with the coffee?
raj Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?
howard Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?
raj I get it. What do you want to do?
howard I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this.
raj All right, I’ve got your back.
howard Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.
josh I can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut. That’s amazing. What was it like?
raj Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road.
howard Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.
wil So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star…
leonard No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.
wil All right. We’re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn’t believe women should have dreams.
leonard Give me back that juice.
penny What is the harm if I audition?
leonard Well, what if you get it?
penny I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.
leonard From a Kevin Smith movie?
kevin Oh, I’m hanging up now.
wil Don’t you listen to him, buddy. You’re awesome. You’re one of the greatest directors of our time.
kevin I don’t have a part for you, Wheaton.
wil And that was Kevin Smith.
penny Thanks a lot.
leonard I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
penny Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?
leonard I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
penny Decent? I make twice what you make.
leonard Wait, twice?
penny Yeah.
leonard Like, times two twice?
wil For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let’s listen.
leonard I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
penny Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
leonard Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
wil For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.
amy How’s it going, Sheldon?
sheldon Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
amy Can I come in?
sheldon Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.
amy Amazing.
sheldon I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.
amy What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.
sheldon Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
howard I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
josh Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.
bernadette Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?
josh Sorry, I have a long drive.
howard Well, I hope I get to see you again.
josh I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.
bernadette Keep dreaming.
howard Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.
josh Wow.
bernadette He did it with a robot.
josh You had sex with a robot?
howard That’s not what she meant.
raj But technically, yes.
leonard Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?
penny In a safe place.
leonard What does that mean, under your bed?
penny No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.
leonard Wait a minute, you have a guy?
penny Don’t you have a guy?
leonard Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
penny Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.
wil For those of you listening at home, how great is this?
leonard Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.
wil Sure. And we’re back.
penny Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.
leonard Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.
penny Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?
leonard That would be great, thank you.
wil I’m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you’re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?
leonard Yes, it is, Wil.
josh So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?
howard It was actually just a mechanical hand.
josh ‘Cause that’s all you need, right?
howard You are my brother.
sheldon Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.
amy I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold.
sheldon Mm-hmm.
amy And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.
sheldon Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner.
amy We both know this one’s gonna win.
sheldon Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.
amy Come on, I’ll help you take this down.
sheldon Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?
amy Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.
sheldon That’s a big step.
amy It’s a big fort.
sheldon Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.
amy PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
sheldon G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.
amy You got yourself a sleepover.
sheldon Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
amy Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
sheldon It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?
amy Who says this is the only one I hid?
leonard Hello? What is this?
sheldon We built a fort.
leonard Are those my sheets?
amy Yes, they are.
leonard Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.
sheldon Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?
leonard Yeah, I’m good.
sheldon Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.
leonard Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
sheldon I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.
leonard Thank you.
amy Okay, have a seat on the floor.
sheldon Not there. That’s my spot.
