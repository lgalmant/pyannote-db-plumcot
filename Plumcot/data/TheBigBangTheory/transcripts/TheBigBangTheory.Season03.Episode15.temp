howard Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I’ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?
raj Dude, I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?
sheldon Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.
howard That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
raj Thank you.
howard Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk.
leonard Who’s miserable and alone?
raj Me.
leonard Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
sheldon In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.
leonard Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?
howard Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
sheldon Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
howard I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.
raj Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
raj Fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny.
leonard That’s not what I was going to tell you.
raj It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
leonard Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
sheldon Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
leonard Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
howard I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
raj The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
howard That’s the one.
leonard In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him.
sheldon In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
leonard Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
howard Oh, man!
raj No way, dude!
sheldon This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing.
raj Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
leonard I am taking Penny.
raj Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
leonard Sheldon, you got a minute?
sheldon Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?
leonard Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland.
sheldon Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?
leonard Penny.
sheldon What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
leonard Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
sheldon But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
leonard I’m sorry, Sheldon.
sheldon Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
leonard Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six.
sheldon Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
penny Okay, what’s the big surprise?
leonard Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
penny Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
leonard No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
penny Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here.
leonard Uh-huh.
penny We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
leonard How does that involve air travel?
penny We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
leonard No.
penny Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it.
leonard We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
penny We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!
leonard Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day.
penny Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!
sheldon Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.
penny My Rabe-what-ly?
sheldon Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.
leonard Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny.
sheldon Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
leonard Not the roommate agreement.
sheldon Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.
leonard Oh, for God’s sakes.
penny You actually put that in an agreement?
leonard Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
sheldon He can’t kill me, even if I turn.
penny Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
sheldon No, that seemed a little farfetched.
leonard Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
sheldon I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
penny Okay, I know I shouldn’t ask, but what is…?
leonard No.
sheldon I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice.
leonard Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.
sheldon Is that your final decision?
leonard It is.
sheldon Very well.
penny It’s not over, is it?
leonard What do you think?
leonard Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games.
sheldon All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
sheldon You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
leonard Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
sheldon Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
leonard Rupert Murdoch?
sheldon He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
howard I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.
raj I know. I saw the Tweet.
howard So, what did you end up doing?
raj Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
leonard You seen Sheldon?
raj No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
leonard Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?
howard I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland.
leonard Seriously?
howard Absolutely. And I’d leave him there.
raj What the hell is that?
leonard Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.
sheldon Morning, old chum.
leonard What’s going on?
sheldon I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo.
leonard You made Frodo pancakes?
sheldon Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
leonard Why are you doing this?
sheldon It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
leonard Thanks. It’s good.
sheldon What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
leonard You hate Babylon 5.
sheldon I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend.
leonard Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.
sheldon Drat. No Frodo for you.
sheldon Hello.
penny Hello.
sheldon Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here.
penny Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
sheldon Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room.
penny Better acoustics for your throat singing?
sheldon It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.
penny Oh, for God’s sakes.
sheldon Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
penny I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
sheldon Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
penny Okay, show’s over.
sheldon No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides.
penny Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
sheldon Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
penny I’ll talk to Leonard.
sheldon You will?
penny Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.
sheldon Oh, Penny, thank you!
penny You’re welcome.
sheldon Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration.
penny I think we’re there.
sheldon Oh, good. Bye-bye.
raj You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day.
howard Trust me, you can’t. I’ve tried.
raj No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
leonard Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
sheldon All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?
leonard Some what?
sheldon Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
leonard You’re not going to Switzerland!
sheldon Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?
leonard She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
sheldon Yes, that good news.
leonard Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!
sheldon Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
leonard I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
sheldon That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
leonard Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.
sheldon Really?
leonard Yeah, really.
sheldon Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.
leonard I’m sorry you feel that way.
sheldon I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
leonard Why don’t you enlighten me?
sheldon With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
howard Ooh, that’s gotta sting.
leonard Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day.
penny I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
leonard Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
penny Think it through, Leonard.
leonard Oh!
penny Oh!
leonard Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?
penny No, no, it’s probably just allergies.
leonard Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.
penny Do any of them work?
leonard Not really, I’m just an enthusiast.
leonard Penny? You okay?
penny Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
leonard What’s going on?
penny I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
leonard Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?
penny Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.
leonard Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come.
sheldon Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. Oh, look, it’s the cholermus.
penny Here’s your soup.
sheldon Chicken?
penny Yes.
sheldon With the little stars?
penny Yes.
sheldon Heated to 180 degrees?
penny Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.
sheldon You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
penny Yeah, well, I’m sick, too.
sheldon Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
penny I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon.
sheldon It’s you! I touched you!
penny Happy Valentine’s Day.
raj Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
leonard Yeah, I forgot about all this.
raj But I never will.
