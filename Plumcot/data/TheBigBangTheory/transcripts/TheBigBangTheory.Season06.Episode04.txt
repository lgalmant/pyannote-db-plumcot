raj_koothrappali Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
leonard_hofstadter It’ll be good to have him back.
raj_koothrappali The Fantastic Four reunited.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership.
raj_koothrappali We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
sheldon_cooper Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.
stuart_bloom I can go thirty.
sheldon_cooper Welcome aboard, old chum.
raj_koothrappali Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
sheldon_cooper He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.
dimitri Loops, calm down!
howard_wolowitz Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz
mike_massimino What’s that?
howard_wolowitz The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!
mike_massimino That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Waiting for my husband.
man_in_suit#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 That’s nice.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s coming back from outer space.
man_in_suit#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 I think this flight’s coming from Houston.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!
various_others#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 Howie! Howie!
howard_wolowitz Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.
howie_mandel Uh, I think they’re here for me, Ringo.
man_in_suit#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 Mr. Mandel, I’m your driver.
howie_mandel Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he’s an astronaut.
bernadette_rostenkowski I missed you so much.
howard_wolowitz I missed you, too. Where are the guys?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, it’s just me.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me.
howard_wolowitz Gesundheit. You okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants.
howard_wolowitz Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.
sheldon_cooper You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.
amy_farrah_fowler Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
penny You’re unbelievable.
sheldon_cooper I know.
leonard_hofstadter All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?
penny How about boys versus girls?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.
penny Once again, unbelievable.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, once again, I know.
penny All right, round one. Here.
sheldon_cooper Got it.
penny Okay. Ready, set, go.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, box? Uh, window?
leonard_hofstadter Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, gift? Uh, Present!
penny Present! Yeah!
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?
leonard_hofstadter In what universe is that a present?
sheldon_cooper It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.
penny Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.
sheldon_cooper It’s a quark-gluon plasma.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
leonard_hofstadter Nothing with quarks.
sheldon_cooper It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
leonard_hofstadter How could you miss that?
sheldon_cooper Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.
leonard_hofstadter Penny got it.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?
penny Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
sheldon_cooper There.
leonard_hofstadter A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…
amy_farrah_fowler Now?
penny Soon.
sheldon_cooper Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?
penny All right, that’s enough.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?
penny Yep!
sheldon_cooper Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.
penny Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.
sheldon_cooper Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
howard_wolowitz Bernie, you okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I’ll be right there.
howard_wolowitz Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s just allergies.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?
howard_wolowitz Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…
bernadette_rostenkowski Ew. Excuse me.
howard_wolowitz Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.
howard_wolowitz You okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Now, kiss me.
howard_wolowitz Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?
bernadette_rostenkowski That was amazing. You made me feel things I never…
howard_wolowitz Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.
penny Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?
sheldon_cooper Don’t know.
penny I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
sheldon_cooper I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.
sheldon_cooper Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
penny All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
sheldon_cooper All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.
penny Oh, come on, what is that?
sheldon_cooper It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?
leonard_hofstadter En el acelerador de particulares.
sheldon_cooper Bueno, mi amigo.
penny No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.
sheldon_cooper All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.
leonard_hofstadter Just pick another game.
amy_farrah_fowler Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
leonard_hofstadter No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.
sheldon_cooper That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?
sheldon_cooper No, that’s not fair either.
penny Why not?
sheldon_cooper Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s when it started.
sheldon_cooper Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out.
penny Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…
amy_farrah_fowler We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-uh.
penny I don’t think so.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.
debbie_wolowitz Howard? I thought I wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.
debbie_wolowitz Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I’m not decent.
howard_wolowitz All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?
mans_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?
debbie_wolowitz Shh, you need to whisper.
howard_wolowitz Ma, who is in there?
debbie_wolowitz Uh, nobody. The TV is on.
mans_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 I only got one sock. Where’s my other sock?
howard_wolowitz Who is that?
debbie_wolowitz I told you, it’s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it’s hilarious.
howard_wolowitz If you’re busy, I can come back.
debbie_wolowitz Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.
howard_wolowitz Dr. Schneider?
dr_schneider Oh, hello, Howard.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing here?
dr_schneider Um, house call.
howard_wolowitz You’re a dentist.
dr_schneider Yes, yes, I am. I think he’s on to us.
penny Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.
sheldon_cooper Hurry up, find him, find him.
leonard_hofstadter I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.
sheldon_cooper For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.
leonard_hofstadter I know what he looks like.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, there he is, I got him.
penny Yes, we win again.
sheldon_cooper How could you not find him?
leonard_hofstadter Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo.
leonard_hofstadter 57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.
amy_farrah_fowler Long division, long division. Go, go, go.
leonard_hofstadter Remember, show your work.
sheldon_cooper I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.
leonard_hofstadter Get up, we can’t lose at math.
penny 37.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Ready, set, wrestle. One, two, three, pin.
penny Mwah!
sheldon_cooper Stop that.
penny Mwah!
sheldon_cooper Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.
howard_wolowitz One to beam aboard?
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.
raj_koothrappali Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist.
raj_koothrappali Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
howard_wolowitz Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
raj_koothrappali So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
howard_wolowitz It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.
stuart_bloom Oh, hey, man, welcome back.
howard_wolowitz Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?
stuart_bloom I, I kind of live here now.
raj_koothrappali Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
stuart_bloom Ah, he’s spoiling me and I love it.
howard_wolowitz Wow, so you guys are like buds now?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.
stuart_bloom Plus, he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes.
stuart_bloom Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.
raj_koothrappali Which part?
stuart_bloom Just all of it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?
stuart_bloom Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.
howard_wolowitz Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
howard_wolowitz So I’d be sitting by myself?
raj_koothrappali We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
stuart_bloom So I, I, I’d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?
howard_wolowitz No, no, you guys go. Have fun.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?
howard_wolowitz Absolutely. See you, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?
howard_wolowitz At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
penny All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.
amy_farrah_fowler On the count of three. One, two…
sheldon_cooper Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.
sheldon_cooper That’s rude.
amy_farrah_fowler One, two, three, eat.
howard_wolowitz Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space.
all@ Not now!
sheldon_cooper Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!
leonard_hofstadter Snort it down and keep eating!
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 You look familiar.
howard_wolowitz I don’t think so.
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You’re an astronaut.
howard_wolowitz Yes. Yes, I am.
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?
howard_wolowitz Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, I went to my mom…
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 You want the cheesecake or not?
howard_wolowitz Yes, please. And I think it’s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find I’m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I’m a rocket man. Perfect.
