penny You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.
leonard Hmm?
penny This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.
leonard You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
penny No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.
leonard You’re a hero.
penny Yeah, that was the point of the story.
leonard Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?
penny Um, I think so. Why?
leonard What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day.
penny Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.
leonard You could be a little more into it.
penny No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.
leonard Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!
penny You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.
sheldon So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.
amy I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine’s Day?
sheldon Oh, you caught that, did you?
howard Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.
raj Everything okay?
howard Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.
raj Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?
stuart Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?
raj Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.
stuart There must be something we can do.
raj Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?
raj Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.
stuart That’s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.
sheldon Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.
alex Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.
sheldon Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.
alex You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.
sheldon Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.
leonard Hey, you coming to lunch?
howard Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.
leonard What you looking at?
howard Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s been such a pain in the ass.
leonard You can’t find a card that says that?
howard Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
leonard Oh, that’s cool.
howard A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
leonard From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
howard Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.
leonard Oh, wow.
howard Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?
leonard Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
howard Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of…
leonard Want to come to dinner with us?
howard Yes, please.
sheldon Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.
alex Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy’s Facebook page and read up on her interests.
sheldon Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.
alex Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.
sheldon Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?
alex No, I just thought it would be…
sheldon Next.
alex Okay. Um, I know she’s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.
sheldon Mmm.
alex So I found this cool map that illustrates the character’s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.
sheldon But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.
alex I don’t know how to respond to that.
sheldon Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.
alex Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.
sheldon Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.
alex Thank you.
sheldon I think I’ll keep it for myself.
alex What about your girlfriend?
sheldon It’s too late. I call dibs.
penny This place is really beautiful.
leonard Waugh, romance ninja.
penny Hey.
howard Sorry we’re late.
penny No problem. We just sat down.
leonard Mmm, would you like some wine?
bernadette Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop.
penny Is everything okay?
howard Terrific. Couldn’t be better.
bernadette Oh, bite me.
howard Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.
bernadette Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you.
leonard Uh, where what is?
howard She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m telling.
bernadette I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.
howard I said I’m sorry.
bernadette Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.
howard I told you, turn them inside out.
bernadette And I told you to bite me.
leonard Trying to have a magical night here, guys.
penny Oh, son of a bitch.
leonard What?
penny Nothing. Nothing.
leonard No, tell me.
penny It’s just this guy I used to date.
leonard Oh.
penny Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s here with him now.
leonard You’re kidding.
penny And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.
leonard I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night.
penny No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s dying.
leonard That’s the spirit.
penny You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.
leonard Yeah.
bernadette Uh-oh.
penny What? Oh, you got to be kidding me.
gretchen Oh, my God, yes. Of course I’ll marry you.
leonard Two can play this game. Penny…
penny Get up.
leonard All right.
raj It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.
stuart Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. In fact, there’s no place I would rather be than here.
raj Except on a date with anybody.
stuart Literally anybody.
raj You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.
stuart What?
raj Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.
stuart That does sound nice.
raj Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.
stuart What?
penny Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.
leonard Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.
penny What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.
bernadette They do look happy.
howard Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.
leonard You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?
penny Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.
leonard I thought we were letting it go.
penny We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me.
leonard Um, it did end happy for you. You’re here with me.
penny Yeah, yeah, I know.
leonard Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.
penny Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.
leonard Oh, I’m not. It’s about you.
penny Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day sucks.
leonard This one does, and you’re the reason why.
penny What?
bernadette You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good about us.
howard Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I’ll do that laundry.
bernadette Thank you.
howard I love you.
bernadette Love you, too.
howard So where’d you hide it?
bernadette Where you’d never look.
howard Damn it, it’s in the washing machine.
amy Hello.
sheldon Hello.
amy Happy Valentine’s Day.
sheldon Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
amy Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.
sheldon Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.
amy And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day.
sheldon What is that?
amy By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.
sheldon Really?
amy Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?
sheldon More than anything.
amy Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do.
sheldon Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.
amy I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.
sheldon No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
amy What’s this?
sheldon Read it.
amy Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?
sheldon At the bottom.
amy In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me.
sheldon Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?
amy And you picked me.
sheldon It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.
amy Oh, Sheldon.
sheldon Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.
penny Night.
leonard Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.
penny Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.
leonard I’m not saying that.
penny Well, I am.
leonard Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?
penny I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.
leonard Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.
penny Obviously, I have some commitment issues.
leonard Glaringly obvious. Go on.
penny As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.
leonard Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
penny What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?
leonard No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.
penny Really?
leonard Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.
penny Yeah, you got it.
leonard And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
penny Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.
leonard You do?
penny Leonard Hofstadter?
leonard Yes?
penny Will you be my valentine?
leonard Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!
nerdy_guy Thank you, guys, for doing this.
raj We’re glad you could make it.
nerdy_guy Usually I spend Valentine’s Day sad and alone. This year, I’m just sad.
raj What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
stuart I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight’s the night I know everyone else does, too.
nerdy_guy I think you’re cool.
stuart Great.
raj I got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone.
girl That was cool. What you said.
raj You really think so?
girl Yeah, I do.
raj Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?
girl Okay.
raj Later, losers!
amy Hello? Another medical emergency? What’s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.
