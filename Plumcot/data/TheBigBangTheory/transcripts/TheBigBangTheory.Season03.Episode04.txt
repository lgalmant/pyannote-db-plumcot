sheldon_cooper This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
sheldon_cooper Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?
penny Hi, guys. Hi, honey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
penny You’re boring people sweetie.
sheldon_cooper Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.
penny So, what are you guys doing?
howard_wolowitz Celebrating Columbus Day.
leonard_hofstadter We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.
penny Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
sheldon_cooper The parade.
penny Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.
leonard_hofstadter What’s he on trial for?
penny Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. I’ll be there.
sheldon_cooper Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
penny I guess I could serve both.
sheldon_cooper You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
penny Tur-briska-fil?
howard_wolowitz Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.
penny Raj, what about you?
howard_wolowitz Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.
leonard_hofstadter So, what’s going on with Raj?
howard_wolowitz Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil.
penny Hard to believe, but go on.
howard_wolowitz The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean, he’s getting deported?
sheldon_cooper I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.
howard_wolowitz Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?
penny Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
sheldon_cooper Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession.
howard_wolowitz Okay, she’s gone.
raj_koothrappali Sorry. I lost my cool.
leonard_hofstadter So, what’s going on?
raj_koothrappali Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
howard_wolowitz So?
raj_koothrappali So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
leonard_hofstadter So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?
raj_koothrappali You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
sheldon_cooper And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere.
howard_wolowitz Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?
penny Why doesn’t he just get another job?
howard_wolowitz What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not.
raj_koothrappali Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry, you’ll find another job.
raj_koothrappali Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
sheldon_cooper Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Hello Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated.
raj_koothrappali I’m sad.
sheldon_cooper I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
raj_koothrappali What are you eating?
sheldon_cooper Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
raj_koothrappali Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
raj_koothrappali We believe cows are gods.
sheldon_cooper Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
raj_koothrappali Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry.
raj_koothrappali Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge.
sheldon_cooper Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
sheldon_cooper And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.
raj_koothrappali You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!
howard_wolowitz Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.
raj_koothrappali I’m on it.
sheldon_cooper That’s happy, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Nailed it.
professor_laughlin Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?
raj_koothrappali No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
professor_laughlin Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?
raj_koothrappali It’s a little early, isn’t it?
professor_laughlin Not on Proxima Centauri.
raj_koothrappali That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.
professor_laughlin Oh, well done. I have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.
raj_koothrappali Thank you, sir.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 I’m sorry. Am I late?
professor_laughlin No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She’ll be heading up our data analysis team.
dr_catherine_millstone It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias?
raj_koothrappali Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
dr_catherine_millstone That’s just fascinating.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?
howard_wolowitz What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?
raj_koothrappali You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.
raj_koothrappali That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.
howard_wolowitz I’m really going to miss you.
raj_koothrappali Will you come visit me in India?
howard_wolowitz Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?
raj_koothrappali Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
howard_wolowitz Tell you what, we’ll skype.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.
raj_koothrappali You want me to work with you?
sheldon_cooper For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
sheldon_cooper For me.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, are you busy?
sheldon_cooper Of course I’m busy.
raj_koothrappali Shall I wait?
sheldon_cooper Yes, please. How may I help you?
raj_koothrappali I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
sheldon_cooper For me.
raj_koothrappali Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
sheldon_cooper I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
sheldon_cooper I reject them all.
raj_koothrappali Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview.
raj_koothrappali Wha… You’re kidding!
sheldon_cooper Please.
raj_koothrappali All right.
sheldon_cooper So, that’s what you wear to an interview?
raj_koothrappali Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years.
sheldon_cooper Oh, pulling strings, are we?
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg.
sheldon_cooper Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
penny Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.
penny Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?
leonard_hofstadter What are you thinking?
penny Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.
leonard_hofstadter You are a dirty girl.
penny Oh, God, how did he know?
howard_wolowitz Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Am I interrupting?
leonard_hofstadter Little bit, yeah.
howard_wolowitz Guess I should have called.
penny Yeah, maybe.
howard_wolowitz Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
howard_wolowitz But he’s working with Sheldon.
penny Yes, we know.
howard_wolowitz Want me to leave?
leonard_hofstadter You know, whatever.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.
penny Hey, I happen to love this movie.
howard_wolowitz Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
sheldon_cooper All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
sheldon_cooper I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
raj_koothrappali Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
sheldon_cooper This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.
raj_koothrappali All right, let’s buckle down and work.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What?
raj_koothrappali I need an aspirin.
sheldon_cooper Top desk drawer.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Alright?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
sheldon_cooper Good.
leonard_hofstadter That was fun. Thank you.
penny Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
howard_wolowitz Top o’ the mornin’o ya!
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
howard_wolowitz Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour.
penny Oh, kill me.
howard_wolowitz By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.
penny See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that.
howard_wolowitz What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?
penny Do something.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.
howard_wolowitz Sure. ‘sup, homes?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
howard_wolowitz Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.
penny That’s great.
howard_wolowitz Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun.
leonard_hofstadter Good.
penny Are we terrible people?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
penny Get him, bring him back.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Howard come back.
howard_wolowitz Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.
raj_koothrappali No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
sheldon_cooper Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
raj_koothrappali I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
sheldon_cooper Astro means star.
raj_koothrappali Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt.
sheldon_cooper English is your native language.
raj_koothrappali Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!
sheldon_cooper There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
raj_koothrappali My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
sheldon_cooper Caca?
raj_koothrappali It means doo-doo.
sheldon_cooper All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…
raj_koothrappali Aha! So I am working with you.
sheldon_cooper In this context, with me means for me.
raj_koothrappali Ah, well, in this context…
sheldon_cooper Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.
raj_koothrappali Let me finish.
sheldon_cooper You’re defacing my work.
raj_koothrappali I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it.
sheldon_cooper Give me the eraser.
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper I said give it to me.
raj_koothrappali Come and get it.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!
raj_koothrappali You are not my superior.
sheldon_cooper I am in every way.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah? Can you do this? Nice working with you. I’m sorry, for you.
sheldon_cooper Raj. Raj. Raj.
raj_koothrappali I’m busy.
sheldon_cooper Doing what? All right, you’ve made your point.
raj_koothrappali What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
raj_koothrappali So you were wrong.
sheldon_cooper I didn’t say that.
raj_koothrappali That’s the only logical inference.
sheldon_cooper Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
raj_koothrappali For you or with you?
sheldon_cooper In this context for me could mean with me.
raj_koothrappali All right, but I have some conditions.
sheldon_cooper I reject them all.
raj_koothrappali I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
sheldon_cooper Wait, you have to drive me home.
raj_koothrappali How did you get here?
sheldon_cooper I walked.
raj_koothrappali So walk home.
sheldon_cooper I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
raj_koothrappali All right.
