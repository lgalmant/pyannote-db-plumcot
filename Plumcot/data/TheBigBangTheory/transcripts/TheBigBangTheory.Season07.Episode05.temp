penny Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night.
amy It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
sheldon Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.
penny How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
sheldon If you do that, I’ll scream.
amy Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.
sheldon That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.
amy I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool.
sheldon You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win.
amy So, you’re okay with this?
sheldon Well, why wouldn’t I be?
amy Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.
sheldon My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?
amy Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace.
sheldon Really?
amy Yes.
sheldon Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.
amy I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.
sheldon Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady.
howard Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
sheldon Why not? Hairy Fairy.
raj I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work.
leonard Your father’s a gynaecologist.
raj I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.
howard Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?
leonard No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.
sheldon That’s a Raging Ogre.
leonard Yeah, I know.
howard I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?
raj Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
howard Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.
sheldon Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.
leonard Please let me be there when you tell her that.
sheldon Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
leonard Please, oh, please, just let me be there.
bernadette So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?
amy I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
bernadette If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes.
amy Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?
bernadette You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.
penny You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.
sheldon Amy, Bernadette, Penny. Amy, Bernadette, Penny. Amy, Bernadette, Penny.
bernadette He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?
amy I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
sheldon Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.
amy Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque.
sheldon Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.
penny Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.
sheldon Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.
bernadette He said what?
sheldon Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious.
bernadette Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.
sheldon Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?
amy No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project.
penny Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do.
sheldon Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public.
penny That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
amy Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together.
sheldon Really?
amy Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.
sheldon Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
amy More and more sure.
sheldon Well, then, you have my permission.
amy I didn’t ask for your permission.
sheldon Too late. No backsies.
howard No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
sheldon Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway.
bernadette Well?
howard Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other.
sheldon Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.
howard For the love of God, why?
bernadette What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
raj His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
howard It’s nothing in particular. I…
bernadette Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
howard My arm is feeling numb.
leonard Nailed it.
bernadette That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus.
howard My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.
bernadette Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
howard Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?
bernadette Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
howard Bernie…
sheldon If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.
leonard So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?
raj It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.
howard Please, stop talking.
raj As you wish.
howard I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you.
sheldon Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.
amy Gentlemen.
raj Amy.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
leonard That was kind of icy. You two okay?
sheldon Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries.
leonard Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.
sheldon Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.
raj Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?
howard I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.
raj That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
amy And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
sheldon Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?
amy Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?
sheldon Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?
amy Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking.
sheldon Dr. Fowler?
amy What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!
amy Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?
sheldon Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?
amy Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
sheldon So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.
amy I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor.
sheldon What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
amy You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.
sheldon Aw. Embarrassed you?
amy You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.
sheldon I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
amy Really? What tipped you off?
sheldon Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…
amy Get out.
sheldon Well, now, that.
amy Image number six, woman giving birth.
sheldon Bleugh!
leonard It’s nine o’clock, where you been?
sheldon Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.
penny Oh, no.
sheldon Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
leonard I did not.
sheldon Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.
penny Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.
sheldon I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.
leonard I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
sheldon Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice.
penny Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
sheldon Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?
penny Yeah.
sheldon But you didn’t even hear the details.
leonard Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong.
sheldon But you don’t even know…
leonard Doesn’t matter.
sheldon But, now, but in my defence…
leonard Doesn’t matter.
sheldon You’re not listening to my side of it.
penny Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?
sheldon Well…
penny Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.
howard Ooh, shrimp was spicy.
raj You want a TUMS?
howard You got the tropical fruit kind?
raj No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.
howard Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk. I’ll get it.
raj Thanks.
bernadette Hi.
howard Oh, hi.
bernadette I may have overreacted.
howard Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either.
bernadette It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
howard That’s not true.
bernadette It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings.
howard Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.
bernadette Why tomorrow?
howard Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game.
raj It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.
howard Should I go after you?
bernadette No!
howard Thanks for getting me in trouble.
sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
amy Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?
sheldon I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?
amy No.
sheldon Well, I cannot give this stuff away.
amy What do you want?
sheldon Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.
amy Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo.
sheldon I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.
amy What’s your point?
sheldon My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.
amy I like you, too.
sheldon Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it.
bernadette I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.
amy Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him.
penny All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.
leonard Laser’s warmed up.
howard Pull.
all Yeah!
