sheldon Here's the problem with teleportation.
leonard Lay it on me.
sheldon Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.
leonard How about that.
sheldon Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.
leonard Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
sheldon No, he would be exactly the same.
leonard That is a problem.
sheldon So, you see it too.
dr_gablehouser Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.
together Gablehouser.
gablehouser Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here.
leonard Graduate work, very impressive.
gablehouser And he's only fifteen years old.
sheldon Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.
dennis Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea.
leonard Advantage Kim.
gablehouser I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
dennis I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.
sheldon Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.
dennis Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.
gablehouser Dennis, we discussed this, we're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.
leonard Yes sir.
sheldon You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.
dennis I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition ... ooh, look, chocolate milk.
sheldon I sense a disturbance in the force.
leonard A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.
leonard So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.
dennis A year and a half.
leonard No kidding, you speak English really well.
dennis So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.
leonard What are you talking about?
dennis That.
sheldon He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.
dennis Is this part of the tour?
sheldon Nope. Goodbye.
leonard Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.
sheldon Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.
dennis Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
sheldon Keen observation, goodbye.
dennis You see where you went wrong, don't you?
sheldon Leonard.
leonard Huh, yeah?
sheldon Get him out.
leonard Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec center, they've got nautilus equipment.
dennis Do I look like I lift weights.
leonard Not heavy ones.
dennis It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
sheldon You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?
dennis Have you considered it?
sheldon Get him out Leonard.
leonard Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.
dennis Wow, you won the Stephenson award.
sheldon Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.
dennis Really, how old?
sheldon Fourteen and a half.
dennis You were the youngest person ever to win it.
leonard It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?
penny Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it? Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh? Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.
howard Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?
penny Sure. Raj, hug Howard.
sheldon Uh-uh-uh.
leonard Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
sheldon Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to ... you know, that other guy.
howard Antonio Salieri?
sheldon Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.
howard You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.
leonard Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.
sheldon Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.
penny I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?
leonard You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
sheldon Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.
penny So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.
sheldon Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything.
penny I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?
howard We liked Leonard.
leonard Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?
sheldon Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.
penny You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
sheldon Hey.
leonard Hey.
sheldon I've decided you're right. My career is not over.
leonard Great.
sheldon But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.
leonard Great.
sheldon So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you.
leonard Great.
sheldon What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
leonard Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help.
sheldon Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?
leonard Yes.
sheldon No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
leonard It would blow up.
sheldon Are you sure?
leonard Pretty sure.
sheldon Pretty sure's not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?
leonard Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.
sheldon Alright.
leonard Go away.
sheldon If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, you're name can go first ... I'm going.
howard It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now. Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it. How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?
sheldon So, this is engineering, huh?
howard I'll talk to you later.
sheldon Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.
howard Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon I just came by to say hello.
howard I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.
sheldon Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?
howard A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.
sheldon Really, how does it work?
howard When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.
sheldon Uh, huh. So it's a shelf?
howard No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide ... yeah, okay, it's a shelf.
sheldon Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.
howard Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.
sheldon And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.
howard Sheldon.
sheldon Yes.
howard Go away.
sheldon Did Leonard tell you to say that?
howard No, I thought of it all by myself.
sheldon Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.
raj Go away.
sheldon Curiouser and curiouser.
howard Is he here?
leonard If he were, I wouldn't be.
raj Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.
leonard Is that even possible?
raj As it turns out, yes.
howard Something's got to be done about him, Leonard.
leonard Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
raj Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
howard Then our problem would be solved.
leonard Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no.
howard We don't have to go that far, there are other means available.
raj We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
howard The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
leonard That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.
howard What about biology?
leonard What?
howard You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.
leonard Howard, he's fifteen.
howard Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.
raj She was sleeping with you?
howard No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.
sheldon Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. Go away? Hmm. Could it be me?
penny Oh, hey guys, what's up?
howard We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
penny What?
leonard Howard, that's racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick.
raj It's possible she may have misunderstood us.
gablehouser Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?
sheldon No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.
gablehouser Oh, what are you working on?
sheldon Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.
gablehouser To what end?
sheldon You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.
gablehouser Who will come?
sheldon The Jewish people.
gablehouser What if they don't come.
sheldon We'll make it nice, put out a spread.
gablehouser Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.
sheldon Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.
gablehouser Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your ... uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of ... um ... he's nuts.
sheldon Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize ...
sheldon I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?
goldfarb Go away.
sheldon We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
goldfarb Please go away.
sheldon Said Pharoah to Moses.
gablehouser Why are all these young women here?
leonard It's take your daughter to work day.
gablehouser Really, I was not aware of that.
raj Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
gablehouser Hm?
howard Smooth.
raj Thank you.
gablehouser There's the man of the hour.
leonard Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.
howard All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.
leonard Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
raj We need a social catalyst.
leonard Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
howard Or can we?
leonard No, we can't.
howard I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't.
sheldon Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me.
leonard Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.
raj Okay. How about that one.
howard Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.
raj Are you crying?
howard No, I have allergies.
raj Okay, uh, how about her?
leonard Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.
raj Okay, so not her either. How about her?
howard Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.
leonard I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
raj I can't talk to her, you do it.
leonard I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.
howard Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.
raj You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done.
leonard Well, we're not in India.
raj Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
leonard Okay, that was uncalled for.
raj You started it, dude.
gablehouser Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
sheldon Welcome Dennis Kim.
gablehouser Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.
sheldon Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
gablehouser And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!
dennis What?
gablehouser Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.
dennis Um, no thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma.
gablehouser Well, uh, well, uh ...
leonard The kid got a girl.
raj Unbelievable.
howard Did anyone see how he did it?
sheldon Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honored daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.
howard He's back.
leonard Yeah, mission accomplished.
raj Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
howard I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.
leonard Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart.
raj Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting.
howard Yeah, let's go with that.
howard Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.
leonard I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman 'you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.'
raj Hey, look at that. It's Dennis Kim.
howard Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.
raj You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.
leonard Yeah, we really ruined his life.
sheldon Screw him, he was weak.
