raj_koothrappali So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.
raj_koothrappali No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re sorry, Rajesh.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe we can do it next week.
howard_wolowitz Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.
raj_koothrappali Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
howard_wolowitz Hallelujah.
raj_koothrappali Because I’ve got something even better planned.
leonard_hofstadter Aw.
howard_wolowitz Why?
sheldon_cooper Come on.
raj_koothrappali Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.
leonard_hofstadter We did them at Princeton, too.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.
sheldon_cooper That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.
amy_farrah_fowler Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.
penny I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…
howard_wolowitz And Princeton.
leonard_hofstadter A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.
penny Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.
raj_koothrappali So, uh, who’s in?
leonard_hofstadter I think it sounds fun.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, me, too.
various#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 I’m in, let’s do it.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
leonard_hofstadter What’s all this?
sheldon_cooper Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.
leonard_hofstadter You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
sheldon_cooper Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.
raj_koothrappali Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
sheldon_cooper He is a born showman.
raj_koothrappali Any questions?
howard_wolowitz Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not funny.
sheldon_cooper No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.
leonard_hofstadter Ha-ha.
sheldon_cooper Oh, see? Now he gets it.
raj_koothrappali Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
bernadette_rostenkowski Should we just do couples?
leonard_hofstadter Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
penny Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.
leonard_hofstadter I just said, couples sound great.
penny Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.
penny No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!
sheldon_cooper Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?
amy_farrah_fowler Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
penny Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
penny All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.
sheldon_cooper Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.
raj_koothrappali All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
penny Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.
howard_wolowitz Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.
amy_farrah_fowler I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.
howard_wolowitz If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.
howard_wolowitz Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
howard_wolowitz Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
bernadette_rostenkowski Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!
leonard_hofstadter Stop yelling at me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.
penny Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.
sheldon_cooper But we haven’t finished the puzzle.
penny But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.
sheldon_cooper You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?
penny Okay, it’s not gonna say that.
sheldon_cooper Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.
howard_wolowitz It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.
penny It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.
sheldon_cooper It’s the comic book store.
leonard_hofstadter Do you think Penny’s mad at me?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.
leonard_hofstadter No, because I didn’t want her on my team.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
leonard_hofstadter Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?
amy_farrah_fowler I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.
howard_wolowitz Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.
amy_farrah_fowler Such as?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…
howard_wolowitz Hey, how about some music?
amy_farrah_fowler Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.
howard_wolowitz Find something you like.
amy_farrah_fowler Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.
amy_farrah_fowler I love Neil Diamond.
both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…
raj_koothrappali Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.
stuart_bloom Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.
raj_koothrappali Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.
raj_koothrappali Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
bernadette_rostenkowski Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.
leonard_hofstadter I have asthma. Back off.
howard_wolowitz Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.
raj_koothrappali Good riddle, huh?
stuart_bloom Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?
raj_koothrappali I invited you to my murder mystery party.
stuart_bloom No, you didn’t.
raj_koothrappali Oh.
penny Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.
sheldon_cooper It is a marathon, not a sprint.
penny People run in a marathon.
sheldon_cooper Not with a bowling ball on their back.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.
leonard_hofstadter Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.
penny Riddle me this…
sheldon_cooper Got it.
penny Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
sheldon_cooper I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
howard_wolowitz Hey, you know what this could mean .
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be
howard_wolowitz That’s it.
amy_farrah_fowler To the Neil Mobile.
bernadette_rostenkowski I knew it, we’re gonna lose.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, I got it. I got it/
bernadette_rostenkowski Congratulations, you got it last.
leonard_hofstadter You’re really mean, you know that?
stuart_bloom So no one’s gonna buy anything.
penny Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.
sheldon_cooper The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
penny Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?
sheldon_cooper Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.
penny Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
sheldon_cooper And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…
penny Shut up. I solved it.
sheldon_cooper Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.
penny Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?
sheldon_cooper No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.
howard_wolowitz On the boats and on the planes.
amy_farrah_fowler They’re coming to America.
howard_wolowitz Never looking back again.
amy_farrah_fowler They’re coming to America… ♪
leonard_hofstadter Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix things.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Like death?
bernadette_rostenkowski Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s not answering my texts.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who cares? Focus on the game.
leonard_hofstadter This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.
bernadette_rostenkowski No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.
leonard_hofstadter What does she think I am?
bernadette_rostenkowski How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe she would say that about me.
bernadette_rostenkowski If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.

sheldon_cooper Okay, another 30 feet.
penny Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley.
sheldon_cooper Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody’s.
howard_wolowitz Love on the rocks.
amy_farrah_fowler Ain’t no big surprise.
howard_wolowitz Just pour me a drink.
amy_farrah_fowler And I’ll tell you some lies.
leonard_hofstadter Call me a lady part. We’ll see about that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Can you reach the clue?
leonard_hofstadter Almost.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.
leonard_hofstadter Got it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great, climb back up. Come on.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Penny might be onto something.
sheldon_cooper To the planetarium.
penny Let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter To the tar pits.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler There’s a Neil Diamond concert next month.
howard_wolowitz Let’s go.
penny Three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones here.
sheldon_cooper It’s dirty laundry. You’re up.
penny What? Why me?
sheldon_cooper Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
bernadette_rostenkowski They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
penny Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
leonard_hofstadter The clue must be in the bag.
penny It’s just a bunch of pants.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just a bunch of pants.
penny You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team.
leonard_hofstadter Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon.
penny What are you talking about?
leonard_hofstadter You know exactly what I’m talking about.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, she doesn’t. I just made that up.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you do that?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.
sheldon_cooper I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.
penny Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wish I had a man like her on my team.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this.
sheldon_cooper Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt.
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper Hey, that’s my shirt.
leonard_hofstadter This one is, too.
sheldon_cooper No, no, that’s not mine. It has a big spot on it.
penny But wait. So does this one.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe the spot’s the clue.
penny Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s clever.
penny Hurry.
sheldon_cooper Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.
bernadette_rostenkowski Stop her, Leonard, stop her.
penny Well, where the hell’s the coin?
leonard_hofstadter Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.
bernadette_rostenkowski Then where’s the coin?
raj_koothrappali Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
penny I don’t get it.
raj_koothrappali Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner.
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me?
penny That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
bernadette_rostenkowski You suck so hard.
raj_koothrappali Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.
penny Run.
raj_koothrappali Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.
penny Run to India.
raj_koothrappali I just wanted to do something beautiful.
sheldon_cooper Hey, look. I won.
howard_wolowitz Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,
