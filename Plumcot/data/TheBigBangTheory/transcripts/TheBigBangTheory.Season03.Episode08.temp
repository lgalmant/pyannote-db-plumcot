howard How much time do we have?
leonard Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.
raj Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.
howard Anything yet?
leonard Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock.
howard Hang on, how about now?
raj We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
howard Ooh, Real Sex.
raj Big deal. Every time I watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
howard Alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed.
leonard Oh, hey. Dune.
raj Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.
leonard Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.
raj Yes, it’s not the same without him.
howard Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex.
sheldon Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship.
sheldon And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.
penny Sheldon help!
sheldon I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. Penny. Penny. Penny..
penny Come in! Hurry!
sheldon Penny?
penny I’m back here.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny..
penny Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!
sheldon Shall I come back at a better time?
penny Get in here! Hurry! Don’t you dare knock.
sheldon Hello.
penny I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.
sheldon Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
penny What?
sheldon Tubs are slippery.
penny I know. I slipped.
sheldon I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
penny Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
sheldon They’re holding umbrellas.
penny What?
sheldon The ducks in my tub.
penny Uh-huh.
sheldon They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.
penny Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.
sheldon Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.
penny Okay, can you drive me?
sheldon I don’t drive.
penny Well, I can’t drive!
sheldon Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse.
penny Ow.
sheldon But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
penny No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please.
sheldon All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
penny No one’s saying that. Let’s go.
sheldon Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.
leonard I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping.
raj Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.
howard Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.
raj Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?
howard Oh I don’t know, 50, 55.
raj Oh, menopause, nature’s birth control.
leonard Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up.
howard I am.
raj Yeah, me, too.
howard Look, they gave me homemade cookies.
leonard Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do.
raj So, what are we waiting for?
howard Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap.
raj Good idea. They’ll be refreshed.
howard Cookie?
raj Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.
leonard Mmmm, not bad.
raj Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.
howard Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.
raj Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.
sheldon I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
penny I don’t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.
sheldon My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
penny One was already in an accident.
sheldon That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving.
penny Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!
sheldon Okay, here.
penny Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
sheldon All right.
penny No… No… Oh, that’s cute.
sheldon We should have you checked for a concussion.
penny Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.
sheldon All right.
penny But don’t look.
sheldon Don’t look?
penny I don’t want you to see me naked.
sheldon Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.
penny Yeah, great.
sheldon They always look. It never ends well.
penny Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.
sheldon Ok.
penny Is that my arm?
sheldon It doesn’t feel like an arm.
penny Then, maybe you should let it go.
sheldon All righty.
leonard Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
howard Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.
raj That’s beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it.
howard So, when do the meteors get here?
raj The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path.
leonard I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.
raj Okay, how’s that?
leonard Better. Thanks.
howard Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
leonard What’s so funny?
raj It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid. Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
sheldon For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.
penny You have your learner’s permit, right?
sheldon Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.
penny Good.
sheldon Didn’t work out well.
penny All right, can we please go?
sheldon One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?
penny It’s right there.
sheldon Where is the passenger side mirror?
penny In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?
sheldon Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again.
raj If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.
leonard I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
howard I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
raj I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
leonard You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
howard It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.
raj One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.
leonard People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?
howard To this day, I can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.
penny Could you please drive a little faster?
sheldon Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?
penny Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
sheldon That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.
penny No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
sheldon All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
penny It’s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
sheldon Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.
penny Oh, god, I’m gonna lose the arm.
sheldon Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
penny What?
sheldon Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
penny It’s not soup, it’s courage.
sheldon No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.
penny How did you see it? You said you wouldn’t look.
sheldon Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.
howard Anything?
leonard No. That was the last pudding cup.
howard No! What about Slim Jims?
leonard That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
raj Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
howard Wait. Wait, wait. So you’re saying we’re out of food?
leonard The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
raj I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.
leonard Oh, god, I am so hungry.
howard Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.
leonard Okay.
sheldon All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.
penny I dislocated my shoulder.
sheldon All right. And how did the accident occur?
penny You ready know that.
sheldon Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
penny No.
sheldon Kidney disease?
penny No.
sheldon Migraines?
penny Getting one.
sheldon Are you currently pregnant?
penny No.
sheldon Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
penny Change migraine to yes.
sheldon When was your last menstrual period?
penny Oh, next question.
sheldon I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.
penny Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
sheldon Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
penny Ass.
sheldon Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.
penny Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?
sheldon I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here.
penny Thanks. That’s much better.
raj Oh, I’m so hungry!
leonard Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.
howard Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.
leonard What kind of score are we looking at?
howard Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11.
leonard All right, everyone grab flashlights.
howard Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.
leonard Quick, get forks.
howard You don’t need forks. It’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands.
raj He’s right.
leonard I feel like we’re forgetting something important.
raj Me, too. But what?
howard Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
leonard_and_raj_together Yes! Yes!
sheldon Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.
penny Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I’d say that.
sheldon Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
penny You know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.
sheldon That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.
penny Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.
sheldon “Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.
penny Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
sheldon Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
penny Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I’ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty… little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
raj …And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin.
howard That’s still not funny.
raj That’s still not funny.
howard And she was my second cousin.
raj And she was my second cousin.
howard You’re a real douche.
raj Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
