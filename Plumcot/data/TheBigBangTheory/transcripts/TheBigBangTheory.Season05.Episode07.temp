sheldon And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.
ghostly_voice Sheldon, Sheldon.
sheldon Hmm. All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.
ghostly_voice Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
raj You should’ve seen your face.
sheldon Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.
howard Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.
sheldon Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me.
raj He’s probably right.
howard We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.
sheldon Gentlemen. .
howard Who had money on faints?
raj I had pee his pants.
leonard Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
leonard Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
sheldon Droll.
leonard That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
sheldon Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.
stuart Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!
raj What is she doing in a comic book store?
stuart I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.
hot_girl Hi.
stuart Um… it-it-it… Shut up.
hot_girl Are you getting this Next Men?
leonard Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
hot_girl I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.
leonard Sorry.
hot_girl Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?
leonard Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.
hot_girl Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.
leonard Leonard.
alice You are very cute, Leonard.
leonard Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.
alice No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?
leonard Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.
alice Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.
leonard Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?
alice Alice.
leonard Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.
alice Later.
howard Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
stuart ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.
leonard No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.
stuart Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend.
sheldon Be sure to check the mail.
leonard How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
sheldon Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
leonard Right.
penny Hey, guys.
leonard More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
penny Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
sheldon Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.
leonard Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
sheldon Open the mail!
leonard Excuse me. A couple of circulars, nothing important.
penny What’s with him?
leonard Hang on. You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.
leonard Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
alice What are you wearing?
leonard Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.
alice Wow, you must have gotten so laid.
leonard No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
alice Want to see a comic I draw?
leonard You’re kidding. You have your own book?
alice Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.
leonard Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
alice You’d think, but no.
leonard You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do…
alice So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?
leonard You can have my car.
sheldon Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.
raj Good morning, Sheldon.
sheldon It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.
raj You have a thing of paper clips right there.
sheldon well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
raj I don’t know. Maybe.
sheldon Be a lamb and check.
raj All right. Who do we have here?
sheldon It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
raj Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
sheldon Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
raj Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
sheldon I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.
penny It’s open.
leonard Hey, you got a minute?
penny Yeah, sure, come on in.
leonard Thanks.
penny Want some mac and cheese?
leonard No. Lactose. Gas.
penny Glass of wine?
leonard No. Sulfites. Migraines.
penny Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?
leonard Okay, we used to go out, right?
penny Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.
leonard I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.
penny All right, what’s going on?
leonard So, you’re okay talking about this?
penny Yes.
leonard You’re sure it’s not weird.
penny It’s okay.
leonard You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.
penny Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.
leonard Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
penny Yeah, probably.
leonard Come on.
penny I’m sorry, go ahead.
leonard I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.
penny Did you guys do it?
leonard No. We just made out a little.
penny Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
leonard Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
penny That’s gross.
leonard Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
penny Well, good for you.
leonard The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.
penny So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
leonard Oh, that’s not who I am.
penny All right, then break it off with the new girl.
leonard Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.
penny If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?
leonard Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
penny Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.
leonard Now we’re getting somewhere.
penny What does your gut tell you?
leonard Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
sheldon Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. Perfect.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon Science. You wouldn’t understand.
leonard Hey, well, see you. I’m going out.
sheldon I thought you were leaving the apartment.
leonard Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind.
sheldon Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
leonard No. I’m having a moral crisis.
sheldon Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
leonard Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.
sheldon All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.
leonard Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
sheldon You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.
leonard That actually does help.
sheldon It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
leonard Screw it, I’m going.
sheldon On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
leonard Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
sheldon Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
leonard No.
sheldon Great. Tropicana, no pulp.
howard Hey, Sheldon.
bernadette Who is it?
sheldon It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.
howard That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.
sheldon Really? That’s very unsettling.
bernadette Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon Hi.
howard What’s up?
sheldon It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.
howard Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?
sheldon Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
howard Whatever. My… oh… it’s…
bernadette Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
sheldon It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
bernadette Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
sheldon Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
bernadette This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.
sheldon We are?
bernadette You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.
sheldon Oh, no! I can’t!
bernadette Hurry! We’re running out of time!
sheldon Okay.
bernadette Just do it!
sheldon Oh, God! One, two, three!
howard Trick or treat, bubbeleh.
sheldon What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… .
leonard Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this.
alice Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on.
leonard No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to.
alice But?
leonard But I kind of have a girlfriend.
alice Are you kidding?
leonard You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?
alice I don’t believe this.
leonard Wait, I don’t, which part?
alice I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass.
leonard Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.
leonard It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
leonard Hey, Priya.
priya Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?
leonard Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
priya Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?
leonard Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.
priya Leonard, relax. It’s okay.
leonard It is?
priya Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.
leonard Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?
priya Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.
leonard Uh, kind of?
priya A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
leonard No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
priya Well, it’s not a competition.
leonard Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this.
sheldon Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even.
