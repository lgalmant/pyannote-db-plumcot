sheldon_cooper Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
amy_farrah_fowler Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?
sheldon_cooper Vexillology is the study of flags.
amy_farrah_fowler Cool. I think I just learned something.
sheldon_cooper Did you have fun doing it?
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll say.
sheldon_cooper Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.
amy_farrah_fowler Sweet!
sheldon_cooper Why are you waving a white flag?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m surrendering to fun.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.
sheldon_cooper Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
sheldon_cooper And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
amy_farrah_fowler You okay?
sheldon_cooper No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
amy_farrah_fowler Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?
sheldon_cooper Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
sheldon_cooper Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top.
penny That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.
leonard_hofstadter Me, too, I missed you.
penny You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?
penny I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.
penny Okay, well, maybe not that slow.
leonard_hofstadter How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?
penny You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.
leonard_hofstadter Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.
penny You mean like a beta test?
leonard_hofstadter Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…
penny Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
leonard_hofstadter No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.
penny All right. Let’s give it a shot.
leonard_hofstadter Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange.
penny Okay. Good night, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back.
sheldon_cooper Cut! Take 47.
sheldon_cooper Here’s an interesting fact about flags.
raj_koothrappali I will take that action.
sheldon_cooper The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.
howard_wolowitz Let’s see the new phone.
raj_koothrappali I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?
howard_wolowitz Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part.
raj_koothrappali Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.
howard_wolowitz Oh, let me try the voice recognition.
raj_koothrappali Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy. Hello?
phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 Hello.
raj_koothrappali What’s your name?
phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 My name is Siri.
howard_wolowitz Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
raj_koothrappali Are you single?
siri I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?
siri I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.
raj_koothrappali I will see you gentlemen later.
howard_wolowitz She is gonna break his heart.
amy_farrah_fowler For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.
sheldon_cooper Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con.
penny Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?
leonard_hofstadter Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.
leonard_hofstadter Even Doctor Who?
penny Even Doctor Who.
sheldon_cooper All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.
penny Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.
penny What’s this?
leonard_hofstadter My bug report to you.
penny Well, that’s quite a list you got there.
leonard_hofstadter It’s colour coded.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?
penny Yep.
leonard_hofstadter So, have a good night.
penny Yep.
leonard_hofstadter Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
sheldon_cooper How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
amy_farrah_fowler Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth.
raj_koothrappali So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?
siri I am well.
raj_koothrappali What are you doing right now?
siri What am I doing? I’m talking with you.
raj_koothrappali You have a beautiful voice.
siri Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated.
raj_koothrappali I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
siri Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”
raj_koothrappali No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?
siri My name is Siri.
raj_koothrappali Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.
siri Would you like me to call you Raj?
raj_koothrappali I’d like you to call me sexy.
siri From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?
raj_koothrappali Okay.
siri I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.
raj_koothrappali Thank you, darling.
siri You are most certainly welcome, sexy.
sheldon_cooper Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
raj_koothrappali I haven’t bonded with it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me.
raj_koothrappali It’s just a phone.
barry_kripke Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Kripke.
barry_kripke Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck.
raj_koothrappali Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.
siri All right, I’ll remind you.
barry_kripke You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?
barrys_siri#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant.
barry_kripke Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.
barrys_siri#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.
barry_kripke See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.
raj_koothrappali Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.
barry_kripke Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.
penny It’s open.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. You ready to go?
penny Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
leonard_hofstadter Can you finish it later?
penny No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
penny Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
leonard_hofstadter They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.
penny All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.
leonard_hofstadter All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.
raj_koothrappali Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
howard_wolowitz Great.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, smells amazing in here.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, what are we eating?
raj_koothrappali Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
howard_wolowitz Yes. His phone.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
howard_wolowitz Uh-huh.
raj_koothrappali Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.
siri Playing smooth jazz.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know if I want to stay.
penny This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
leonard_hofstadter I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
penny Okay, you’re kind of really great.
leonard_hofstadter You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
penny Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Sorry, sorry.
penny And stop apologizing all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Sorry.
penny All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?
leonard_hofstadter I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
penny Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.
leonard_hofstadter So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.
penny No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
leonard_hofstadter Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
penny Well, thank you for a really cool evening.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
penny Things are looking good.
leonard_hofstadter So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have.
penny Good night, you.
sheldon_cooper Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.
amy_farrah_fowler Und ich bin eine pretzel!
sheldon_cooper Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
amy_farrah_fowler Mit…
sheldon_cooper Flags.
receptionist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 First door on the left.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
siri Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me. I’m sorry. I don’t understand.
raj_koothrappali No!
