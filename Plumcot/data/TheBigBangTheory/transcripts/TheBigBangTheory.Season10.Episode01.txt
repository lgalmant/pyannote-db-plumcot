sheldon_cooper Leonard? Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper You realize you and I could become brothers.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
sheldon_cooper I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
leonard_hofstadter Go to sleep.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
penny Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
sheldon_cooper Very well.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
penny God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
sheldon_cooper Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.
penny Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, drive safe.
penny Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
sheldon_cooper It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
penny What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Penny, wait.
penny Why?
dr_beverly_hofstadter I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
leonard_hofstadter Well, why? What’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?
dr_beverly_hofstadter I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Stop it, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?
dr_beverly_hofstadter I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
sheldon_cooper Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.
penny Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
sheldon_cooper And turned their phones off.
leonard_hofstadter Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
penny Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, we can’t have that.
sheldon_cooper You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
raj_koothrappali It is funny when you think about it.
howard_wolowitz Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
bernadette_rostenkowski Because you were driving like a lunatic.
howard_wolowitz Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I’ll get it.
bernadette_rostenkowski It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
howard_wolowitz I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz.
raj_koothrappali Howard Wolowitz?
air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 I have the right address, don’t I?
raj_koothrappali Address?
air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 Is he here?
raj_koothrappali Um, no.
air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 Do you know where I can find him?
raj_koothrappali May I ask what this is about?
air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 No, you may not.
raj_koothrappali Very well.
air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 Have him call me.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
howard_wolowitz Raj, who’s at the door?
raj_koothrappali That’s not him.
penny Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
susan Like what? Do they know about your brother?
penny Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
susan Why would you do that?
penny What?
susan The world doesn’t need to know our problems.
penny Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…
wyatt Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.
susan You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?
wyatt Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.
susan Well, quit it.
penny So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
randall Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state.
susan All right, that’s enough jail talk.
randall Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.
susan You sent your brother cigarettes?
wyatt He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.
susan Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.
wyatt Anyway, we’re here, slugger.
howard_wolowitz That’s great, now they know where I live.
raj_koothrappali What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.
raj_koothrappali Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
howard_wolowitz All right, all right.
raj_koothrappali Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
howard_wolowitz Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.
howard_wolowitz Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?
raj_koothrappali That’s what he said to me.
leonard_hofstadter Here you are, Mother.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I can’t wait for this day to be over.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, special, like that. That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.
sheldon_cooper All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys, come on in.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, thank you.
mary_cooper Good morning.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Morning.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
dr_alfred_hofstadter How is everyone today?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Good, and you?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Good, good.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Good.
mary_cooper I’m good, too.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Good.
sheldon_cooper So, did you defile my mother or not?
mary_cooper Sheldon. You’re being rude.
dr_alfred_hofstadter If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.
sheldon_cooper Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
mary_cooper That’s enough.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
sheldon_cooper Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
penny All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
randall You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard.
wyatt Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.
susan Not funny, Wyatt.
penny I thought it was really funny.
wyatt Thanks.
susan Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment.
randall That’s not much of a joke.
penny Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
susan Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.
randall Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?
mary_cooper How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?
sheldon_cooper A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
leonard_hofstadter Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.
mary_cooper Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Maybe we meet halfway.
sheldon_cooper What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
dr_beverly_hofstadter You’re not seriously going to visit each other.
dr_alfred_hofstadter And why wouldn’t we?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus.
leonard_hofstadter Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.
mary_cooper No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.
sheldon_cooper What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
leonard_hofstadter Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
sheldon_cooper Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
sheldon_cooper But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
leonard_hofstadter Fine, then you go.
mary_cooper Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go.
dr_alfred_hofstadter I’ll go with you.
leonard_hofstadter That still leaves me here with him.
amy_farrah_fowler Who’s ready for a wedding?
sheldon_cooper Great, now I have to start all over.
wyatt So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
penny Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
susan See what happens when you work hard?
randall Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em.
susan Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.
wyatt I’ll drink to that.
susan Haven’t you had enough?
wyatt Penny drinks more than I do.
penny Well, I learned from the best.
wyatt Aw.
penny Aw.
susan Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.
randall You see what I’ve gotta put up with.
susan What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
randall It’s called getting caught, Mother.
leonard_hofstadter Hello.
wyatt Hey, there he is.
penny Hey.
susan Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello.
susan Hi.
randall We are not white trash.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused.
mary_cooper Oh, so am I.
sheldon_cooper You made God sad today, Mom.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.
amy_farrah_fowler It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
dr_alfred_hofstadter You’re a patient young lady.
sheldon_cooper Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.
howard_wolowitz Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
raj_koothrappali Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
howard_wolowitz That’s really stupid advice.
raj_koothrappali You know that hurts my feelings.
howard_wolowitz Calm down, try not to think about it.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
howard_wolowitz Why do I bother talking to you?
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?
raj_koothrappali Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.
howard_wolowitz What’s the point of that story?
raj_koothrappali I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
dr_beverly_hofstadter So, what do you do for a living?
randall Mommy, you want to take this one?
susan Um, Randall’s in between jobs.
randall And court appearances.
wyatt It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Prepare to be disappointed.
leonard_hofstadter And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?
wyatt Well, I could use another beer.
susan You’re done. He’s done.
penny Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
randall Not at all.
stuart_bloom Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Nice to see you, too.
stuart_bloom Hi, I’m Stuart.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father.
stuart_bloom Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 No.
stuart_bloom I was wondering why the front row was available.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I think we’re ready.
sheldon_cooper Why do people cry at weddings?
mary_cooper They’re practicing for what’s coming later.
susan Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.
randall Thank you for my new teeth.
wyatt Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money.
bernadette_rostenkowski We’re here today to celebrate love.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Urgh.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Sigh louder, no one heard you.
stuart_bloom Really, I can move.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
sheldon_cooper Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.
howard_wolowitz At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
penny Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t
penny Oh.
bernadette_rostenkowski Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
dr_alfred_hofstadter I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I couldn’t agree more.
stuart_bloom That’s beautiful.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you. All right, let’s continue.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s happening.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Thank you for taking us to the airport.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that.
leonard_hofstadter That’s okay. I can make it over.
dr_beverly_hofstadter No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable.
dr_alfred_hofstadter What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Do the world a favour, and don’t wake up tomorrow morning.
leonard_hofstadter That was almost a minute.
mary_cooper There’s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?
amy_farrah_fowler You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
mary_cooper Good. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
mary_cooper Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
sheldon_cooper Yes ma’am.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.
sheldon_cooper Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.
amy_farrah_fowler I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
sheldon_cooper What, you’re not my mother.
mary_cooper Don’t you be disrespectful to her.
sheldon_cooper Yes ma’am.
mary_cooper You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it.
susan Penny, I don’t know what I was worried about. You’re friends are just lovely.
penny Oh, thanks, Mom.
susan Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.
penny Is he? I never noticed.
wyatt He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.
randall Cops, cops, be cool.
