howard I’m thinking about growing a goatee.
raj Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
leonard Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?
raj You mean a moo-stache?
leonard Moo-stache.
howard He said it.
raj Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.
howard Say what?
raj Moo-stache.
leonard Moo-stache.
howard He said it.
bernadette Guys, you’re being childish.
sheldon Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.
amy Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.
penny Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.
leonard Oh, I’m sorry.
sheldon You’ll get ’em next time.
penny How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?
leonard Sorry. How did it go?
penny Just shut up.
raj Here, you can have your seat.
penny No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.
bernadette Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
amy Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
raj Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.
sheldon No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.
leonard I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea.
penny Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
sheldon Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
howard Hey, how come we never get that option?
sheldon Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.
penny Translation?
leonard Waah. I don’t want a table.
leonard Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?
sheldon You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.
leonard Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?
sheldon I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.
leonard Are you really gonna sit here all day?
sheldon Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.
leonard If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.
sheldon It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.
leonard I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.
sheldon You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.
leonard Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.
sheldon Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
leonard Huh?
sheldon But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats.
leonard Nary an argument? Nary?
sheldon Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset.
howard Check it out.
raj Magic wand TV remote?
howard Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.
raj Did Bernadette think it was cool?
howard Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.
raj Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.
howard Well, that’s the last time I play with that. I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137
raj Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
howard Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna believe this.
raj What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?
howard That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.
raj Wow. What did you tell them?
howard I told them I’d be honoured.
raj A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.
howard And I’m gonna miss you, too.
raj And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.
howard Thank you.
raj And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.
penny Ooh, this one looks nice.
leonard No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
penny Why not?
leonard He’s afraid the original owners will come back.
penny Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.
leonard Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it.
penny All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too.
leonard I know, but…
penny No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
leonard You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.
penny See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time.
leonard You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.
penny Really? This one?
leonard That one? Damn right I like that one.
bernadette Hey.
howard Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
bernadette Fine. Can I at least shower first?
howard No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.
bernadette What are you talking about?
howard Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.
bernadette Wow. Well, what did you say?
howard What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?
bernadette Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d ever want to go back.
howard Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.
bernadette Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
howard I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
leonard Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.
sheldon My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.
penny Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.
sheldon You’re absolutely right. Nope.
penny Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.
sheldon So, when can we get rid of it?
leonard We’re not.
sheldon What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.
penny Come on, that is ridiculous.
leonard She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often.
penny That’s not what I’m saying.
leonard Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
penny Yes.
leonard That.
sheldon Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.
penny Me?
leonard Well, it’s always me, take one for the team.
sheldon I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.
penny Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
leonard Fancy sounds like a compliment.
penny Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.
sheldon That’s not true.
penny Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.
sheldon She told you?
penny Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.
leonard You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.
sheldon You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.
leonard Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.
sheldon No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death.
penny Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
leonard Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.
sheldon Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
penny Oh, Sheldon, wait.
sheldon No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.
leonard Well, we should call her.
penny Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.
sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get AppleCare.
amy I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?
sheldon At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this.
amy Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
sheldon It doesn’t?
amy Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.
sheldon Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?
amy All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?
sheldon It is hideous.
amy Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.
sheldon Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
amy Of course I was.
sheldon Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
amy I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it.
sheldon How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
amy I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.
sheldon Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.
raj It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
bermadette Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?
raj Course.
bernadette He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?
raj Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.
bernadette So you’ll talk to him?
raj Why me?
bernadette Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him.
raj That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill.
bernadette Since when am I the buzzkill?
raj Do you think this is cool?
bernadette No, I think it’s stupid.
raj Aha.
bernadette You’re right, it’s great.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up.
sheldon No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.
amy Which you also figured out by yourself.
sheldon Which I also figured out by myself.
penny Well, I’m glad you’re still together.
sheldon Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.
amy Which is stronger than ever.
sheldon Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.
howard But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.
sheldon Um.
amy You don’t need to explain yourself to him.
sheldon I don’t need to explain myself to you!
amy You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
sheldon Keep the table. We don’t use that space.
amy Damn it, I got cocky.
howard Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello.
bernadette Hi, honey.
howard What’s going on?
bernadette Maybe you should have a seat.
howard Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons.
raj Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.
mike_rostenkowski Well, I wouldn’t…
bernadette Daddy.
mike_r You’re great.
mike_massimino Can I say something?
raj Oh, of course.
mike_m Hey, Fruit Loops.
howard Massimino? Why are you here?
mike_m Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who’s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?
howard Sure.
mike_m The stuff you have is wrong.
howard You don’t think I did a good job up there?
mike_m You did a fine job. It’s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.
bernadette I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.
raj Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
mike_r Like a woman. Great analogy.
howard Fine, maybe I was a little scared.
mike_m You peed in your space suit.
howard You’re supposed to do that.
mike_m Not during the fitting.
mike_r Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?
howard Hang on. That was just me joking around.
mike_r You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.
howard Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.
bernadette Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
raj And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.
mike_m That was funny.
howard Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.
mike_m You know you’re gonna have to go through survival training again.
howard Really?
howard You’ve got to get me out of this.
doctor What do you want me to do? You’re perfectly healthy.
howard Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.
mrs_wolowitz Hello?
howard Hi, Ma. How are you?
mrs_wolowitz How I am is not dead, but you wouldn’t know that, because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone.
howard Go, go, go.
mrs_wolowitz For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That’s what happened to your Aunt Ida.
doctor Wow.
raj Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.
howard Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.
leonard But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
howard Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.
penny You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…
howard Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.
penny Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?
bernadette Yeah, it’s fun up here.
leonard So why are you trying to ruin it?
sheldon No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad.
bernadette Now I feel bad.
leonard Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.
bernadette No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.
leonard Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.
bernadette Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
penny Yeah, let’s go.
leonard But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.
penny Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.
leonard Fine.
amy Rajesh?
raj Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.
bernadette Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.
raj Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
howard You mean tings like moo-stache?
sheldon Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
