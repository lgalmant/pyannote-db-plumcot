sheldon All right, I’m ready for my next question.
amy In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?
sheldon Uganda.
amy Defend.
sheldon Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.
amy Correct. My turn.
sheldon In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?
amy Tuned bayonets.
sheldon Defend.
amy Isn’t it obvious?
sheldon You’re right. My apologies.
leonard What the hell are you guys playing?
sheldon It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
amy We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
sheldon It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
leonard All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
sheldon You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?
leonard Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.
sheldon Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here.
leonard I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon.
sheldon Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.
leonard What?
amy In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
leonard This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
amy Is he always like this when he loses?
sheldon Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.
leonard You bumped the table and you know it.
amy Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
leonard I’m going to my room.
amy Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding.
leonard Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
raj Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
leonard What?
raj Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
howard On the potty? What are you, five?
raj It’s a potty. What do you call it?
howard Toilet.
raj That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?
howard Oh, and potty is okay?
raj Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
howard What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?
raj If I don’t have to boom-boom.
sheldon Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
leonard Sure.
howard Nice to see you.
amy Hello.
sheldon Sorry we’re late.
amy I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
howard Ah, ah.
leonard Okay.
sheldon I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
amy Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.
leonard Ah, ah.
howard Okay. Toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?
penny Hey, look, it’s Shamy.
amy Shamy?
sheldon A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy, Shamy.
amy Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.
penny All righty. What’s new?
amy Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that.
penny I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how’s your life?
amy Like everybody else’s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?
sheldon I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.
amy Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
sheldon It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
penny Okay, I’m just gonna walk away, ’cause I don’t want to be here.
leonard So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.
amy You’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat.
leonard Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up.
howard Um, tell us about your work, Amy.
amy I doubt you’d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
howard Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?
amy I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
sheldon They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
leonard Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?
sheldon She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.
leonard Got it.
sheldon Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day.
leonard Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.
sheldon Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man.
leonard Yeah, not my point.
sheldon I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up.
leonard Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
sheldon So?
leonard So we already have you for all that.
sheldon Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
leonard No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
sheldon May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.
leonard Suffered in silence?
sheldon Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
leonard Really? Silence?
raj Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?
howard Philadelphia.
raj Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
howard Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?
raj Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.
penny So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
raj I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?
penny Get one yourself.
raj Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.
penny God, he’s an ass when he drinks.
howard Oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. You just don’t hear it.
leonard I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
raj Well, if that’s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
penny I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
leonard I did.
penny Well, what’d he say?
leonard Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.
penny Kinda, sorta had to?
leonard I didn’t agree with him.
penny Well, you defended me, right?
leonard I tried, but he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
howard You’re not doing that right.
penny What?
howard Gimme.
penny No.
howard Trust me.
penny No!
howard I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
penny Wow, that is better.
howard And someday, when you have varicose veins, I’ll show you how to massage them.
raj Oh, God, never again.
leonard I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.
raj I was homesick.
howard The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills.
raj That’s very offensive.
howard Yeah, we all thought so.
leonard Oh, no.
howard What?
leonard John and Yoko.
howard More like Yoko and Yoko.
sheldon Greetings.
leonard Hey.
sheldon I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
amy It’s very impressive, for theoretical work.
sheldon Do I detect a hint of condescension?
amy I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute.
leonard_and_howard_together Oooh!
sheldon Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
amy I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
sheldon You take that back.
amy Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.
leonard I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…
sheldon Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.
amy Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.
sheldon That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!
amy We appear to have reached an impasse.
sheldon I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
amy Seconded.
sheldon There being no objections…
all No, uh-uh.
sheldon The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.
amy Good day, Sheldon Cooper.
howard Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses.
sheldon Amen to that.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello.
penny I hear you broke up with Amy.
sheldon A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
penny Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?
sheldon Regarding what?
penny Amy.
sheldon I don’t follow.
penny Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.
sheldon Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before.
penny Okay. Good.
sheldon Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat.
leonard I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon.
howard We’re all a little worried about Sheldon.
leonard No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.
howard Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I’m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.
raj What does hit a reef mean?
leonard Uh, went splitsville.
raj Pardon?
leonard Turned to boom-boom.
raj Ah.
leonard I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
howard You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
leonard He got a cat to keep him company.
raj You’re kidding.
leonard He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.
raj He takes the kitty to the potty?
howard I thought we discussed the P-word.
raj Don’t try to change me, dude. I am what I am.
sheldon Oh, gentlemen.
howard Hey. Aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
sheldon My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
howard Hello.
raj Hi.
sheldon Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.
howard Okay, I get it. We’re worried about Sheldon.
leonard Yeah.
leonard Hey. Oh, no.
sheldon Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
leonard So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
sheldon Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.
leonard Zazzles?
sheldon I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy.
leonard Okay, we need to talk.
sheldon About what?
leonard Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
sheldon Clowder.
leonard What?
sheldon A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
leonard Okay, yeah, fine.
sheldon It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
leonard Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
sheldon It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
leonard Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
sheldon You didn’t break up, she dumped you.
leonard She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
sheldon I was there. She dumped you.
leonard Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
sheldon You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all.
leonard Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.
mrs_cooper Where is he?
leonard He’s in his bedroom.
mrs_cooper Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?
leonard No, she’s real.
mrs_cooper Did they sin?
leonard No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.
mrs_cooper Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I’ve seen him at his best, I’ve seen him at his worst. There’s nothing he can do that’ll surprise me.
leonard Hold on to that thought.
sheldon Come in.
leonard Surprise.
sheldon Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.
mrs_cooper My, my, that’s a powerful smell.
sheldon I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…
mrs_cooper Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave ’em cute Jewish names.
sheldon What are you doing here?
mrs_cooper Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.
sheldon Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone.
mrs_cooper Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it’s creepy.
sheldon I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy.
mrs_cooper You should have called sooner.
mrs_cooper Shelly! Dinner’s ready!
sheldon Coming!
mrs_cooper No cats!
sheldon Aw. What is she doing here?
mrs_cooper I called her.
amy Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.
sheldon Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.
leonard 25 cats!
mrs_cooper Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let’s talk.
sheldon All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.
mrs_cooper Then stop talking.
sheldon Yes, ma’am.
mrs_cooper Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.
sheldon That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met.
mrs_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, Shelly, I can’t see it.
sheldon Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there.
amy Excellent point.
sheldon A physics point.
amy Touche.
mrs_cooper Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it’s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn’t have to end it for you.
sheldon Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.
amy I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
sheldon I’ll go as high as 40.
amy Sixty-five.
sheldon Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?
amy I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
sheldon Would you like to see my cats?
amy I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.
sheldon Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.
leonard I saw what you did there.
mrs_cooper He thinks he’s such a smarty pants. He’s no different from any man. You tell ’em not to do something, that’s all they want to do. If I hadn’t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we’d still be calling him Edward. Now, don’t you move. I’ll bring over all the food.
leonard No, no, no, I can do it.
mrs_cooper Well, isn’t that sweet?
sheldon Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.
amy Next!
sheldon Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.
amy Next!
