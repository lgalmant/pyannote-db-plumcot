leonard Okay, we’ve got power to the laser.
sheldon I should’ve brought an umbrella.
leonard What for? It’s not going to rain.
sheldon I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
howard That’s a bazinga, right?
sheldon One of my best, don’t you think?
leonard Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.
howard You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows.
raj It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy.
sheldon Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?
leonard Relax, it’s just a dirty sock.
sheldon How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
leonard Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
sheldon Not my world.
leonard Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
sheldon I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
raj Why don’t you ask her to come up?
leonard I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…
howard She dumped you?
leonard She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
sheldon I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
howard Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.
leonard Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
howard If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now.
raj Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.
penny Oh, hi. What’s going on?
leonard We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
penny I’m sorry, what?
leonard It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
man_in_pennys_apartment That makes no sense.
penny Um…
man How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There’s no gravity.
penny Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.
zack Hey.
leonard Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time.
penny Yeah, maybe.
zack Hey, I want to see this laser thing.
penny Oh, but what about the party?
zack It’s a surprise party, doesn’t matter when we get there.
penny Oh, right.
leonard Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?
zack My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.
leonard Your company?
zack Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.
leonard So, menus.
zack I know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them.
howard Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.
sheldon Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.
penny Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.
zack Hey.
sheldon Hello.
zack Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’.
sheldon Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.
zack Well, mission accomplished.
leonard Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
penny Oh! That’s very cool.
zack One question. How can you be sure it won’t blow up?
leonard The laser?
zack The moon.
sheldon See, now this is a man for Penny.
leonard Uh, that’s a great question, Zack.
sheldon No, it’s not.
penny Sheldon! Play nice.
sheldon Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
leonard Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.
zack Smart.
leonard Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
zack Naked.
leonard Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.
zack Cool, it’s gonna be in 3-D?
howard Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
sheldon Make it so.
howard There it is. There’s the spike!
leonard 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
zack That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?
leonard Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
zack What species is that?
sheldon I was wrong. Penny can do better.
penny Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun.
zack Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?
penny No, just keep walking.
sheldon He must be very skilled at coitus.
raj I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.
howard Horse.
raj What?
howard The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.
raj That’s disgusting, dude.
howard No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.
leonard No, thanks.
howard You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
leonard Have they found a match for you?
howard Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.
sheldon I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
leonard Why not?
sheldon All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to.
leonard I’ll help you.
sheldon Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.
raj You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
howard Yeah, right.
raj No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.
howard He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
raj Okay, we’ll call that plan B.
leonard Coming!
penny Damn you, you rat bastard.
leonard Are you drunk?
penny Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!
leonard How did I ruin him?
penny ‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid.
leonard Come on, he wasn’t that stupid.
penny Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!
leonard Okay, yeah, he’s stupid.
penny He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
leonard How is that my fault?
penny You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.
leonard Where are we going?
penny We’re gonna have sex.
leonard Why? I mean, okay.
sheldon What’s going on?
penny Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud.
sheldon Oh! Not this again.
sheldon In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.
penny What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?
sheldon When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?
penny Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry.
sheldon FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
penny Yeah, sorry about that.
sheldon As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.
penny Oh, God.
sheldon Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.
leonard How many times have I asked you not to do that?
sheldon Counting this instance? 317.
leonard Where’s Penny?
sheldon She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
leonard I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
sheldon Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
leonard I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
sheldon I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
leonard Oh, hey.
penny Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.
leonard Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?
penny Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
leonard Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
penny Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me.
leonard Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
penny Leonard, last night was a mistake.
leonard When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?
penny Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?
leonard No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
penny Oh, God!
leonard So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?
penny Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?
leonard How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
mrs_gunderson Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?
raj Holy crap.
howard What?
raj We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
howard Excuse me?
raj The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
howard You’re kidding. An actual woman?
raj Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.
howard Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman.
raj Since when?
howard I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.
leonard Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?
raj Do you know what he’s talking about?
howard Nope. Why don’t you ask him?
raj Leonard, what are you talking about?
leonard I don’t want to talk about it.
raj That was a lousy suggestion.
howard Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…
leonard If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. I can’t do it.
leslie_winkle Hello?
leonard Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.
leslie Leonard Hofstadter. What’re you doing here?
leonard Uh, I know! It’s been a while!
leslie Yeah, 18 months.
leonard Right. Right. So how you doing?
leslie Fine. You?
leonard Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?
leslie Yeah.
leonard Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?
leslie What happened? Blondie dumped you?
leonard She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
leslie Right.
leonard Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.
leslie Uh-huh.
leonard So, what do you say?
leslie Let me think about it.
leonard She’s not coming back.
raj Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
howard Not us. Him.
raj Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her.
howard Well, him about to find out about her.
raj Really? Us gonna tell him?
sheldon Who’s going to tell whom about what?
howard Sheldon. Hey.
raj Hi.
sheldon Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
howard Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?
sheldon Be more specific.
howard Four thirty.
sheldon That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
howard What?
sheldon It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
raj Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
sheldon Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
howard Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?
sheldon I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
raj But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
sheldon Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
howard And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”
raj Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.
howard Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?
sheldon Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.
raj Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
sheldon He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
howard Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.
sheldon I don’t drink coffee.
howard All right, you can have a hot chocolate.
sheldon As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
howard Why?
sheldon What’s life without whimsy?
howard Okay, I’m out.
raj Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
sheldon You’re bluffing.
raj Are you willing to risk it?
sheldon Curse you.
leonard Thirty feet.
penny Oh. Hey, Leonard.
leonard I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!
penny Are you drunk?
leonard Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!
penny Are you out of your mind?!
leonard I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
sheldon In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?
raj You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
sheldon Haughty derision it is.
amy Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
amy If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
sheldon Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
amy I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
sheldon Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
amy Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
sheldon May I buy you a beverage?
amy Tepid water, please.
howard Good God, what have we done?
