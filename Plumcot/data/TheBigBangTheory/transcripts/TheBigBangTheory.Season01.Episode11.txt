sheldon_cooper Checkmate.
leonard_hofstadter O-o-o-o-h! Again?
sheldon_cooper Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.
leonard_hofstadter Just reset the board.
sheldon_cooper It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
penny Hi guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey!
penny Did you get my mail.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?
penny Oh, better than North Dakota! I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.
sheldon_cooper From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
penny Boy, it's good to be back.
leonard_hofstadter How was your family?
penny Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.
sheldon_cooper Sick?
leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
sheldon_cooper What kind of sick?
penny Oh, the flu I guess.
sheldon_cooper I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?
penny Maybe Friday.
sheldon_cooper Friday, was that morning or afternoon?
penny I... I don't...
sheldon_cooper Think woman, who blew their nose and when?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.
sheldon_cooper Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe.
penny Oh, it's okay, I understand.
sheldon_cooper Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.
leonard_hofstadter You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
penny Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.
leonard_hofstadter No problem. Welcome home.
sheldon_cooper What?
leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
leonard_hofstadter With lime jello?
sheldon_cooper I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.
leonard_hofstadter I don't think so.
sheldon_cooper Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.
sheldon_cooper We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?
sheldon_cooper When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.
leonard_hofstadter I'm going back to bed.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Put this in the bathroom.
leonard_hofstadter What for?
sheldon_cooper I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
leonard_hofstadter I mix pancake batter in this!
sheldon_cooper No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.
leonard_hofstadter You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?
sheldon_cooper It's right here on the bottom.
leonard_hofstadter Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear God. Leonard! Leonard, I'm sick!
sheldon_cooper Leonard! Leonard I'm sick!
sheldon_cooper Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? Ow!
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, where are you?
leonard_hofstadter I'm at work.
sheldon_cooper At six-thirty in the morning?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper On Sunday?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Why?
leonard_hofstadter They asked me to come in.
sheldon_cooper Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
leonard_hofstadter They texted me.
sheldon_cooper Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.
leonard_hofstadter No kidding?
sheldon_cooper No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
sheldon_cooper What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
leonard_hofstadter Drink whatever you want.
sheldon_cooper I want soup.
leonard_hofstadter Then make soup.
sheldon_cooper We don't have soup.
leonard_hofstadter I'm at work, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Is that a dog?
leonard_hofstadter Yes,
sheldon_cooper In the lab?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, it's the phone.
howard_wolowitz I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.
debbie_wolowitz Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?
howard_wolowitz I don't know.
debbie_wolowitz Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.
howard_wolowitz How can I ask them when I'm talking to you! Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, it's Leonard, code Milky Green.
howard_wolowitz Dear Lord, not Milky Green!
leonard_hofstadter Affirmative, with fever.
debbie_wolowitz Who's on the phone.
howard_wolowitz It's Leonard.
debbie_wolowitz Why is he calling.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon's sick.
debbie_wolowitz Were you playing with him?
howard_wolowitz For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old.
debbie_wolowitz Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.
howard_wolowitz Chocolate milk and eggoes please!
leonard_hofstadter Howard, listen to me.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, call waiting.
leonard_hofstadter No, don't, don't...
howard_wolowitz Hello.
sheldon_cooper Howard, I'm sick.
howard_wolowitz Howard's sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?
sheldon_cooper I need soup.
howard_wolowitz Then call your own mother. It was Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter I tried to stop you.
howard_wolowitz It's my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06.
leonard_hofstadter You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.
howard_wolowitz Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?
debbie_wolowitz I just had the carpets steamed.
howard_wolowitz That's a negatory. But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.
leonard_hofstadter Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start.
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.
penny No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper I'm sick, thank you very much.
penny How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.
sheldon_cooper You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!
penny Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.
sheldon_cooper I want soup.
penny Why didn't you just... Why didn't you just have soup at home.
sheldon_cooper Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?
penny You can have soup delivered.
sheldon_cooper I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.
penny Okay, what kind of soup do you want.
sheldon_cooper Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.
penny We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
sheldon_cooper Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Then surprise me. Would you call that moss green or forest green?
howard_wolowitz Look at this, everyone went chimp.
raj_koothrappali Well I'd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. .
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi Penny!
penny Hey, where are you?
leonard_hofstadter I'm... uh... at work.
penny You sound funny.
leonard_hofstadter I'm... uh... in a... I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?
penny Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory. Just tell him to go home.
penny He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.
leonard_hofstadter He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.
penny Can you please come get him?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, I'd be... I'd be happy to Penny. Oh my God there's a breech in the radiation unit The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! I feel really guilty.
raj_koothrappali You did what you had to do.
howard_wolowitz Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.
sheldon_cooper Thanks for bringing me home.
penny Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.
sheldon_cooper Good. Good.
penny Okay, well, you feel better.
sheldon_cooper Wait, where are you going?
penny Um, home, to write some bad checks.
sheldon_cooper You're going to leave me?
penny Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?
sheldon_cooper Well, of course, but, not by myself.
penny Really, never?
sheldon_cooper Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.
penny Studying abroad?
sheldon_cooper No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
penny And there was no-one there to take care of you?
sheldon_cooper No. No, my mom had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.
penny Again?
sheldon_cooper It was tornado season. And it was an aluminum house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said 'Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?'
penny What does that mean?
sheldon_cooper Based on what happened next, I assume it means 'would you like an enema?'
penny Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?
sheldon_cooper Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.
penny Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.
sheldon_cooper Agreed.
raj_koothrappali Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.
leonard_hofstadter Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?
howard_wolowitz Sorry. Found 'em.
leonard_hofstadter Oh great.
howard_wolowitz Sorry, don't you have a spare.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, at home.
raj_koothrappali Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.
howard_wolowitz Unless Sheldon's there, in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. He's home, I'm screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.
raj_koothrappali How about Lasic?
leonard_hofstadter You want me to get eye surgery?
raj_koothrappali Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
howard_wolowitz Well?
leonard_hofstadter I'm thinking!
penny Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I'll see you later.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
penny Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?
sheldon_cooper Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
penny But Sheldon...
sheldon_cooper Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
penny I can't believe I'm doing this.
sheldon_cooper No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.
penny Sorry.
sheldon_cooper Can you sing 'Soft Kitty'.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
penny I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
sheldon_cooper I'll teach you. 'Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.' Now you.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty...
sheldon_cooper Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
penny Little ball of fur.
leonard_hofstadter What do you see, what do you see.
raj_koothrappali The living room appears to be empty.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.
howard_wolowitz I'm not going in there.
leonard_hofstadter Raj?
raj_koothrappali No way, Jose.
leonard_hofstadter Well I can't do it, I can't see anything.
howard_wolowitz It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes.
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
howard_wolowitz One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.
leonard_hofstadter Won't my footsteps set it off?
howard_wolowitz No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.
leonard_hofstadter Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?
howard_wolowitz Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz It means go straight.
leonard_hofstadter Then just say go straight.
howard_wolowitz You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true.
leonard_hofstadter Alright I just hit my head.
howard_wolowitz Because you didn't keep true. Okay, turn right.
raj_koothrappali The... the picture's breaking up.
howard_wolowitz Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. That's it, now just keep true. Alright, you're close enough to Sheldon's room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn't on?
howard_wolowitz No.
leonard_hofstadter Then why did I have to crawl?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I guess you didn't.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, it's on.
howard_wolowitz Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.
leonard_hofstadter I know.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, the sensor's picking up something, turn your head back.
penny You rat bastard.
howard_wolowitz Told you the sensor would work.
leonard_hofstadter Hi!
penny You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I had to, you see what he's like.
sheldon_cooper Penny! Penny, I'm hungry.
penny Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!
leonard_hofstadter No!
penny Here you go, good luck, bye.
leonard_hofstadter W-wait!
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I'm hungry!
leonard_hofstadter Wait! Penny! Take me with you!
sheldon_cooper I want grilled cheese.
sheldon_cooper Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
leonard_hofstadter I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
sheldon_cooper I'm very congested.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, so?
sheldon_cooper Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.
leonard_hofstadter If I stand, I'll vomit.
sheldon_cooper Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.
