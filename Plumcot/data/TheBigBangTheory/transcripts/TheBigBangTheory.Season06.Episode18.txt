leonard_hofstadter Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.
howard_wolowitz I got whine.
sheldon_cooper I got the B word.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.
howard_wolowitz Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.
sheldon_cooper If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
leonard_hofstadter Helping women? Y
sheldon_cooper Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
sheldon_cooper I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
sheldon_cooper I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.
leonard_hofstadter You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.
sheldon_cooper Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.
sheldon_cooper Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
leonard_hofstadter Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
sheldon_cooper I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.
howard_wolowitz Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
sheldon_cooper We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
howard_wolowitz So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?
sheldon_cooper No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game
sheldon_cooper How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
howard_wolowitz Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
sheldon_cooper Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
sheldon_cooper All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
leonard_hofstadter That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?
sheldon_cooper Some people are otters, some people are rocks.
leonard_hofstadter I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
howard_wolowitz Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.
leonard_hofstadter That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.
howard_wolowitz What exactly are you looking up?
sheldon_cooper How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter No!
raj_koothrappali Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
penny Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
raj_koothrappali Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.
raj_koothrappali Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you.
penny Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
raj_koothrappali Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.
amy_farrah_fowler I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.
bernadette_rostenkowski Weekends are too crowded.
penny So, blow off work, go on a weekday.
amy_farrah_fowler Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
penny It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
bernadette_rostenkowski Joke?
penny I can laugh about it now.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?
penny I’m in.
amy_farrah_fowler Me, too.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
penny Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?
raj_koothrappali I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.
penny Yeah, that’s a toughie.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s think.
amy_farrah_fowler Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?
leonard_hofstadter It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
howard_wolowitz Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.
sheldon_cooper This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.
leonard_hofstadter And now you’re also an astronaut.
howard_wolowitz So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. Hey.
kid#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 What?
howard_wolowitz Nothing.
sheldon_cooper Smart. We don’t want any problems.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.
bernadette_rostenkowski What did you tell your boss?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.
bernadette_rostenkowski Penny, what did you say?
penny I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.
amy_farrah_fowler So, what are we gonna do first?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, that sounds like fun.
penny You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, do it with us.
penny All right, whatever. How does it work?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.
penny Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
penny Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski We can’t all be Cinderella.
amy_farrah_fowler Then how do we decide?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 In a library?
raj_koothrappali She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 People say I’m a little awkward, too. May I join you?
raj_koothrappali No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 You can do better.
lucy Oh, we’re eating here? We’re having a texting date? I love that.
raj_koothrappali As you’re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?
howard_wolowitz The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.
girl_1 Did you go to the moon?
howard_wolowitz No, but I did go to the International Space Station.
girl_1 Did you fly the rocket?
howard_wolowitz No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…
girl_1 So you just flew around? That’s kind of like my uncle. He’s a flight attendant.
howard_wolowitz No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?
leonard_hofstadter Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?
girl_2 How did you decide to become a scientist?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.
raj_koothrappali My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix.
lucy That’s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.
raj_koothrappali That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know what you do for a living.
lucy Web design.
raj_koothrappali Anything I might have seen?
lucy I don’t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?
raj_koothrappali No, never. What is porn?
lucy Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.
leonard_hofstadter I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?
howard_wolowitz Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.
sheldon_cooper Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
amy_farrah_fowler We’re here.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a neuroscientist.
bernadette_rostenkowski And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist.
amy_farrah_fowler The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
penny Unless you want to be Cinderella.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come at me. See what happens.
raj_koothrappali This was really fun.
lucy My battery’s dying, so I’m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I’ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I’m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that’s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.
raj_koothrappali I’m counting that as foreplay.
howard_wolowitz Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, and I have a surprise for you.
howard_wolowitz Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, hello, Prince Charming.
howard_wolowitz Milady.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how was your… what?
penny I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.
sheldon_cooper Heard you the first time.
