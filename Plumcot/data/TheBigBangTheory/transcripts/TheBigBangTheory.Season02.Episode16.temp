howard That was close.
raj God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
howard Yeah, still funny, Raj.
leonard There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
howard But what about the creek bed?
sheldon The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.
raj Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed.
sheldon I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
howard I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.
sheldon And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
raj We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
leonard I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
raj We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
howard No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
leonard No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.
sheldon All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.
howard Why don’t I run away and you cover me?
sheldon Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!
howard I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!
leslie Howard, I’m on your team.
howard Oh, Leslie, thank God.
leslie Where’s the rest of your squad?
howard Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?
leslie Dead, all of them.
howard Sorry.
leslie Don’t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn’t listen.
howard Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.
leslie Hmm, that’s the worst part, the waiting.
howard All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
leslie Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn’t it?
howard It kind of does.
leslie I say we make every moment count.
howard I agree. How exactly do we do that?
leonard Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!
howard War is hell.
raj Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
leonard Yeah, more cutbacks.
sheldon Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
leonard You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
sheldon Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.
leslie Hey, guys.
leonard Hey, Leslie.
howard Hey.
leslie Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.
howard That’s great, Leslie. Thanks.
leslie You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.
raj What was all that about?
howard Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.
leonard Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!
sheldon I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.
leonard Are you done?
sheldon No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done.
raj You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
leonard What about it, Howard?
howard Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.
leonard I don’t care about that.
howard Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something.
leonard You and Leslie?
howard In the paintball shed! Twice!
sheldon Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
howard Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
sheldon My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
howard Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.
raj And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.
leonard And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
howard Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful.
penny The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
leonard Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
penny How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
sheldon Hello, Penny.
penny Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon You’re in my spot.
penny Are you planning on sitting here?
sheldon No, I’m going to the comic book store.
penny Then what difference does it make?
sheldon What difference does it make?
leonard Here we go.
sheldon That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
penny What?
leonard Don’t sit in his spot.
penny Fine. Happy?
sheldon I’m not unhappy.
penny Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
leonard Okay, that should do it.
penny Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
leonard That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
penny Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
leonard Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
penny Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.
leslie Boy, your heart’s racing. I must’ve really gotten you going.
howard Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
leslie Sexy.
howard Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
leslie Satisfactory?
howard That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail.
leslie Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?
howard Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.
leslie Isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
howard You know, most people don’t get that.
howards_mother Howard, I’m home!
howard Oh, great.
howards_mother Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis’s neck opened up again!
howard I’m busy, Ma!
howards_mother Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?
howard Don’t come in, Ma!
howards_mother Why not?
leslie He’s got company!
howard Oh, there’s the arrhythmia.
howards_mother Is she Jewish?
howard Are you Jewish?
leslie No.
howard Yes!
howards_mother Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
penny You think he’ll notice?
leonard There’s a chance.
penny Oh, what are we gonna do?
leonard We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.
penny Why do we have to tell him I did it?
leonard Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it.
penny Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
leonard Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
penny I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
leonard We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
penny Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?
leonard Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.
penny Oh, come on. There, butt print.
leonard It’s too small and too perfect.
penny Thank you.
leonard You’re welcome.
penny Shh! Act normal.
leonard Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
sheldon Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
leonard Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly.
sheldon Koothrappali picked me up.
leonard Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
sheldon They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
leonard No, no, friends forgive the little things.
penny You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.
leonard Don’t you dare, missy.
sheldon Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.
leonard What do you mean?
sheldon I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
leonard I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.
leonard Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
sheldon Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
penny Here we go.
sheldon That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
leonard Wackadoodle.
howard You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here. Get up. There. Problem solved. Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.
sheldon Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?
leonard If it were your head, it would be.
penny Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through.
sheldon You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
penny Why not?
sheldon Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
leonard Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon.
sheldon Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”
howard Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…
penny His right hand is calling him?
leonard No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story.
howard I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
leonard I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
howard What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?
penny No. Not at all.
howard Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.
leonard That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
howard Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…
leonard Get out.
howard Bye.
leslie You’re improving.
howard Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
leslie Hey, listen. Saturday my sister’s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It’s black tie.
howard Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not.
leslie Why not?
howard When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date.
leslie Oh, all right. I understand.
howard Thanks.
leslie Hey, I’m really sorry about that Geneva trip.
howard What about it?
leslie Oh, didn’t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn’t make the cut.
howard When did that happen?
leslie About 12 seconds ago.
howard Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?
leslie Actually, I’m trying not to say it.
howard Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.
leslie How so?
howard Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
leslie Well, if I weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I’d be uncomfortable.
howard How so?
leslie ‘Cause then we’d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.
howard So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.
leslie No. No, not at all. You’re also arm candy. So? What do you think?
howard Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!
howards_mother Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
leonard Why are you crouching there?
sheldon This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
leonard I don’t know. Texas?
penny Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.
leonard Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
sheldon From that key maker, I highly doubt it.
penny Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
sheldon All right.
penny There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
sheldon There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
penny Sit on the damn couch.
sheldon Nope.
penny What do you mean, nope? What’s wrong with it?
leonard Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him.
penny It’s exactly the same…
leonard Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
sheldon More?
leonard I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
sheldon Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
leonard Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
sheldon What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
leonard Golden Dragon.
sheldon No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
leonard Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
sheldon But. Oh, this changes everything.
leonard I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
sheldon What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
penny You did make that up, right?
leonard Oh, God, I wish I had.
sheldon Leonard?
leonard Yeah, buddy?
sheldon I still don’t like this cushion.
leonard Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.
penny Thanks for the shoes.
leonard Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
howard What’s the plan?
leonard Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
sheldon Right, just one thing before we start.
leonard What is it, Sheldon?
penny What the hell?
sheldon That was for my cushion.
leonard Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
sheldon I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
penny Screw that.
sheldon She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
leonard He’s right. You can’t.
sheldon Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy
howard Okay, see you.
leonard Where are you going?
leslie Surrender, then Denny’s.
