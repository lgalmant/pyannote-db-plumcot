penny So, what package are you thinking?
leonard Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.
penny Why would we want that?
leonard ‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope.
penny Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
leonard If you’re not into this, we can do it another time.
penny No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.
leonard Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.
sheldon Leonard, have you gotten married yet?
leonard No. Why?
sheldon Good. Don’t do it.
leonard Why not?
sheldon Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
leonard What happened now?
sheldon Amy has ended our relationship.
leonard Oh, no. Seriously?
penny What’s going on?
leonard Amy broke up with Sheldon.
penny She did?
sheldon Is Penny crying?
leonard No.
sheldon No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.
leonard Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
sheldon Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.
leonard Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad.
sheldon Whatever.
penny Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?
amy Not really. Can you come over?
penny Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.
amy Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
penny Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
amy Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.
penny Amy, don’t be like that.
sheldon Why did I just hear Amy’s name?
leonard Penny’s on the phone with her.
sheldon Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care.
penny Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.
leonard Hey.
penny She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
sheldon Amy’s upset? Is it about me?
leonard No, I think it’s because we’re eloping.
sheldon Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.
sheldon Hello.
amy Oh. What are you doing here?
sheldon When last we spoke, you said you needed time.
amy Well, it’s only been 11 hours.
sheldon The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.
amy Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know.
sheldon Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
amy Sure.
sheldon Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again.
amy We’re not back together.
sheldon Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?
amy If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding.
sheldon And who’s this guy you’re taking?
amy There’s no guy.
sheldon Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad.
amy I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends.
sheldon Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?
amy Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
sheldon We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.
leonard They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.
penny Okay.
leonard Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.
penny Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.
leonard I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it.
penny Me, too.
leonard You sure?
penny Yes.
leonard And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
penny Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?
leonard You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
penny What if they call our names?
leonard Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.
penny Oh, and the fairy tale continues.
amy Thank you for doing this.
bernadette Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
amy We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling.
howard Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy.
bernadette Howard.
howard I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
stuart I know what you’re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.
amy Oh. What was her name?
stuart Hey, it’s a true story. I don’t need the third degree.
bernadette For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
sheldon I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.
bernadette Howard, do something.
howard I’m on it.
amy Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.
sheldon I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
amy They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.
raj Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
official So, when you hear the music, that’s your cue. Any questions?
leonard Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.
official Where are the rose petals?!
leonard You know what? It’s fine.
female_voice We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!
penny Really, we’re good.
leonard Yup, just want to get married.
penny Yeah.
official Great. I’ll see you two up there.
leonard This is it.
penny I know.
leonard I love you.
penny I love you, too.
female_voice Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?
penny No, thank you.
leonard We’re good.
sheldon Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.
raj Didn’t even crack the top ten.
sheldon Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.
amy I said I needed time to think.
raj I’m sure you guys will figure something out.
sheldon You hear that? Raj is devastated.
bernadette Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting.
sheldon I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard.
howard I’m not taking sides.
sheldon Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj.
raj Really?
stuart At least you got picked.
official Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?
leonard Yes.
penny No. You wrote vows?
leonard Yeah.
penny Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.
leonard It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.
penny No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this.
leonard Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.
penny Wow.
official Penny?
penny Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.
official Is that the song from Toy Story?
penny He loves that movie.
leonard I do.
bernadette Aw, that was beautiful.
howard Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.
bernadette No, we totally won.
sheldon Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.
amy It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
sheldon Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.
amy You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.
bernadette Amy.
sheldon Will someone take me home?
raj Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride.
penny We did it.
leonard Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch.
howard We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
leonard No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.
penny Can you?
leonard Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
penny Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?
leonard I’m okay.
penny Nicely done.
leonard Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.
penny Well, the night is still young.
leonard Everything all right?
penny Yeah. I guess.
leonard Just tell me.
penny It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl.
leonard Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.
penny You’re right. Just forget it.
leonard Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.
penny Did you feel guilty?
leonard No, she had dental insurance.
penny Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
leonard Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
penny What do you mean, every time you see her?
leonard What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.
penny You still see her?
leonard Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.
penny You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
leonard I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking
penny Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?
leonard No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.
sheldon Hello, Mother.
mrs_cooper Shelly! How’s my baby doing?
sheldon I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
mrs_cooper Oh, what’s going on?
sheldon She broke up with me.
mrs_cooper Oh, Shelly.
sheldon No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.
mrs_cooper Well, let’s not be hasty. Are you sure it’s over for good?
sheldon It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
mrs_cooper You want to tell me what happened?
sheldon Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?
mrs_cooper Good chance.
sheldon Then no, thank you.
mrs_cooper Well, honey, don’t send it back yet. Your sister’s married, and I’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating.
sheldon Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
mrs_cooper When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.
bernadette I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better.
amy Yeah.
howard Everything’s gonna be okay.
stuart You’ve got so much to offer.
amy Thank you.
stuart Any man would be lucky to have you.
bernadette That’s true.
amy I just hope I did the right thing.
stuart I’m sure you did. Maybe that’s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing.
amy Like you’re doing right now?
stuart Exactly.
leonard I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
penny I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not.
leonard Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
sheldon Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.
leonard I’m not glowing. I’m upset.
sheldon Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.
sheldon Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
penny What’s this?
sheldon Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.
penny Oh. That’s so sweet of you.
sheldon Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.
penny I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.
sheldon Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.
penny You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
sheldon He does? Who is it?
penny Some girl named Mandy.
sheldon Mandy Chao?
penny Yeah.
sheldon Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better
penny That’s great.
sheldon Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.
penny That’s ridiculous.
sheldon Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.
penny I’m with Leonard.
sheldon Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?
penny Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.
sheldon Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
penny I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
sheldon Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
penny Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
sheldon I see. Well, I think I’ll be going.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?
penny Sure.
sheldon Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.
howard All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.
bernadette What happened? They just got married.
howard I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.
bernadette Think they’ll break up?
howard I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.
stuart Really?
sheldon Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
leonard Sure, let’s make it an even hundred.
sheldon You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
leonard I wouldn’t.
sheldon And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.
leonard Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.
sheldon Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.
leonard I figured that out.
sheldon You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
leonard Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.
sheldon Really? I never imagined it any other way.
