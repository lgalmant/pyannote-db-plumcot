sheldon_cooper Oh, boy.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
leonard_hofstadter Then what was oh, boy?
sheldon_cooper Great restraint on my part.
leonard_hofstadter There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, how’s that?
sheldon_cooper You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning.
sheldon_cooper That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I know the feeling.
sheldon_cooper Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning.
sheldon_cooper Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
leonard_hofstadter Everybody?
sheldon_cooper You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.
leonard_hofstadter You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
sheldon_cooper He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.
leonard_hofstadter You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to.
sheldon_cooper Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
leonard_hofstadter Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
sheldon_cooper Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
sheldon_cooper Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, do you want to go?
sheldon_cooper Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe.
sheldon_cooper I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?
leonard_hofstadter Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now.
sheldon_cooper I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go.
leonard_hofstadter Well, then don’t go.
sheldon_cooper How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
leonard_hofstadter All right, then go.
sheldon_cooper Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
sheldon_cooper Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.
leonard_hofstadter How was it resolved?
sheldon_cooper It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
howard_wolowitz Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali We could play outside.
howard_wolowitz We could sit on the left side of the couch.
leonard_hofstadter I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
raj_koothrappali Our dreams are very small, aren’t they?
sheldon_cooper Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…
debbie_wolowitz Yeah! Woo-hoo!
sheldon_cooper …the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not gonna be the same without you.
howard_wolowitz Godspeed.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, I don’t like where this is going.
sheldon_cooper I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
howard_wolowitz To the North Pole?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
sheldon_cooper I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.
howard_wolowitz Really?
sheldon_cooper Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?
howard_wolowitz We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
sheldon_cooper I’m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
howard_wolowitz We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
howard_wolowitz Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”
raj_koothrappali But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
howard_wolowitz I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali You still might get on a magazine.
howard_wolowitz So you guys are seriously considering this?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
howard_wolowitz And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
raj_koothrappali Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
sheldon_cooper Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?
leonard_hofstadter I’m in.
raj_koothrappali Me, too.
howard_wolowitz Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.
sheldon_cooper Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny What do you want?
sheldon_cooper I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
penny Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
sheldon_cooper No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
penny You’re all going?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny For three months?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Excuse me.
sheldon_cooper Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
penny Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
penny Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?
penny Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
penny Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
sheldon_cooper Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?
penny Is he serious?
leonard_hofstadter Actually, it would help.
penny All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?
penny Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.
leonard_hofstadter Did she seem upset to you?
sheldon_cooper No. Did she seem upset to you?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?
leonard_hofstadter A little bit.
sheldon_cooper Two for two. I’m on fire.
leonard_hofstadter I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?
sheldon_cooper That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time.
sheldon_cooper Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.
raj_koothrappali Where are your tools?
sheldon_cooper Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.
howard_wolowitz For this I went to MIT.
sheldon_cooper And begin.
raj_koothrappali I think I swallowed some paint!
leonard_hofstadter I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!
sheldon_cooper Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
howard_wolowitz Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I can’t do this.
raj_koothrappali Me either.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
howard_wolowitz You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
sheldon_cooper I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
sheldon_cooper Here, drink slash eat this.
leonard_hofstadter What is it?
sheldon_cooper It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
howard_wolowitz Okay, why?
sheldon_cooper Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant.
sheldon_cooper Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick.
raj_koothrappali But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.
mrs_koothrappali I don’t care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?
raj_koothrappali If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.
dr_vm_koothrappali Don’t talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s not. Howard, tell them.
howard_wolowitz Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.
mrs_koothrappali So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?
sheldon_cooper That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.
howard_wolowitz Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?
debbie_wolowitz Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!
howard_wolowitz I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!
debbie_wolowitz He doesn’t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he’s ashamed!
penny Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?
penny Well, I got you a little going away present.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, a blanket.
penny Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah! So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wow, cool.
penny Oh, I’m gonna miss you. See you later.
leonard_hofstadter Bye.
mrs_koothrappali I told you no. Why don’t you believe me?
debbie_wolowitz ‘Cause it doesn’t make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn’t one Outback Steakhouse?!
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I want a cookie, Meemaw.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s me.
sheldon_cooper But Meemaw just made cookies.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition.
sheldon_cooper What?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
sheldon_cooper Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s very comforting.
sheldon_cooper Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go.
sheldon_cooper Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?
leonard_hofstadter Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
sheldon_cooper What is it?
leonard_hofstadter It’s a blanket with sleeves.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, obviously.
sheldon_cooper All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?
sheldon_cooper She does have a short attention span.
leonard_hofstadter So, I can’t go.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
leonard_hofstadter You really think so?
sheldon_cooper Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!
penny Oh, Leonard, what time is it?
leonard_hofstadter It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
penny Um, I don’t know. You’ll be gone and I’ll notice.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?
penny Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
leonard_hofstadter All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
penny That wasn’t a long hug.
leonard_hofstadter It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
penny Leonard, I don’t know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
leonard_hofstadter Glad we cleared that up.
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter I guess I’ll see you.
penny Okay, have a safe trip.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Bye.
penny Okay, bye. Means I wish you weren’t going.
leonard_hofstadter Damn it.
howard_wolowitz What?
leonard_hofstadter We’re out of ice.
sheldon_cooper All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.
raj_koothrappali What are you working on?
howard_wolowitz Crossbow.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.
raj_koothrappali He’s right.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, wow.
sheldon_cooper It is remarkable.
raj_koothrappali So, who’s up for a movie?
howard_wolowitz Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter’s The Thing?
raj_koothrappali I say double feature.
leonard_hofstadter Dinner’s ready!
sheldon_cooper What are we having?
leonard_hofstadter Reconstituted Thai food.
sheldon_cooper Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
leonard_hofstadter Check.
sheldon_cooper Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
leonard_hofstadter Check.
sheldon_cooper Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, oh, sorry.
sheldon_cooper Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
howard_wolowitz There’s no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
sheldon_cooper Three months. This is gonna be great!
