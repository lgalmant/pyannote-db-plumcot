sheldon_cooper Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI.
leonard_hofstadter If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb.
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.
penny What is that?
sheldon_cooper Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder.
penny Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.
leonard_hofstadter That someone has a name.
sheldon_cooper Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.
leonard_hofstadter Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
penny I park fine.
sheldon_cooper Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.
sheldon_cooper That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.
leonard_hofstadter Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
sheldon_cooper And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.
leonard_hofstadter Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
sheldon_cooper Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart.
leonard_hofstadter Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
meemaw Moon Pie.
sheldon_cooper Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.
meemaw I’m so happy to see you, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.
leonard_hofstadter Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.
meemaw Thank you.
sheldon_cooper No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four.
meemaw Is that nice to say to your friend?
sheldon_cooper It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Can you please live with us forever?
howard_wolowitz That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?
howard_wolowitz I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.
raj_koothrappali She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Which is probably why that movie sucks.
howard_wolowitz Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.
raj_koothrappali I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Wow. You’ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?
howard_wolowitz You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
raj_koothrappali It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.
sheldon_cooper Are you comfortable?
meemaw Very. It’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.
sheldon_cooper You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi. Nice to meet you.
meemaw Nice to meet you, too.
amy_farrah_fowler How was your trip?
meemaw Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.
amy_farrah_fowler Can I have a tissue?
meemaw Of course.
sheldon_cooper Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.
meemaw He’s been saying that since he was little. I still don’t know what it means.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.
meemaw Oh, now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.
sheldon_cooper If I did, would I find any?
meemaw Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.
sheldon_cooper That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…
meemaw Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.
amy_farrah_fowler S, s, si, size me up?
meemaw Sheldon’s mother may be okay with you, but I’m not so easy.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me.
meemaw Oh, you better hope so.
sheldon_cooper A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.
meemaw Oh, you’re welcome, Moon Pie.
sheldon_cooper Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I see you’re reading Saga.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Yeah, I hear it’s pretty good.
raj_koothrappali It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 I’ll take your word for it.
howard_wolowitz You should. He’s really looked.
raj_koothrappali I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Claire.
raj_koothrappali Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire.
claire It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing.
howard_wolowitz You’re a screenwriter?
claire Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
claire You’re really a scientist?
raj_koothrappali Well, astrophysicist.
claire That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids.
raj_koothrappali Sure. I love animated movies.
howard_wolowitz He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
claire Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, great.
claire See ya.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, bye.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali So?
howard_wolowitz So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?
raj_koothrappali I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
howard_wolowitz Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?
raj_koothrappali I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
penny Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?
meemaw Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey.
sheldon_cooper Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.
meemaw Thank you, Moon Pie.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?
meemaw ‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy.
leonard_hofstadter@penny She could just eat him up.
sheldon_cooper And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.
meemaw It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar.
sheldon_cooper How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, now I know.
sheldon_cooper Yeah.
meemaw So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.
penny Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
meemaw Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.
amy_farrah_fowler I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.
meemaw That doesn’t bode well.
amy_farrah_fowler Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work.
meemaw Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby.
leonard_hofstadter That’s my best friend.
penny Yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.
meemaw I appreciate your honesty, dear.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
meemaw And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, maybe I don’t like you either.
sheldon_cooper Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s.
amy_farrah_fowler I think I should leave.
sheldon_cooper But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time.
amy_farrah_fowler The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this.
meemaw Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.
amy_farrah_fowler What ring?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should give them some privacy.
penny Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
amy_farrah_fowler You have an engagement ring?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny, did you know about this?
penny All right, let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler When did you get an engagement ring?
sheldon_cooper My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
meemaw Well, thank goodness for that.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t think I could do that.
meemaw Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.
sheldon_cooper I’m gonna opt out of that one, too.
amy_farrah_fowler Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.
sheldon_cooper All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?
meemaw You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her.
raj_koothrappali Just to help her with her screenplay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad.
howard_wolowitz You weren’t there. He was really flirting.
raj_koothrappali Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
howard_wolowitz Really? So it’s okay if I fl…
bernadette_rostenkowski Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?
raj_koothrappali Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?
howard_wolowitz No. Never.
bernadette_rostenkowski Absolutely.
howard_wolowitz What?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.
howard_wolowitz Fine. I had reservations about you, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, you didn’t.
howard_wolowitz No, I didn’t.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.
howard_wolowitz Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose.
penny Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.
leonard_hofstadter Did it?
penny Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.
sheldon_cooper Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
penny Come in.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
sheldon_cooper No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
penny Uh-oh.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?
raj_koothrappali All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.
howard_wolowitz Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.
bernadette_rostenkowski Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
howard_wolowitz And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.
raj_koothrappali I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. It could totally happen.
claire Hello?
raj_koothrappali Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.
claire Hey, what’s up? Figure out what time you’re free?
raj_koothrappali Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.
claire Okay. Good for you.
raj_koothrappali Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.
claire I didn’t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.
raj_koothrappali Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?
claire Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
claire Sure, we had a vibe.
raj_koothrappali I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?
bernadette_rostenkowski You still have a girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.
claire Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.
raj_koothrappali Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding.
claire Look, it’s just coffee. I’ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.
raj_koothrappali Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.
claire Great. I’ll text you.
raj_koothrappali Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you gonna tell Emily?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.
howard_wolowitz When are you gonna tell Emily?
raj_koothrappali He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.
meemaw I know more than you think I do.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
meemaw Young lady, if you think I don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you’re wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
meemaw There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?
meemaw Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again.
penny Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
sheldon_cooper No, I wouldn’t.
leonard_hofstadter Just get in here.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny Go ahead.
sheldon_cooper Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.
meemaw I did.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.
leonard_hofstadter He never disappoints, does he?
amy_farrah_fowler I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?
sheldon_cooper Well…
penny Say yes.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
meemaw Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won’t stand in your way.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?
meemaw I suppose.
sheldon_cooper I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.
claire This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn’t too scary for children.
raj_koothrappali And that’s how Mommy and Daddy met.
claire Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?
raj_koothrappali I will.
