leonard_hofstadter Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.
penny I’m the dumplings.
howard_wolowitz Yes, you are.
penny Creepy, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Creepy good or creepy bad?
leonard_hofstadter Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
howard_wolowitz That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. I’m not necessarily talking to the food.
penny Sit over there.
sheldon_cooper Sit over there. Baby wipe?
penny What do you have….
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!
sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you why.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter O-o-o-oh!
sheldon_cooper I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
penny I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Why? Don’t!
sheldon_cooper Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
raj_koothrappali Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new… ew-ew-ew
penny Gosh, Raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? Okay, well, I’ll just, um, go eat by myself.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you don’t have to do that.
penny No, it’s okay, between him not talking, him talking and… him, I’m better off alone, so, goodbye you poor strange little man
raj_koothrappali She’s so considerate.
howard_wolowitz So what’s your news?
raj_koothrappali Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
raj_koothrappali Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Well, wow, that’s incredible.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?
raj_koothrappali Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
sheldon_cooper If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
raj_koothrappali It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I’d so do her.
leonard_hofstadter You’d do the dolphins.
howard_wolowitz Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
raj_koothrappali Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
howard_wolowitz Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.
raj_koothrappali It’s a lease.
sheldon_cooper I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
raj_koothrappali Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
sheldon_cooper What people?
raj_koothrappali The people from People.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?
raj_koothrappali Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.
leonard_hofstadter Are you proud of yourself?
sheldon_cooper In general, yes.
sheldon_cooper Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?
leonard_hofstadter Hi Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.
howard_wolowitz Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
sheldon_cooper Apologise, for what?
leonard_hofstadter Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive.
sheldon_cooper I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
howard_wolowitz You were a colossal ass-hat.
sheldon_cooper Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.
leonard_hofstadter Really, do tell.
sheldon_cooper How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
sheldon_cooper I had not considered that.
leonard_hofstadter Come on.
sheldon_cooper I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
howard_wolowitz He can feel sadness?
leonard_hofstadter Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension.
leonard_hofstadter And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him.
sheldon_cooper But I’m not.
howard_wolowitz Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that.
sheldon_cooper Fine, what do you want me to do?
leonard_hofstadter Smile.
howard_wolowitz Oh crap, that’s terrifying.
leonard_hofstadter We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.
howard_wolowitz Try less teeth.
leonard_hofstadter Close enough, come on. Hi Raj.
raj_koothrappali Hey guys, what’s up?
howard_wolowitz We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
leonard_hofstadter Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?
raj_koothrappali It’s very nice of you, I would like that.
dr_eric_gablehauser Hello boys.
raj_koothrappali Dr Gablehouser.
dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Koothrappali.
leonard_hofstadter Dr Gablehauser.
dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Hoffstadter.
sheldon_cooper Dr Gablehauser.
dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Cooper.
howard_wolowitz Dr Gablehauser.
dr_eric_gablehauser Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I’ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?
raj_koothrappali Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.
dr_eric_gablehauser I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.
sheldon_cooper Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper Oh, sorry.
dr_eric_gablehauser Well, we’ve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.
raj_koothrappali Really, you don’t have to go to any trouble.
dr_eric_gablehauser How about if I put you in Von Gerlick’s old office?
raj_koothrappali I’d rather have Fishbine’s, it’s bigger.
dr_eric_gablehauser Done.
howard_wolowitz Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.
sheldon_cooper He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Damn, this is hard.
dr_eric_gablehauser Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?
leonard_hofstadter Science?
dr_eric_gablehauser Money.
howard_wolowitz Told you.
dr_eric_gablehauser And this boy’s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well, taller than you
howard_wolowitz I have a master’s degree.
dr_eric_gablehauser Who doesn’t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President’s dining room?
raj_koothrappali I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
dr_eric_gablehauser It’s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.
raj_koothrappali Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys.
leonard_hofstadter You can stop smiling now.
sheldon_cooper Aaaah!
raj_koothrappali So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?
leonard_hofstadter No.
raj_koothrappali It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
sheldon_cooper Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me. Oh, it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.
howard_wolowitz They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
sheldon_cooper Have we at this point met our social obligations?
leonard_hofstadter Not yet.
raj_koothrappali Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him.
leonard_hofstadter You just got him this afternoon.
raj_koothrappali Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.
leonard_hofstadter A lackey?
raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
sheldon_cooper Now?
leonard_hofstadter Almost.
raj_koothrappali Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.
howard_wolowitz Oh, gee, thanks.
raj_koothrappali Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.
sheldon_cooper There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point.
penny Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?
howard_wolowitz Gee, I’d love to Raj, but I can’t make it.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, no I… the… no.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I can make it, but I won’t.
penny What are you guys talking about?
raj_koothrappali Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.
penny And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?
sheldon_cooper A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
howard_wolowitz That would be cool. I’d go to that reception.
penny Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.
raj_koothrappali Would you like to go with me?
penny Of course I would, I would be honoured.
raj_koothrappali Really? Cool.
penny Shame on you guys.
raj_koothrappali Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
sheldon_cooper Now?
leonard_hofstadter Now.
raj_koothrappali Hey, buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine.
charlie_sheen Yeah, call me when you’re on the cover.
penny Oh, Raj, look at you!
raj_koothrappali I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?
penny Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?
raj_koothrappali It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready.
penny Oh, I’m ready.
raj_koothrappali That’s what you’re wearing.
penny Um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?
raj_koothrappali Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.
penny Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get.
raj_koothrappali Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.
penny Hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
raj_koothrappali Dude.
leonard_hofstadter You look very nice.
penny@raj_koothrappali Thank you.
penny Uh, come on, good night Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
raj_koothrappali It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific.
raj_koothrappali It has more food too.
penny Alright, come on, come on.
raj_koothrappali I’m coming up so you better get this party started.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.
leonard_hofstadter Anythingforagreencard.com?
howard_wolowitz I’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis.
leonard_hofstadter You’re joking.
howard_wolowitz Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning English.
leonard_hofstadter Pass.
howard_wolowitz So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a date, and that’s racist.
howard_wolowitz It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
sheldon_cooper Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Brown rice, not white?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome.
sheldon_cooper What took you so long?
leonard_hofstadter Just sit down and eat.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?
sheldon_cooper I want you to check before you accept the order.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
sheldon_cooper Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
leonard_hofstadter He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
sheldon_cooper Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.
howard_wolowitz Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
sheldon_cooper That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
leonard_hofstadter Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
sheldon_cooper No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.
howard_wolowitz Lucky?
sheldon_cooper Yes, Lucky.
leonard_hofstadter He’s irony impaired, just move on.
howard_wolowitz Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.
sheldon_cooper While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.
howard_wolowitz So, not a puppy?
sheldon_cooper Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.
leonard_hofstadter A griffin?
sheldon_cooper Yes, half eagle, half lion.
leonard_hofstadter And mythological.
sheldon_cooper Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point.
sheldon_cooper My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
leonard_hofstadter You want to breed a new friend?
sheldon_cooper That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane.
leonard_hofstadter That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people.
sheldon_cooper Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested.
leonard_hofstadter If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.
howard_wolowitz And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.
sheldon_cooper He should share our love of technology.
howard_wolowitz And he should know a lot of women.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.
raj_koothrappali Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
penny Yes, it’s very nice, goodnight Raj.
raj_koothrappali No, wait, the evening’s not over.
penny Yes it is.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.
penny Oh, wow, is the evening over.
raj_koothrappali Wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.
penny Wait, meet them.
raj_koothrappali Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I’m not drunk.
mrs_koothrappali Why would you say that?
raj_koothrappali Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.
penny I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
dr_vm_koothrappali I can’t see her, centre her in the frame.
raj_koothrappali Here you go, cute huh?
mrs_koothrappali She’s not Indian.
dr_vm_koothrappali So, she’s not Indian, the boy’s just sowing some wild oats.
penny No, no, there’s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.
mrs_koothrappali What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.
raj_koothrappali What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
dr_vm_koothrappali Look, Rajesh, I understand, you’re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don’t want it for a steady diet.
raj_koothrappali Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go throw up.
mrs_koothrappali What’s wrong with him?
penny I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste. And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
dr_vm_koothrappali She’s feisty. I like that.
penny Raj, what are you doing. . No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.
raj_koothrappali Sorry.
penny Oh, sweetie, it’s okay.
