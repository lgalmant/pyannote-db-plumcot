sheldon Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.
leonard Five.
sheldon Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
howard E.
sheldon And a funny Greek letter.
raj Gamma.
sheldon I said funny.
raj Upsilon?
sheldon Good one. And an electrical charge.
leonard Positive.
sheldon Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a . Okay. No, no. I’ll start over. Professor
howard I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
sheldon Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t.
leonard It’s not funny. That mistake got published.
sheldon Stop! I’m going to wet myself!
raj Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.
howard I wonder what he wants.
leonard Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.
seibert Dr. Cooper?
leonard Told ya.
sheldon Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.
seibert No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.
sheldon You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.
seibert Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation.
sheldon I don’t need a vacation.
seibert You’re obligated to take one. And I’d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I’ll see you all on Monday, except for you.
sheldon But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?
seibert Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.
sheldon Sarcasm?
howard No. You should go.
leonard That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…
sheldon Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
leonard What the hell are you doing?
sheldon Bleeding from my ears.
leonard What are you doing hiding back there?
sheldon I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps.
leonard Lobster traps?
sheldon Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
leonard What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
sheldon Will they, Leonard?
leonard Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there.
sheldon And no more singing.
leonard Fine.
sheldon I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
penny I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
bernadette Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.
amy This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.
bernadette You mean my special day?
amy They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
bernadette If I ever actually ever get married.
penny Why wouldn’t you?
bernadette My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.
penny Ouch.
bernadette Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.
amy Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.
bernadette I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.
penny You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing.
bernadette I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with sex.
penny Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for.
amy You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. You would fetch a unicorn.
leonard Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
sheldon Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.
howard How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.
sheldon My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
raj You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones.
howard I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
raj Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
sheldon It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.
howard I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
leonard Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.
sheldon One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.
howard Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
sheldon Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab.
howard Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?
sheldon Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert.
leonard Hey.
penny Hey, you.
leonard Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.
penny Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?
leonard It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway.
penny What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
leonard Wow. That’s rough.
penny So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?
leonard Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?
penny I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.
leonard Joke all you want, but you think about it.
penny Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.
leonard Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
sheldon Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.
amy I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic.
sheldon Way to kill the mood.
amy Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell.
sheldon Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!
amy Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.
sheldon Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?
amy No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.
sheldon What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.
amy Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.
sheldon I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.
leonard Where’s Howard?
raj No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?
leonard I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
raj Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
leonard Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
raj Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated.
leonard I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
raj Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
howard Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
leonard Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.
howard I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care.
leonard Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.
howard A pre-nup? Wow.
leonard What are you gonna do?
howard I don’t know.
raj Follow your heart.
howard You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable.
howard Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.
raj Like what?
howard I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.
raj Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
sheldon Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
amy Soap spots. Wash ’em again.
sheldon Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
amy Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.
sheldon Biologists are mean.
amy All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.
sheldon There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
amy I’m sure it was.
sheldon I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
amy Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.
sheldon You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
sheldon 366… 367…
amy How’s it going?
sheldon How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.
amy Great.
sheldon Aw, nuts! One…
sheldon This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up.
amy Really? Is that what you think?
sheldon Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true.
amy Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom.
sheldon I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
amy Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right.
sheldon Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.
amy Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
sheldon You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too.
amy Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.
sheldon All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
amy You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you.
sheldon It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.
amy Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
sheldon No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
amy No. But your thumb does.
sheldon Oh, dear.
amy Yeah, you’re a biologist.
howard What are you doing here?
sheldon I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
howard What happened to your thumb?
sheldon You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on.
barman What can I get you?
sheldon Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those.
penny Hey, what are you guys doing here?
howard We’re grown men, we drink at bars.
penny No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
howard Oh, yeah, sure.
penny You and Amy? Good?
sheldon Oh, better than good.
penny You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
howard I’m not signing a pre-nup.
penny All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.
sheldon Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound.
sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy?
amy What do you want?
sheldon I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.
amy Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
sheldon I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
amy That’s not an apology.
sheldon That is your opinion.
amy I want a real apology.
sheldon I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
amy No.
sheldon That my genius…
amy No.
sheldon That the soap was…
amy Sheldon.
sheldon Fine. Sorry.
amy You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday.
sheldon Next year I’m going to Epcot.
bernadette Are you mad at me?
howard No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.
bernadette So, what are we gonna do?
howard You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
bernadette I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though.
howard Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?
bernadette Really? Oh, that’d be so great.
howard Done.
bernadette I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement.
howard Okay.
bernadette And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish.
howard Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?
bernadette So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.
howard You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May.
bernadette In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.
howard They’ve got a phone.
