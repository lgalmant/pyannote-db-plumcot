leonard So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
sheldon Forget it.
leonard Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
sheldon It’s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
leonard If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store.
sheldon Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.
leonard Oh, good God.
sheldon In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
leonard Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?
raj I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air.
howard Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.
raj Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
leonard No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
raj Damn, there’s always a catch.
leslie_winkle Hey, guys.
leonard Hey, Leslie.
leslie So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.
sheldon The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
leslie Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?
sheldon Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person.
girl Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you’re just brilliant.
sheldon That is the prevailing opinion.
leslie Oh, now I’m gonna throw up.
howard Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System.
ramona Ew. Dr. Cooper, I’ve read everything you’ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?
sheldon Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.
howard Woof.
sheldon The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
ramona Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.
sheldon It’s what I do.
howard You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.
ramona Again, ew. You know, I’d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
sheldon I don’t drink coffee.
howard I do. I love me a cup of joe.
ramona Well, it doesn’t have to be coffee. How about dinner?
sheldon I do eat dinner.
ramona Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.
sheldon I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
ramona Excuse me?
leonard Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
sheldon Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
ramona What if I brought food to your place?
sheldon That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.
ramona You got it. I already have your address.
sheldon What a nice girl.
howard Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
sheldon Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
penny Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order. See? Sorry.
ramona That’s okay. Guess I’m taking the stairs.
penny Where you going?
ramona 4-A.
penny Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
ramona No, Dr. Cooper.
penny Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
ramona We’re having dinner.
penny Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
ramona He is cute, isn’t he?
penny Sheldon Cooper?
ramona Hi, Leonard.
leonard Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
ramona Thanks. Where should I put this?
leonard Uh, the kitchen’s fine. Hey, what are you doing?
penny I need to see this.
leonard Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.
sheldon Oh, hello.
ramona Oh, sorry I’m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.
sheldon Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
ramona So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.
sheldon My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
ramona I’m sorry I didn’t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.
leonard Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.
howard To watch, right?
leonard No, come on, now, we’re going out.
penny Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet.
leonard Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.
penny Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what’s Sheldon’s deal?
leonard What do you mean “deal”?
penny You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
leonard Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
penny Come on, everybody has a deal.
howard Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis.
penny I’m sorry?
howard I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
leonard On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
penny Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
leonard Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
penny What are you guys gonna do?
leonard Uh…
howard My mom’s making a brisket tonight.
leonard The one with the little onions? Mmm.
penny Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight.
howard Her loss. Let’s go.
raj Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
leonard Don’t.
leonard Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?
sheldon Yes.
leonard Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
sheldon Not in these pants.
leonard So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?
sheldon Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.
ramona Here’s your spinach mushroom omelette .
sheldon Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
ramona Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.
sheldon Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
ramona Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.
sheldon You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.
leonard Touche.
leslie Morning.
leonard Ah, hey Leslie.
leslie So, Sheldon, I see you’re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.
ramona There won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.
sheldon Oh, good one.
leslie I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I’ll let you keep your lunch money today.
ramona Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you’re going to stay, you’ll have to be respectful and quiet.
leonard Wait for me.
ramona So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
sheldon Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.
ramona You’re so witty.
sheldon Aren’t I?
penny Hey, guys, this package came for y…
ramona Dr. Cooper is working.
sheldon Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles
penny Sorry. Holy crap on a cracker.
leonard Hey, Penny.
penny Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there.
leonard Why? What are they doing?
penny You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.
leonard Hoo-boy.
ramona Dr. Cooper’s working.
leonard Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?
sheldon Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.
ramona You’re not going to Halo night.
sheldon Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>
ramona Didn’t a great man once say, “Science demands nothing less than the fervent and
sheldon He did.
ramona And who was that great man?
sheldon Me. Sorry, Leonard.
leonard Seriously? You’re not coming?
sheldon You heard her. How can I argue with me?
leonard Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.
ramona Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.
sheldon I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
ramona Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games.
sheldon He does on Wednesdays.
ramona Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
sheldon He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
ramona What do you think?
sheldon Drat.
ramona Now shall we get back to work?
sheldon I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. I guess I can wait for the DVD. And then never ever watch it.
montage_of_scenes To the sound of “You Can Be My Yoko Ono” by Barenaked Ladies we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear,sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.
sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny
penny Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
sheldon Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.
penny Get rid of her how?
sheldon I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.
penny Excuse me?
sheldon I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
penny Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
ramona Dr. Cooper?!
sheldon Hide me.
penny Hide you?
sheldon I formally request sanctuary.
ramona Why aren’t you working?
sheldon Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.
penny Oh, man.
ramona I know what’s going on here.
penny Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?
ramona You’re in love with Dr. Cooper.
penny Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it.
ramona Don’t try to deny it. He’s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.
penny Oh, gee, okay.
ramona I know it’s hard, but he’s a gift to the whole world, and we can’t be selfish.
penny Yeah, he’s a gift all right.
ramona Sisters?
penny Um, sure, sisters. Holy crap on a cracker.
leonard Sheldon? What are you doing?!
sheldon It’s Morse code.
leonard Why?
sheldon So we can communicate through the wall.
leonard We are communicating through the wall.
sheldon Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.
leonard I don’t know Morse code.
sheldon It’s very simple. This is A this is B this is C…
leonard Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!
sheldon All right.
leonard Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t Aw! What’s going on?
sheldon Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
leonard I know. When is she going home?
sheldon Never, that’s the problem. I need your help.
leonard What are you talking about?
sheldon I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
leonard That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
sheldon Come on! Don’t nitpick!
leonard Good night.
sheldon Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.
leonard The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
sheldon Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here.
ramona Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
sheldon Now! Do it!
ramona You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
sheldon Godzilla clause?
leonard Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
sheldon Rats.
sheldon I’ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
ramona It’s unbelievable! It’s paradigm-altering!
sheldon And I could not have done it without you.
ramona Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.
sheldon It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?
ramona Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?
sheldon Who’s Nowitzki?
ramona I’m Nowitzki.
sheldon Oh, you want me to share credit?
ramona Uh-huh.
sheldon Get out!
penny Oh, hey, hi.
ramona Oh, bite me!
penny Sisters?
girl Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Kathy O’Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.
sheldon Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler.
kathy Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
sheldon Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
kathy Great. I’ll bring it to your place. I have the address.
sheldon What a nice girl.
leonard Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
sheldon Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll.
sheldon More Pad Thai, please.
howard Sheldon, you’ve already had four servings.
raj You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
sheldon Just one more bite.
leonard Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon I’m just so… full.
leonard That’s it. No more Thai food.
