sheldon Penny, hello.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon What is shaking?
penny I’m sorry?
sheldon It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
penny What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
sheldon I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
penny Please don’t do that.
sheldon All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
penny So, this wasn’t the awkward part?
sheldon No.
penny Oh, all right. S’u’up?
sheldon Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?
penny Okay, feeling the awkward now.
sheldon Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
penny Yeah, Leonard told me.
sheldon Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
penny To you?
sheldon Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.
penny Well, what about me?
sheldon The statement stands for itself.
penny Well, aren’t you sweet?
sheldon Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.
penny Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.
sheldon You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.
penny Really?
sheldon Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
penny I could think about you.
sheldon Fine, whatever works.
penny Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
sheldon Uh, peace out!
sheldon Well, this is very pleasant.
leonard I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
sheldon And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
leonard I stand corrected.
sheldon You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.
steph That’s very interesting.
sheldon Thank you.
leonard She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
sheldon Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
steph No.
sheldon Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
steph Ih-uh, strawberries.
sheldon Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?
steph Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.
sheldon Really? That’s where I was born!
steph You’re kidding!
sheldon I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.
steph Why, what-what-what happened?
sheldon Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
steph I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?
sheldon No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.
leonard Uh, Sheldon?
sheldon Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? Look at that, there’s even pasta left over.
leonard Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
sheldon I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.
leonard Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?
sheldon To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
leonard What landing party?
sheldon You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy.
steph So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest cavity, one of my earrings.
leonard Oh, my god, what did you do?
steph What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
sheldon I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
leonard Oo-oo-oh!
steph Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.
leonard What invitation?
sheldon We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.
leonard Oh, clearly I could have.
sheldon It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.
steph No, no, we have seats.
leonard Not the right seats.
steph What is he doing?
leonard He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
steph Does he always do this?
leonard Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
steph No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet.
sheldon My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?
leonard No, just sit here.
sheldon Oh, yeah, this is it.
sheldon Leonard Leonard Leonard.
leonard What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
sheldon Tell me what you see here.
leonard The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
sheldon This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?
leonard Stephanie Barnett is single.
sheldon Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
leonard It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
sheldon You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.
leonard Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
sheldon I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.
leonard General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
sheldon Give me one good reason why not.
leonard Because this is not Star Trek
sheldon Penny Penny Penny.
penny What?
sheldon This is banana bread.
penny This is a door knob.
sheldon It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
penny Sheldon, would you like to come in?
sheldon I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
penny No.
sheldon How can you be sure?
penny Sheldon, what do you want?
sheldon I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.
penny He’s having problems with Stephanie?
sheldon She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
penny What?
sheldon Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.
penny We never got to the bedroom.
sheldon Because?
penny Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
sheldon It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?
sheldon Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.
raj You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
howard I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
sheldon More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
howard Oh, I don’t think you can.
sheldon Well, why not?
howard Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
raj During which she defected to North Korea.
howard Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
raj For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
howard And a three hour dinner with Penny.
raj Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
howard Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
sheldon Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
raj Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
howard I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on.
sheldon So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?
howard Yes.
raj Yeah.
sheldon Penny Penny.
penny What?
sheldon Penny. Zucchini bread.
penny Oh, thank you.
sheldon May I come in?
penny No.
sheldon I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
penny Well, thank you.
sheldon So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
penny Yes.
sheldon Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
penny What?
sheldon I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.
leonard All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?
steph Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.
sheldon Oh, hi Stephanie.
steph Hi.
leonard Want some more wine?
steph Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight. .
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
leonard Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
sheldon I’m helping you with Stephanie.
leonard By making constipated moose sounds?
sheldon When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
leonard Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
sheldon Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.
leonard Oh, for god’s sakes.
sheldon Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened.
steph Do you want some help with that?
leonard No, no, no, I got it.
sheldon No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it.
steph Oh my god, are you okay?
leonard No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.
sheldon Like a gladiator!
steph Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches.
leonard Stitches? With a needle?
steph Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
leonard Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.
sheldon FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.
sheldon What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.
leonard I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
sheldon Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
leonard I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
sheldon Watery?
leonard She stuck a needle into my hand!
steph Hey, how’s my big cry baby?
leonard I didn’t cry.
steph Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?
leonard Oh, are you still going to spend the night?
steph Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.
sheldon She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.
leonard Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.
steph Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers.
leonard What?
sheldon Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.
leonard Hey, can you open this for me?
raj Can I see your stitches?
leonard Sure. .
raj Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
penny Leonard, congratulations.
leonard What for?
penny Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
leonard What? no. no, that’s not right.
howard Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
penny Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold.
leonard It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status.
penny Well, then who did?
sheldon I had no choice, he cried in front of her.
leonard You hacked my facebook account?
sheldon Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.
leonard Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
sheldon In which I am not an expert.
leonard Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
penny What’s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.
howard Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
leonard Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
sheldon If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
