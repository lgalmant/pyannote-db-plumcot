howard Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?
bernadette Here comes another contraction.
stuart Let’s pick it up.
raj All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.
howard Stop that, this isn’t India.
raj Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
howard Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
raj I love you, too. We’re good.
sheldon Amy? Wake up.
amy What’s wrong?
sheldon It’s midnight. Happy birthday.
amy Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.
sheldon This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.
amy I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
sheldon A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.
amy I love it. Thank you.
sheldon And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.
amy Is that okay?
sheldon I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.
amy You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.
penny Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby.
leonard Come on, we’re going to the hospital.
amy I guess, I guess we should stop.
sheldon Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.
midwife Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?
howard I’m the father.
midwife Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?
howard No idea. Ask him.
raj 12 minutes.
midwife 12 minutes? Why are you here?
stuart Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?
midwife This is a hospital, not the airport.
bernadette I’m sorry. It’s our first time.
midwife It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?
howard No, we’re keeping it a surprise.
midwife Old school. Nice.
bernadette Not that old school. He knows.
raj You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.
howard And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
midwife Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.
raj I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?
midwife I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.
penny Sheldon, what took you so long?
sheldon Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
leonard Damn, I need my inhaler.
amy Just don’t smoke.
leonard No, I went down the stairs too fast.
penny Hey.
raj Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
penny Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?
bernadette We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.
penny Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.
amy Well, first deliveries can be slow.
sheldon I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
leonard I found it, but it’s empty.
penny Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now.
leonard Are you sure? I’d really like to.
amy Well, should we, uh, head back up?
penny Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?
amy Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?
sheldon It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide.
penny Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.
amy Uh.
penny We could go to a bar.
amy Well.
leonard Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.
penny Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
sheldon That’s a bit childish, isn’t it?
penny I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
sheldon Grape. I find it the most mild.
penny All right, well, you two go have fun.
leonard If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.
penny Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.
bernadette Do you really need to record this?
raj You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t.
howard All right, enough with the camera.
raj Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.
howard I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?
raj I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!
stuart You’re doing great.
bernadette Raj.
raj Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
bernadette How could you?
howard We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it.
raj Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.
stuart You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it.
bernadette Raj.
raj You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
stuart Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.
amy So, where were we?
sheldon Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.
amy I’m sorry.
sheldon Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.
amy Well, shall we start over?
sheldon Very well.
amy What’s wrong?
sheldon I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
amy Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush.
sheldon Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them.
amy And the mood continues to change.
sheldon No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this.
amy Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
sheldon Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
amy No.
sheldon Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…
amy It’s not about trains.
sheldon Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
amy Stop talking about trains.
sheldon Who’s killing the mood now?
leonard Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?
penny Well, I didn’t until I heard that.
leonard Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.
raj Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.
penny Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away.
raj You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
sheldon Can I look yet?
amy One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter.
sheldon Wowza.
amy I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
sheldon What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.
amy I did. Am I in trouble?
sheldon Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.
amy Wait, what just happened?
sheldon You know I’ve been wanting to go.
amy Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?
sheldon Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry.
amy Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
raj Hello.
amy Is this about the baby?
raj No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
amy Good. Then you’re used to this.
penny Hey, Bernadette’s water broke.
leonard Come on, everyone to the hospital.
amy You have got to be kidding me.
howard Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.
stuart I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night.
bernadette Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right.
stuart All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out.
penny Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
raj This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.
leonard Well, it is their child.
raj I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.
sheldon Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
raj And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
amy I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?
sheldon She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.
howard Deep breaths, slow breaths.
bernadette I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
stuart Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more.
howard Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back.
stuart Okay.
howard So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.
bernadette We could name her after your mom.
howard Debbie? No. She hated that name.
bernadette Did she have a middle name?
howard Melvina.
bernadette Let’s keep thinking.
howard Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.
bernadette I know.
howard Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.
bernadette She did always have candy in her pocket.
howard Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.
bernadette I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?
howard Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today.
leonard It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.
amy Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie.
penny How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
leonard It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come.
stuart Hmm. You two got married.
amy Sheldon and I are living together.
sheldon But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.
leonard Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep.
penny Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.
stuart Howard went to space.
amy Bernadette got her doctorate.
leonard Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.
amy We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.
raj For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you.
stuart What’s your problem?
raj Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.
sheldon I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.
stuart Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago.
raj Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
sheldon Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say.
raj Excuse me.
leonard Sorry, Stuart.
stuart Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine.
howard Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class.
bernadette I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.
howard Do you want me to get the nurse?
bernadette No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off.
leonard I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
sheldon Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted.
raj Hey.
stuart Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?
penny You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.
raj Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move.
penny Anyone else want to try?
stuart Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?
penny Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.
raj I bought the first one, it didn’t fall.
penny Here.
howard She’s here, the baby’s here.
penny Oh!
raj Congratulations.
amy How’s Bernadette?
howard Tired, but great. They’re both great.
penny Does the baby have a name yet?
howard We have named her Halley.
penny – Oh.
leonard Oh, like Halley’s comet.
howard Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.
amy That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking.
howard I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.
raj Really?
howard Of course.
raj You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.
penny Oh, look at all the babies.
sheldon Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about.
amy Kind of hard to see the names.
penny Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.
amy They all look the same to me.
raj Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one.
amy Well, that was quite a day.
sheldon It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.
amy I was afraid you’d be too tired.
sheldon Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is.
