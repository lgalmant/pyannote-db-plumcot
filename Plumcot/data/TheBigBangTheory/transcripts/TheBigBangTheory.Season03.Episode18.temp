raj Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.
howard Yeah, so?
raj So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.
howard What’s your point?
raj My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very nervous around James Cameron.
sheldon It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
leonard Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science.
sheldon And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?
leonard Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You.
sheldon I won?
leonard You won.
sheldon I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
raj Well, good for him.
howard Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.
howard Didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
raj No.
leonard Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses.
sheldon Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.
howard Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.
sheldon Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. Problem.
leonard What?
sheldon They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
howard Well, no, you’re mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can’t do is shut up.
raj Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
sheldon I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
leonard What, to you, is a large crowd?
sheldon Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
penny Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.
sheldon I’m not accepting the award.
penny Why not?
howard Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
penny That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court.
sheldon Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
leonard Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous.
sheldon Am I? Let me tell you a story.
howard Where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?
sheldon I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
penny I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
sheldon I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon Don’t trample me.
sheldon Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. Hello.
leonard Sit down, we want to talk to you.
sheldon Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
penny Just sit.
leonard We think we can help you with your stage fright.
sheldon Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you.
penny Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together.
sheldon Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant.
penny Okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by yourself.
leonard We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
sheldon I do like the X-Men.
penny Did I see X-Men?
leonard Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.
penny Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?
sheldon I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?
penny Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.
sheldon That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?
leonard I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
sheldon What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
leonard My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.
howard Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don’t know, some Indian meditation crap.
sheldon I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.
howard My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that’s 24-7, buddy.
sheldon And I appreciate the pretence.
penny So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?
sheldon No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
howard Oh, that’s not a good name.
raj Okay, Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.
sheldon And yet, you can’t speak to women.
raj True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.
sheldon Okay, but don’t punch me.
raj What?
sheldon When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me.
raj I’m not going to punch you.
sheldon That’s what my sister used to say.
raj Do you want to do this or not?
sheldon I’m sorry. Proceed.
raj All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
sheldon Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.
raj Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis.
sheldon Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?
raj Whatever you like.
sheldon I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
raj Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.
sheldon Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
raj Then, put on a sweater.
sheldon Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
raj Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.
sheldon You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.
raj You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
sheldon Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.
raj All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in Sheldon Square.
sheldon Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.
raj What now?
sheldon A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.
sheldon I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
penny It’ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I’m feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
sheldon Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
penny Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice.
sheldon It’s only one colour.
penny Yeah, so?
sheldon That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
penny Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like.
sheldon Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.
penny No, you’re wrong.
sheldon This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. Okay, I think we have a winner.
penny Where the hell d’you find that?
sheldon In the prom department.
penny It’s ridiculous.
sheldon Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
penny Please just try this one on.
sheldon Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. This is absurd. I look like a clown.
leonard So, Sheldon, how you doing?
sheldon That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.
leonard I’m sorry, I’ll start again.
sheldon Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
leonard Um, I don’t know, maybe.
sheldon I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.
leonard How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
sheldon I was wearing size a million pants.
leonard Why don’t we just talk?
sheldon Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
leonard Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?
sheldon Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.
leonard But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.
sheldon And how did that make you feel?
leonard Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
sheldon Go on.
leonard It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
sheldon So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother.
leonard Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again.
sheldon Thank you, Leonard.
leonard For what?
sheldon If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.
leonard Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!
leonard Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of…
sheldon Oh, dear.
penny What’s the matter?
sheldon I’m getting dizzy.
raj Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.
sheldon I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
penny Here, drink this. It’ll relax you.
sheldon Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
penny Fine, faint.
sheldon I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective.
penny Here, see if this one works.
leonard First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.
sheldon I’m ready.
leonard Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,
sheldon Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?
penny Sure.
sheldon Question one, where are my pants?
leonard You might want to check YouTube.
sheldon What do I search?
leonard It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
onscreen_sheldon All right, people, let’s get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body’s in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.
sheldon Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating.
leonard Uh-uh, give it a minute.
onscreen_sheldon Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here’s Uranus.
