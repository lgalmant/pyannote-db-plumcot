leonard_hofstadter I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.
sheldon_cooper Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.
barber#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.
barber#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 I’m sorry, Uncle Tony’s in the hospital. He’s pretty sick.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?
barber#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 I can cut it for you.
sheldon_cooper You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?
leonard_hofstadter Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber.
sheldon_cooper He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio.
leonard_hofstadter There’s no such thing as haircut records.
sheldon_cooper Yes, there are.
leonard_hofstadter Have you ever seen them?
sheldon_cooper No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?
barber#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 Your what?
sheldon_cooper To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
sheldon_cooper Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you.
barber#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 So my kid said the funniest thing today.
sheldon_cooper Nope.
leonard_hofstadter When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.
sheldon_cooper Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
howard_wolowitz Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
raj_koothrappali Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred.
raj_koothrappali But it says eight a.m.
howard_wolowitz You read it as oh eight hundred.
raj_koothrappali It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
howard_wolowitz You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy.
leonard_hofstadter So, what kind of things are they… will you stop that?
sheldon_cooper I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.
penny You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you.
sheldon_cooper Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, be nice.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.
raj_koothrappali You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
howard_wolowitz Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going
raj_koothrappali Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it.
amy_farrah_fowler What about Supercuts?
sheldon_cooper I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?
sheldon_cooper Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, sweetie.
howard_wolowitz I miss you.
bernadette_rostenkowski I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.
howard_wolowitz Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.
bernadette_rostenkowski Cool. How do they do that?
howard_wolowitz It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.
bernadette_rostenkowski You threw up?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.
bernadette_rostenkowski That sounds mean.
howard_wolowitz No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure, why?
howard_wolowitz I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.
sheldon_cooper Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.
althea Can I help you?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
althea Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut.
althea I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
sheldon_cooper I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.
penny So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm.
penny Well, is it or isn’t it?
leonard_hofstadter You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.
penny Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy.
leonard_hofstadter Like I said, complicated game.
penny So did I win or not?
leonard_hofstadter Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move.
sheldon_cooper Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?
penny Okay, what just happened?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.
penny Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
sheldon_cooper No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.
penny Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, explain it to her.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, he’s crazy.
sheldon_cooper I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time.
leonard_hofstadter Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
penny You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen.
sheldon_cooper Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point.
leonard_hofstadter I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.
leonard_hofstadter Great. What are you going to do first?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
leonard_hofstadter I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him.
penny If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, what happened to you?
howard_wolowitz We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.
bernadette_rostenkowski Survival training? Is that like camping?
howard_wolowitz Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you sleep in tents?
howard_wolowitz No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Poor baby.
howard_wolowitz But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.
howard_wolowitz I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you crying?
howard_wolowitz No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, is there anything I could do to help?
howard_wolowitz No. Wait. Send more underwear.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning.
sheldon_cooper Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
leonard_hofstadter I was sleeping.
sheldon_cooper Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
leonard_hofstadter No, he doesn’t.
sheldon_cooper Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
leonard_hofstadter Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
penny What the hell?!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.
penny Why did you get bongos?
sheldon_cooper Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.
leonard_hofstadter Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
penny Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.
sheldon_cooper Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.
sheldon_cooper Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.
leonard_hofstadter W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
sheldon_cooper Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
penny Where are you going?
sheldon_cooper Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
bernadette_rostenkowski Surprise.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing here?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I love you so much.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I love you.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, your bath is getting cold!
howard_wolowitz Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo.
amy_farrah_fowler He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
leonard_hofstadter Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
amy_farrah_fowler That was kind of uncalled for.
leonard_hofstadter No, it was called for.
sheldon_cooper What’s going on?
penny All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.
sheldon_cooper Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records.
penny All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, duh, what?
penny It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.
sheldon_cooper Amy, what do you think?
amy_farrah_fowler There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim.
sheldon_cooper Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
amy_farrah_fowler There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
leonard_hofstadter What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
sheldon_cooper Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.
penny Almost done.
sheldon_cooper At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.
penny Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes.
sheldon_cooper That’s okay, I never understood them anyway.
penny Okay, what do you think?
sheldon_cooper Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.
penny Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.
sheldon_cooper Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.
penny Okay. Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.
sheldon_cooper Thank you very much.
penny You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move.
