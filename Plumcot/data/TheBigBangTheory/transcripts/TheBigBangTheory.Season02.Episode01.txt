leonard_hofstadter So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.
penny Oh, that’s very interesting.
leonard_hofstadter It’s also not pink and has no berries.
penny Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question.
leonard_hofstadter What was your question again?
penny Do you want some.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant.
penny Right.
leonard_hofstadter So, gas.
penny Got it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, good night.
penny What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter There was a draft.
penny I didn’t feel a draft.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we just go into your….
penny Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.
penny No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.
penny Or we could just wing it.
leonard_hofstadter That might work too.
penny Goodnight Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Goodnight.
raj_koothrappali He’s coming. Screen saver.
howard_wolowitz Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?
leonard_hofstadter Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
sheldon_cooper They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.
howard_wolowitz You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about, the date went fine.
raj_koothrappali Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”
howard_wolowitz No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”
raj_koothrappali You being the fish.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not the fish.
howard_wolowitz Oh really, did you make a second date.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we sort of decided to wing it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, even I know that’s lame.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.
howard_wolowitz Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t say anything like that.
howard_wolowitz Good, ‘cos they don’t work.
raj_koothrappali They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing.
leonard_hofstadter Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.
howard_wolowitz Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.
raj_koothrappali Nice close up, by the way.
sheldon_cooper Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not a bad sign.
sheldon_cooper Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
raj_koothrappali And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.
raj_koothrappali He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
howard_wolowitz Give him time.
penny Hi.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates.
penny Thanks.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?
penny Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
sheldon_cooper I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it.
penny Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.
sheldon_cooper Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
penny No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.
penny How is that not a braniac?
sheldon_cooper Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.
penny So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me.
sheldon_cooper That depends.
penny On what?
sheldon_cooper Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Do you speak Klingon?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Do you know any card tricks?
penny Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
sheldon_cooper Why would you lie about that?
penny Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser.
sheldon_cooper You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
penny You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but you were neither.
penny Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.
sheldon_cooper You’re asking me to keep a secret?
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.
penny Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
sheldon_cooper Physiologically impossible.
penny Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend.
sheldon_cooper So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
penny Well, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?
sheldon_cooper I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.
leonard_hofstadter You could be Batman?
sheldon_cooper Sure. I’m Batman. See.
penny Hi guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hi Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.
penny Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.
leonard_hofstadter What about Saturday?
penny You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.
leonard_hofstadter Great. So you just let me know when you know. So… Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
sheldon_cooper Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.
leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
sheldon_cooper Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
leonard_hofstadter No I didn’t.
sheldon_cooper I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on with you?
sheldon_cooper Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.
leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong with your face?
sheldon_cooper There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I said Good Day!
leonard_hofstadter Good day?
penny Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…
sheldon_cooper You must release me from my oath.
penny Sheldon, I’m working.
sheldon_cooper Why don’t you take a minute to decide I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
penny Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
sheldon_cooper I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.
penny Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?
sheldon_cooper Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
penny Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m moving out.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?
sheldon_cooper There doesn’t have to be a reason.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, there kind of does.
sheldon_cooper Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out.
leonard_hofstadter I’m still confused.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler.
howard_wolowitz Hey, qu’est q’wass up?
raj_koothrappali We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
howard_wolowitz And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
sheldon_cooper If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack.
howard_wolowitz That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out.
raj_koothrappali What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
leonard_hofstadter No.
raj_koothrappali Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?
raj_koothrappali Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Did you make fun of trains?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane.
raj_koothrappali Well, we all knew this day was coming.
leonard_hofstadter That was fast.
sheldon_cooper It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
leonard_hofstadter Where are you gonna live?
sheldon_cooper Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
howard_wolowitz Bye
raj_koothrappali Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?
raj_koothrappali I hate trains.
sheldon_cooper Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains.
raj_koothrappali Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter This could work.
sheldon_cooper This is a very old building.
raj_koothrappali Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
sheldon_cooper Uh-oh.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
raj_koothrappali Not until now.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it.
raj_koothrappali Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…
sheldon_cooper I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.
raj_koothrappali Terrific.
sheldon_cooper Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
raj_koothrappali Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit.
raj_koothrappali How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
sheldon_cooper Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema.
howard_wolowitz Who is it?
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 Strippergram.
raj_koothrappali Tag. You’re it.
howard_wolowitz Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
sheldon_cooper I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
howard_wolowitz Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?
sheldon_cooper I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
howard_wolowitz Do you want to switch?
sheldon_cooper No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.
howard_wolowitz Get out of bed, we’re switching.
sheldon_cooper Now, only if you want to.
howard_wolowitz Just get in the bed!
debbie_wolowitz What’s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?
howard_wolowitz We’re just talking ma.
debbie_wolowitz If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not going to let you have any more sleepovers.
howard_wolowitz For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night! Comfy now?
sheldon_cooper Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.
howard_wolowitz So don’t look at it.
sheldon_cooper She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
howard_wolowitz No kidding?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.
howard_wolowitz What about Lee Meriwether?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.
howard_wolowitz Well I’m glad that’s settled.
sheldon_cooper That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…
howard_wolowitz Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep.
sheldon_cooper I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.
howard_wolowitz Oh for God’s sake.
sheldon_cooper But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel….
leonard_hofstadter I’m coming!
sheldon_cooper Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.
leonard_hofstadter What’s with him?
howard_wolowitz Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it.
sheldon_cooper I’m ba-ack!
leonard_hofstadter I still don’t know why you left.
sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you.
leonard_hofstadter Why not.
sheldon_cooper I promised Penny.
leonard_hofstadter You promised Penny what?
sheldon_cooper That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
leonard_hofstadter What secret. Tell me the secret.
sheldon_cooper Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad.
leonard_hofstadter Not that secret, the other secret.
sheldon_cooper I’m Batman. Shhhhh!
leonard_hofstadter Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.
sheldon_cooper Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter I promise.
sheldon_cooper Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?
sheldon_cooper I drank milk that tasted funny.
leonard_hofstadter Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.
penny What are you talking about.
leonard_hofstadter First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
penny He told you?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution.
penny Pasadena city college?
leonard_hofstadter A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal.
penny Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college.
penny Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t matter to me at all.
penny So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely. Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. Oh bite me!
