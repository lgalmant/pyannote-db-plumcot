leonard The math is all there. It’s not real.
penny Yes, it is.
sheldon Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.
raj It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
penny Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.
raj Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
penny Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.
leonard Were you drunk?
penny I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
leonard I think you’re the one who fell over.
penny That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
howard Hey.
penny Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
howard Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
sheldon Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.
howard Come on, it’ll be fun.
penny Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.
howard Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.
sheldon Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.
leonard It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
sheldon Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
leonard I want to go.
penny Yeah, me, too.
raj I’m in.
howard Sheldon.
sheldon Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.
sheldon Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
amy We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
sheldon Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
amy Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
sheldon Yes.
penny Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.
leonard You did?
penny Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.
leonard Wait, you went to a chapel?
penny Yeah.
leonard Why?
penny We had one of those silly fake weddings.
leonard Penny, you know those are real, right?
penny No, they’re not.
leonard Yeah, they are.
penny No, they’re not.
leonard Yeah, they are.
sheldon He’s right.
amy They’re real.
penny But it didn’t seem real.
sheldon Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?
bernadette Hi, Dad.
mike Hi, honey.
bernadette Oh, you brought beer for everybody.
mike Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.
bernadette You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, the medicine’s not working.
howard You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.
mike Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?
howard Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.
mrs_wolowitz How can one little toe hurt so bad?
howard Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.
bernadette I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
howard I have a better idea.
bernadette If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.
howard I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
bernadette Oh, well, that’s a great idea.
amy No traffic, we’re sailing.
sheldon Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
amy Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.
sheldon Yes, Miss Amy.
leonard I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
penny Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
leonard Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
penny I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
sheldon Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.
penny So how do I undo this?
leonard I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
penny Great, well, what do I have to do?
amy It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
sheldon Hah!Penny? Next.
amy Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?
penny Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
amy Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.
bernadette Thanks for saving the day.
raj Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?
howard Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.
bernadette I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?
howard He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
bernadette Don’t be silly, he loves you.
howard Does he?
bernadette Okay, he cares about you a lot.
howard Really?
bernadette I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.
howard So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?
mike Uh-huh.
howard You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.
amy Happy Thanksgiving.
sheldon It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…
amy Sheldon.
penny Here. Thank you for having us.
howard What’s with you?
leonard Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.
howard Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.
penny I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
amy You need any help?
raj Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?
amy Uh, sure.
raj Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
amy Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
together What?
howard You ever play football?
mike A little in college. You?
howard No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
leonard Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.
penny Fine.
leonard And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
penny Are you done?
leonard What?
penny Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?
leonard Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.
penny Ugh, I need some air.
leonard Wuh, Penny.
sheldon I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.
mike Listen to Stretch.
leonard How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
howard Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.
mike I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
leonard Sure.
mike I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?
sheldon They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
mike How the hell do you know that?
sheldon My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
penny Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.
leonard Wait, you invited him here?
penny Yeah.
mike I’m getting ready to weigh in again.
leonard Come on.
mike What do you think they ought to do now?
sheldon I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.
howard Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.
mrs_wolowitz Did someone say blintz?
leonard I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
penny Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…
raj Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.
penny Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.
raj No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.
leonard Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.
bernadette What?
amy Ooh!
raj My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.
sheldon I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
howard That’s why I sit.
mike Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?
sheldon 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
mike I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
sheldon So was my dad. And then he did.
howard Anyone need a beer?
mike Yeah.
howard Thank God.
mike So, does your dad still live in Texas?
sheldon No. He died when I was 14.
mike I’m sorry to hear that.
sheldon So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
howard Here you go.
mike Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.
sheldon No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.
mike Well, you’re having one with me.
sheldon All right.
mike To your dad.
howard I never had a beer with my dad, either.
sheldon Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.
amy I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.
raj Wonder what she saw in that guy.
bernadette I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.
amy Broad shoulders, good hair.
raj Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
bernadette How’s it going out there?
howard Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
amy I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.
bernadette What are they doing?
howard They’re drinking beer and watching football.
bernadette So why don’t you do that with them?
howard They don’t want me.
bernadette What do you mean?
howard Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…
amy Zack’s here!
raj Stir the gravy.
bernadette Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.
leonard Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
zack It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.
penny Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?
leonard Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.
penny Okay.
zack I don’t know if I want to sign it.
raj_bernadette_and_amy Ooh.
leonard Why won’t you sign it?
zack I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.
penny We don’t have any kids.
zack Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.
penny Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
zack Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
leonard You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
penny Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.
leonard That is not true.
penny Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.
leonard You’re the one who invited him here.
penny Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.
zack Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.
leonard Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.
zack Oh, no. Are you dying?
penny I’m about to. Sign the paper.
zack Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat.
sheldon Two, three, eight, four, six. That’s all I can do without throwing up.
mike That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.
mrs_wolowitz Did somebody say pie?
mike I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
sheldon All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.
mike Me, too.
bernadette Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
sheldon She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.
amy All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
sheldon Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.
bernadette It’s okay.
howard Don’t worry about it.
amy Thank you.
sheldon Ain’t she great?
mike Mmm.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?
bernadette Thanks again for cooking.
amy Yeah, everything was delicious.
raj Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
mike Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?
sheldon This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.
mrs_wolowitz Did someone say pigskin?
penny Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.
leonard I’m sorry, too.
zack Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
mike I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.
howard Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.
mike Well, I’m drunk.
sheldon I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
