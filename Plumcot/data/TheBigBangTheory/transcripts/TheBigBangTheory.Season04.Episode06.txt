howard_wolowitz Gagh!
leonard_hofstadter Problem?
howard_wolowitz This is the worst cobbler I’ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
sheldon_cooper Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
raj_koothrappali Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.
priya_koothrappali Oh, Sheldon. You haven’t changed a bit, have you?
sheldon_cooper Why would I change?
leonard_hofstadter The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?
priya_koothrappali I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.
raj_koothrappali Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
sheldon_cooper Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible.
leonard_hofstadter And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
priya_koothrappali I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is.
raj_koothrappali Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
sheldon_cooper Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs.
raj_koothrappali I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I’ve got a girlfriend now.
raj_koothrappali Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
howard_wolowitz Let’s just agree they’re both hot.
raj_koothrappali Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about.
howard_wolowitz Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.
raj_koothrappali Did you pinky swear?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
raj_koothrappali Okay then.
sheldon_cooper Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
priya_koothrappali It’s really nice to see you again Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
priya_koothrappali Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Okay.
howard_wolowitz So, you got any special plans with your sister?
raj_koothrappali Oh, not really, just hang out.
sheldon_cooper I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.
raj_koothrappali Train day?
sheldon_cooper The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
raj_koothrappali I don’t think we’re going to do that.
sheldon_cooper Well then apparently, you hate fun.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?
raj_koothrappali Uh, my plans with Priya.
sheldon_cooper He rejected train day.
leonard_hofstadter Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
sheldon_cooper Abundantly.
leonard_hofstadter I guess he just hates fun.
sheldon_cooper That’s what I said.
priya_koothrappali Okay, so, what’s new with you guys.
howard_wolowitz I have a girlfriend now.
priya_koothrappali Hey, good for you.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? .
leonard_hofstadter So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here.
priya_koothrappali I don’t know, I just have the one day.
sheldon_cooper Do you like trains?
priya_koothrappali Not particularly.
sheldon_cooper You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
sheldon_cooper You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.
leonard_hofstadter It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?
sheldon_cooper I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
leonard_hofstadter That’s pretty cool.
sheldon_cooper Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.
leonard_hofstadter You’ve really got to get out more.
sheldon_cooper Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.
priya_koothrappali Raj finally went to bed.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, Sheldon’s still up.
priya_koothrappali You said he goes to bed at nine.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
sheldon_cooper Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.
priya_koothrappali Can’t you get rid of him?
leonard_hofstadter If the past is any indication, no.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.
leonard_hofstadter Drop axe.
sheldon_cooper Drop axe. Brilliant.
leonard_hofstadter Give me a minute. Sheldon,
sheldon_cooper Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
sheldon_cooper I know.
leonard_hofstadter Well then, bed mister.
sheldon_cooper Five more minutes.
leonard_hofstadter Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
sheldon_cooper Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t want that, do you?
sheldon_cooper No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
sheldon_cooper That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work.
sheldon_cooper Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak.
leonard_hofstadter Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
leonard_hofstadter We’re going to have to be very quiet.
sheldon_cooper I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right, you’re lost, good luck.
priya_koothrappali Oh! Leonard, wake up.
leonard_hofstadter Huh! Sorry!
priya_koothrappali For what?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response.
priya_koothrappali It’s six o’ clock, I have to get back to Raj’s before he wakes up and realises I’m gone.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
priya_koothrappali Mmm. Me too.
leonard_hofstadter You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.
priya_koothrappali Where are you going with this, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.
priya_koothrappali Leonard, didn’t we have this conversation five years ago.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.
priya_koothrappali Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn’t mean I want to have a serious relationship.
leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t?
priya_koothrappali Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They’d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
priya_koothrappali Aha, you’re funny.
sheldon_cooper Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I heard a woman laughing.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
leonard_hofstadter Air freshener.
sheldon_cooper And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash.
sheldon_cooper My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
sheldon_cooper Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Do you prefer ointment or cream?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, cream.
sheldon_cooper With or without a numbing agent?
leonard_hofstadter Without.
sheldon_cooper Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. With.
sheldon_cooper Prescription or non-prescription strength.
leonard_hofstadter Use your best judgement.
sheldon_cooper Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds great.
sheldon_cooper Excellent choice.
leonard_hofstadter Right, right, alright.
sheldon_cooper Priya?
priya_koothrappali Good morning, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
leonard_hofstadter Making pretty good time, huh?
sheldon_cooper Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper What do you want to talk about?
leonard_hofstadter Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
sheldon_cooper There it is. What if someone asks?
leonard_hofstadter No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
leonard_hofstadter Like what?
sheldon_cooper Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?
leonard_hofstadter Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
sheldon_cooper In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.
sheldon_cooper And Raj.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, and Raj.
sheldon_cooper And me.
leonard_hofstadter You?
sheldon_cooper Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.
leonard_hofstadter Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
sheldon_cooper You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
leonard_hofstadter My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
sheldon_cooper You mean, you want me to keep a secret.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper You know I can’t keep a secret.
leonard_hofstadter You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?
sheldon_cooper Why do you get to be Batman?
leonard_hofstadter Because, well, Batman has the secret.
sheldon_cooper Well Alfred has secrets too.
leonard_hofstadter Like what?
sheldon_cooper Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret.
sheldon_cooper Ta-da!
leonard_hofstadter What.
sheldon_cooper Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
leonard_hofstadter Kind of busy here, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I know, that’s why I shortened it.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want.
sheldon_cooper I came to go over your alibi for last night.
leonard_hofstadter What alibi?
sheldon_cooper You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?
sheldon_cooper The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God.
sheldon_cooper You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.
leonard_hofstadter Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.
sheldon_cooper And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
mechanical_voice_on_sheldons_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 Top of the morning to you. You’ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.
sheldon_cooper It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.
leonard_hofstadter Where did you get that?
sheldon_cooper From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
leonard_hofstadter An orang-u-tan?
sheldon_cooper Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
leonard_hofstadter C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
sheldon_cooper And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.
raj_koothrappali Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t see it.
howard_wolowitz Didn’t see it? What were you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I was out.
raj_koothrappali On Caprica night?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.
howard_wolowitz Really, you, and where, where did you go?
leonard_hofstadter To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?
leonard_hofstadter As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
sheldon_cooper Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
sheldon_cooper Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.
raj_koothrappali What were you doing with Priya?
sheldon_cooper I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?
raj_koothrappali What? You slept with my sister?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz How could you? We had a pact!
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
sheldon_cooper May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
raj_koothrappali I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
raj_koothrappali How hard did she stomp?
leonard_hofstadter Very hard.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I’m good.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
howard_wolowitz Mmm.
leonard_hofstadter Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
raj_koothrappali Dude! I put that thing on my face!
sheldon_cooper I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.
raj_koothrappali That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
howard_wolowitz And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food.
sheldon_cooper Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.
leonard_hofstadter You put moths in my food?
sheldon_cooper For science.
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, I can’t believe.
