sheldon Boy, do I have to urinate.
leonard If only there were a solution to that.
sheldon Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
leonard So go to the bathroom.
sheldon I can’t.
leonard Why not?
sheldon Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?
leonard Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?
sheldon I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.
leonard Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
penny Hi.
leonard Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?
penny I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
leonard Oh, that’s great.
penny I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.
sheldon Here come the waterworks.
leonard Aren’t you gonna ask?
penny What is this, my first day?
bernadette Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?
penny Yeah, sure.
amy Of course.
bernadette Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.
amy I’m sure it’s lovable.
penny I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?
bernadette Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.
amy Okay.
bernadette But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
penny I’m liking my odds here.
bernadette So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”
penny No.
bernadette “LOL.” Smiley face.
amy Oh, my gosh.
bernadette “P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”
penny Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this? Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?
bernadette Am I a terrible person?
amy No. No, it was a mistake.
bernadette Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
amy Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?
penny No, I didn’t get it.
bernadette I’m so sorry.
amy You’ll get offered something soon.
penny I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it.
bernadette Are you gonna take it?
penny I don’t know what to do.
amy Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?
raj Hey. Emily, right?
emily Yeah.
raj I, I don’t know if you remember me.
emily From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?
raj Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.
emily Uh, don’t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you’re not the weirdest guy I’ve met off the Internet.
raj Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me.
emily All right, here’s your chance.
raj Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.
sheldon So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.
amy Can you get the butter, please?
sheldon You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard.
amy Then get the other one. Pass the butter.
sheldon Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.
amy Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.
sheldon Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.
amy No way.
sheldon Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.
amy Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat.
sheldon No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.
amy Included?
sheldon Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.
amy Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?
sheldon See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.
amy Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?
sheldon Xbox.
amy You’re kidding.
sheldon No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.
amy This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?
amy Please pass the butter!
penny Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.
penny Okay. Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?
leonard Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.
penny No, come on. This is serious.
leonard Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?
penny Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
leonard What does your agent think?
penny She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
leonard You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?
penny Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.
leonard Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?
penny Both of us.
leonard So it’s a family film.
sheldon Thank you again for dinner.
amy You’re welcome.
sheldon Good night.
amy Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?
sheldon Oh, of course. Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?
amy No.
sheldon Well, they do.
raj And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.
leonard So, are you gonna see her again?
raj Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.
penny Okay, like what? Show me.
raj I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
leonard You have my blessing. Go for it.
raj Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.
penny Oh, that’s sad.
raj It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.
penny Wow.
leonard Okay, that’s enough.
sheldon Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?
raj Uh, Xbox One.
sheldon Penny?
penny Huh?
sheldon Leonard?
leonard PS4.
sheldon Wolowitz?
howard Both great.
sheldon Bernadette?
bernadette I like the Wii.
sheldon Thanks, Grandma.
raj Oh, my goodness.
leonard What’s up?
raj I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
leonard Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.
penny Really?
leonard Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.
raj What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
howard Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.
raj I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot.
penny Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal.
raj But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?
howard_and_bernadette Yes.
bernadette What do you mean, yes?
howard What do you mean, yes?
bernadette Were you seeing other women when we started dating?
howard No. Were you seeing other men?
bernadette No.
leonard Were you seeing other men?
penny No.
leonard Aren’t you gonna ask me?
penny Come on, really?
leonard Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
wil_wheaton Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?
penny Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it.
wil Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I’ve been embarrassed by.
penny I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
wil I wasn’t.
penny Me, either.
leonard So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?
wil Well, it’s tricky. You want to take projects that you’re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.
penny Yeah, beam me up. I love it.
wil Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.
penny That’s what I’m afraid of.
wil So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.
leonard Sounds rough.
wil I’m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don’t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can’t even get out of bed.
leonard Okay, this was helpful.
raj Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
bernadette Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition.
raj Oh, no.
bernadette The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.
howard Were you like this when I married you?
leonard Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.
raj Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
penny No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?
raj As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes.
howard He’s gonna die alone, right?
leonard Yes.
penny Yes.
bernadette Yes.
amy I’m proud of you, Sheldon.
sheldon You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice.
amy Well, that’s got to be a good feeling.
sheldon Oh, it is. Although.
amy Oh, crap.
sheldon I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
amy You were just a little kid.
sheldon Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.
amy How old were you then?
sheldon Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.
amy What’s a Zune?
sheldon Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.
amy No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research.
sheldon But what if I’m wrong?
amy You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?
sheldon You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
amy Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.
sheldon Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?
amy How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.
sheldon Interesting.
amy So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One.
sheldon All right, I’ll try.
amy What is it?
sheldon A quarter.
amy Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.
raj You look, you look really pretty tonight.
emily Thanks. I love that jacket.
raj Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew.
emily I don’t understand.
raj My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful.
emily Are you getting back together with her?
raj No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?
emily Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let’s do this. How serious were you two?
raj Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.
emily Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?
raj Yeah.
emily That’s kind of adorable.
raj Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.
emily I’m still here.
raj Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.
emily We just met. You don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing.
raj Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
sheldon On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?
amy I can’t feel my legs.
store_assistant Oh, I’m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.
sheldon But I haven’t decided yet.
store_assistant You’ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.
amy Let’s get you some food. You, You’ll feel better after you eat.
sheldon Okay.
amy What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?
sheldon I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter.
costume_guy How’s that feel?
penny Great. Not like regret at all.
wil Penny? We’re working together. Awesome.
