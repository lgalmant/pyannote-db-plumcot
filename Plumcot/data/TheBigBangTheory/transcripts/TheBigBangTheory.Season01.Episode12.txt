sheldon_cooper Here's the problem with teleportation.
leonard_hofstadter Lay it on me.
sheldon_cooper Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.
leonard_hofstadter How about that.
sheldon_cooper Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper No, he would be exactly the same.
leonard_hofstadter That is a problem.
sheldon_cooper So, you see it too.
dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 Gablehouser.
dr_eric_gablehouser Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here.
leonard_hofstadter Graduate work, very impressive.
dr_eric_gablehouser And he's only fifteen years old.
sheldon_cooper Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.
dennis_kim Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea.
leonard_hofstadter Advantage Kim.
dr_eric_gablehouser I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
dennis_kim I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.
dennis_kim Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.
dr_eric_gablehouser Dennis, we discussed this, we're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.
leonard_hofstadter Yes sir.
sheldon_cooper You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.
dennis_kim I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition ... ooh, look, chocolate milk.
sheldon_cooper I sense a disturbance in the force.
leonard_hofstadter A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.
leonard_hofstadter So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.
dennis_kim A year and a half.
leonard_hofstadter No kidding, you speak English really well.
dennis_kim So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
dennis_kim That.
sheldon_cooper He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.
dennis_kim Is this part of the tour?
sheldon_cooper Nope. Goodbye.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.
sheldon_cooper Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.
dennis_kim Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
sheldon_cooper Keen observation, goodbye.
dennis_kim You see where you went wrong, don't you?
sheldon_cooper Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Huh, yeah?
sheldon_cooper Get him out.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec center, they've got nautilus equipment.
dennis_kim Do I look like I lift weights.
leonard_hofstadter Not heavy ones.
dennis_kim It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
sheldon_cooper You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it?
dennis_kim Have you considered it?
sheldon_cooper Get him out Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.
dennis_kim Wow, you won the Stephenson award.
sheldon_cooper Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.
dennis_kim Really, how old?
sheldon_cooper Fourteen and a half.
dennis_kim You were the youngest person ever to win it.
leonard_hofstadter It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it?
penny Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it? Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh? Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?
penny Sure. Raj, hug Howard.
sheldon_cooper Uh-uh-uh.
leonard_hofstadter Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
sheldon_cooper Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to ... you know, that other guy.
howard_wolowitz Antonio Salieri?
sheldon_cooper Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.
howard_wolowitz You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.
leonard_hofstadter Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.
sheldon_cooper Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.
penny I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?
leonard_hofstadter You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.
penny So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.
sheldon_cooper Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything.
penny I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?
howard_wolowitz We liked Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?
sheldon_cooper Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.
penny You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
sheldon_cooper Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper I've decided you're right. My career is not over.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help.
sheldon_cooper Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
leonard_hofstadter It would blow up.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure?
leonard_hofstadter Pretty sure.
sheldon_cooper Pretty sure's not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.
sheldon_cooper Alright.
leonard_hofstadter Go away.
sheldon_cooper If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, you're name can go first ... I'm going.
howard_wolowitz It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now. Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it. How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?
sheldon_cooper So, this is engineering, huh?
howard_wolowitz I'll talk to you later.
sheldon_cooper Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper I just came by to say hello.
howard_wolowitz I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.
sheldon_cooper Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?
howard_wolowitz A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.
sheldon_cooper Really, how does it work?
howard_wolowitz When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.
sheldon_cooper Uh, huh. So it's a shelf?
howard_wolowitz No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide ... yeah, okay, it's a shelf.
sheldon_cooper Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.
sheldon_cooper And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
howard_wolowitz Go away.
sheldon_cooper Did Leonard tell you to say that?
howard_wolowitz No, I thought of it all by myself.
sheldon_cooper Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.
raj_koothrappali Go away.
sheldon_cooper Curiouser and curiouser.
howard_wolowitz Is he here?
leonard_hofstadter If he were, I wouldn't be.
raj_koothrappali Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me.
leonard_hofstadter Is that even possible?
raj_koothrappali As it turns out, yes.
howard_wolowitz Something's got to be done about him, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
raj_koothrappali Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
howard_wolowitz Then our problem would be solved.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no.
howard_wolowitz We don't have to go that far, there are other means available.
raj_koothrappali We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
howard_wolowitz The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
leonard_hofstadter That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.
howard_wolowitz What about biology?
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, he's fifteen.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.
raj_koothrappali She was sleeping with you?
howard_wolowitz No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. Go away? Hmm. Could it be me?
penny Oh, hey guys, what's up?
howard_wolowitz We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Howard, that's racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick.
raj_koothrappali It's possible she may have misunderstood us.
dr_eric_gablehouser Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?
sheldon_cooper No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.
dr_eric_gablehouser Oh, what are you working on?
sheldon_cooper Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.
dr_eric_gablehouser To what end?
sheldon_cooper You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.
dr_eric_gablehouser Who will come?
sheldon_cooper The Jewish people.
dr_eric_gablehouser What if they don't come.
sheldon_cooper We'll make it nice, put out a spread.
dr_eric_gablehouser Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.
sheldon_cooper Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.
dr_eric_gablehouser Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your ... uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of ... um ... he's nuts.
sheldon_cooper Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize ...
sheldon_cooper I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?
professor_goldfarb Go away.
sheldon_cooper We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
professor_goldfarb Please go away.
sheldon_cooper Said Pharoah to Moses.
dr_eric_gablehouser Why are all these young women here?
leonard_hofstadter It's take your daughter to work day.
dr_eric_gablehouser Really, I was not aware of that.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.
dr_eric_gablehouser Hm?
howard_wolowitz Smooth.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
dr_eric_gablehouser There's the man of the hour.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.
howard_wolowitz All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.
leonard_hofstadter Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
raj_koothrappali We need a social catalyst.
leonard_hofstadter Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
howard_wolowitz Or can we?
leonard_hofstadter No, we can't.
howard_wolowitz I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't.
sheldon_cooper Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.
raj_koothrappali Okay. How about that one.
howard_wolowitz Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.
raj_koothrappali Are you crying?
howard_wolowitz No, I have allergies.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, how about her?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so not her either. How about her?
howard_wolowitz Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.
leonard_hofstadter I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
raj_koothrappali I can't talk to her, you do it.
leonard_hofstadter I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.
howard_wolowitz Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.
raj_koothrappali You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we're not in India.
raj_koothrappali Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, that was uncalled for.
raj_koothrappali You started it, dude.
dr_eric_gablehouser Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
sheldon_cooper Welcome Dennis Kim.
dr_eric_gablehouser Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.
sheldon_cooper Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
dr_eric_gablehouser And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!
dennis_kim What?
dr_eric_gablehouser Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.
dennis_kim Um, no thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma.
dr_eric_gablehouser Well, uh, well, uh ...
leonard_hofstadter The kid got a girl.
raj_koothrappali Unbelievable.
howard_wolowitz Did anyone see how he did it?
sheldon_cooper Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honored daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.
howard_wolowitz He's back.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, mission accomplished.
raj_koothrappali Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
howard_wolowitz I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.
leonard_hofstadter Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart.
raj_koothrappali Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, let's go with that.
howard_wolowitz Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.
leonard_hofstadter I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman 'you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.'
raj_koothrappali Hey, look at that. It's Dennis Kim.
howard_wolowitz Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.
raj_koothrappali You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we really ruined his life.
sheldon_cooper Screw him, he was weak.
