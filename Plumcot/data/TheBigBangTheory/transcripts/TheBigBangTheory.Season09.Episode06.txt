sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’ve got terrible news.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.
leonard_hofstadter Just tell me.
sheldon_cooper A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, well, that kind of stinks.
sheldon_cooper That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
leonard_hofstadter What are we going to do?
sheldon_cooper Perform the experiment immediately.
leonard_hofstadter I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.
sheldon_cooper A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
leonard_hofstadter That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
sheldon_cooper Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?
barry_kripke Sowwy, there’s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
sheldon_cooper But you won’t need much for that.
barry_kripke Twue, but if it’s successful, I’m having a pawty with bawwoons.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?
barry_kripke Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Not a chance.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?
barry_kripke Hell no.
sheldon_cooper He could’ve softened the blow.
raj_koothrappali Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?
leonard_hofstadter We’d have to go to every Party City in California.
howard_wolowitz Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
raj_koothrappali Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.
howard_wolowitz If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions.
leonard_hofstadter Who is he?
sheldon_cooper Where does he work?
leonard_hofstadter How does he get the helium?
sheldon_cooper How many questions are too many questions?
howard_wolowitz Maybe he’s not for you.
sheldon_cooper Four questions. There answer’s four.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.
penny Oh, good for him.
bernadette_rostenkowski I thought so, too.
penny So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
penny Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.
penny Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.
stuart_bloom What’s up?
bernadette_rostenkowski Can you show us that dating app?
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.
penny Wow. So how many girls have you met?
stuart_bloom Two. I probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero.
penny Well, so how does it work?
stuart_bloom Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?
stuart_bloom First time it happens I will let you know.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.
sheldon_cooper What’s he say?
leonard_hofstadter He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
sheldon_cooper Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?
leonard_hofstadter The man restocking the cereal shelves.
sheldon_cooper That’s right. And what did he do?
leonard_hofstadter He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
sheldon_cooper It’s like it was yesterday.
leonard_hofstadter Do you want liquid helium or not?
sheldon_cooper Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.
leonard_hofstadter Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.
leonard_hofstadter We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.
sheldon_cooper Was she helping him with his research?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. So, are we doing this?
sheldon_cooper Well, but where does he get the helium?
leonard_hofstadter Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?
sheldon_cooper Uh, but this is violating university code.
leonard_hofstadter A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.
sheldon_cooper Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in.
leonard_hofstadter Done.
sheldon_cooper I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
leonard_hofstadter Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.
sheldon_cooper Aren’t you just made of sugar.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not sure how I feel about this.
penny Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.
stuart_bloom One of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.
penny Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute.
bernadette_rostenkowski Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
penny And he’s sad about it.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
penny Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?
howard_wolowitz If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money.
raj_koothrappali What are you guys up to?
bernadette_rostenkowski We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there.
raj_koothrappali Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.
howard_wolowitz What was wrong with that guy?
raj_koothrappali Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I want to try.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?
howard_wolowitz Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?
leonard_hofstadter That must be him.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
maria What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…
sheldon_cooper I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
maria Great. You got the cash?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, uh, right here.
sheldon_cooper Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?
leonard_hofstadter What ya doing, Skippy?
sheldon_cooper Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
maria Oh, how do I know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me?
sheldon_cooper Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
leonard_hofstadter Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists.
sheldon_cooper Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.
maria Yeah, well, from my perspective, that’s how you two appear to me.
sheldon_cooper Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?
leonard_hofstadter My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
maria Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate.
sheldon_cooper Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.
maria Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
maria Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
sheldon_cooper Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.
maria Hmm, I don’t follow.
sheldon_cooper Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.
maria Is that a threat?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it.
maria Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I’ll report you, then I’ll pound your asses into the ground.
sheldon_cooper Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?
leonard_hofstadter Afraid so, Skippy.
sheldon_cooper I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
leonard_hofstadter All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.
maria No, I don’t like this. I’m out.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.
maria Really? What’s the hypothesis?
sheldon_cooper Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
maria Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.
sheldon_cooper And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s the money. Can we do this?
maria Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.
leonard_hofstadter It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.
maria Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there’s, uh, plenty we could do about it.
sheldon_cooper Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?
penny Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?
raj_koothrappali You know he won’t be looking at other girls.
howard_wolowitz Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.
penny Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.
penny Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.
howard_wolowitz I love you, Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?
raj_koothrappali That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
penny Look, it’s Stuart.
raj_koothrappali You may want to leave the room.
sheldon_cooper Right this way, Uncle Harvey.
leonard_hofstadter Will you stop with that already?
sheldon_cooper I’m trying not to attract attention.
leonard_hofstadter And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
sheldon_cooper She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
leonard_hofstadter Let’s just start the experiment.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not getting caught.
sheldon_cooper Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?
leonard_hofstadter The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.
sheldon_cooper Uh-oh.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Well, did you see this sticker?
leonard_hofstadter What is it?
sheldon_cooper It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.
leonard_hofstadter It’s probably USC or UCLA.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
sheldon_cooper That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.
leonard_hofstadter Ma’am.
penny Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull.
raj_koothrappali I have that same underwear.
penny Chug.
penny Amy, you’re getting a text.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, um, give me that.
raj_koothrappali I had a great time last night.
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, stop reading that.
howard_wolowitz Who’s Dave?
penny You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
amy_farrah_fowler No, it, it’s not like that.
bernadette_rostenkowski And I’d love to take you out again”?
all@ Amy/What?/Can’t believe it/Oh, my God.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, it’s like that.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you for coming back.
maria Yeah, well, normally I wouldn’t, but my daughter’s having a sleepover, and there’s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.
sheldon_cooper Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.
maria Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?
leonard_hofstadter No, nothing. We just changed our mind.
sheldon_cooper He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.
maria Yeah, I hear you. Well, you’re good guys, so I’ll, uh, I’ll take the helium off your hands.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
maria But you ain’t getting your money back.
sheldon_cooper You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
maria Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
maria No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand.
leonard_hofstadter He wants more money.
sheldon_cooper Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.
maria That’s exactly how much it is.
sheldon_cooper Finally, something breaks our way.
penny I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?
amy_farrah_fowler Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.
stuart_bloom A few people?
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
penny Amy.
stuart_bloom So, are we allowed to ask how it’s going?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
raj_koothrappali What? I thought we were all… never mind.
bernadette_rostenkowski I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.
penny Well, good for you.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski And how many guys have you gone out with?
stuart_bloom Please be less than two.
amy_farrah_fowler Three.
stuart_bloom Damn it.
sheldon_cooper Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.
leonard_hofstadter Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
sheldon_cooper It scared me straight, Leonard.
barry_kripke Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Barry.
barry_kripke But you have to add my name to your paper.
sheldon_cooper That’s preposterous.
barry_kripke I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me.
leonard_hofstadter Can you give us a minute?
barry_kripke Take your time. I’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.
sheldon_cooper I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
leonard_hofstadter Me neither, but what other choice do we have?
leonard_hofstadter I promise this is the last time.
leonard_hofstadter It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
sheldon_cooper How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
helium_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 They should’ve used among, right?
sheldon_cooper Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.
helium_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?
sheldon_cooper Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
helium_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 I am open to change.
