sheldon And here’s another interesting weather fact.
penny Another? Great.
sheldon Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.
penny Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
sheldon Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
penny You know, I will miss this.
sheldon I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in his absence.
penny I won’t.
sheldon That criticism will come later in your report card.
penny Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna read the report card.
leonard Hello.
penny Leonard! Hi!
leonard Keep your voice down.
penny Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.
leonard We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.
penny Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?
leonard I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.
penny Oh, that is so romantic.
leonard Uh, sure, that’s why I did it.
penny Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.
sheldon Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.
sheldon Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.
stuart Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.
sheldon Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.
stuart Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
sheldon Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart.
stuart Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector.
sheldon I’m a real collector. How rare is it?
stuart Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
sheldon Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.
howard What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind in Spider-Man’s body?
raj Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.
raj Hey, what’s your problem?
howard I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s probably this stupid diet I’m on.
raj Why are you on a diet?
howard I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men’s section.
raj Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
sheldon Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.
stuart All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this.
sheldon Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.
stuart Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare.
sheldon Oh.
leonard And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.
penny Ah.
leonard And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.
penny Oh. Oh, that’s the pizza.
leonard Yep. Here’s some money.
penny Thank you.
leonard And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
penny Hey.
pizza_guy Twenty-two fifty.
penny Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.
pizza_guy Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.
penny Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.
sheldon Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.
penny That’s nice.
sheldon Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
penny Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so…
sheldon Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.
penny Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. Have a good night!
sheldon What, now, do you have company?
penny No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
sheldon Oh, I can take a look at it.
penny Well…
sheldon I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.
penny Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You don’t have to go into the bathroom.
sheldon That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?
penny Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.
sheldon Of course. Ask a silly question.
penny Oh.
sheldon That’s odd.
penny Um, what?
sheldon There are takeout containers in the trash can.
penny So? That’s my dinner from last night.
sheldon What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.
penny Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.
sheldon Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!
penny What?
sheldon Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
penny No.
sheldon Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?
bernadette Hi, honey.
howard Hey.
bernadette I made some brownies. You want one?
howard You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.
bernadette We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not fat.
howard Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of you is lying.
bernadette Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?
howard Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
bernadette Why can’t she do it?
howard ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t take into account the square footage of her back.
bernadette Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
howard I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?
bernadette This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve been wearing gloves.
howard Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
bernadette Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
howard You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.
bernadette That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice riding the dragon.
howard Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.
bernadette It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
howard I feel so stupid. And fat.
bernadette It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?
howard Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to everything.
amy Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.
sheldon Yes, I am.
amy Then what does tweepadock mean?
sheldon Uh, elephant?
amy Lucky guess.
sheldon I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny’s.
amy What happened?
sheldon I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
amy What?
sheldon She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
amy I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
sheldon Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.
amy You’re being ridiculous.
sheldon Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.
amy Poor Leonard.
amy Do you hear anything?
sheldon I hear a woman’s voice.
amy Is it Penny?
sheldon No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.
amy Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.
sheldon There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.
amy Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
sheldon Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act.
amy No, Sheldon, don’t.
sheldon Aha.
penny What the hell?
sheldon Leonard?
penny Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.
sheldon Right. Penny. Penny. Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?
leonard I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.
sheldon Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.
leonard That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
sheldon Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.
penny No, he doesn’t.
leonard I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
sheldon Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.
leonard The what?
sheldon Amy?
amy Please leave me out of this.
sheldon Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
leonard Come on, I said I was sorry.
sheldon No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.
penny It was fine.
leonard Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you wanted. It’s neat, huh?
sheldon You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
leonard I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.
amy Hello, sailor.
penny Ooh, now we’re talking.
sheldon Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
howard Thanks for coming over.
raj No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.
howard Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a brie in the oven.
raj Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?
howard Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?
raj Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.
howard Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.
raj I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.
howard Seriously?
raj Do you want my help or not?
howard Fine.
raj Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.
howard Yeah, they kind of do.
raj Hmm. Uh, let me see something.
howard Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.
raj Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. I mean, yeah, maybe.
howard Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.
raj You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that going for you.
howard You think?
raj Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.
howard Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. Ooh, brie’s ready.
raj Yay.
leonard Good morning.
sheldon Hello.
leonard So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
sheldon I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
leonard Where do you think I would take you?
sheldon Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.
leonard I’m going to work. You can come if you want.
sheldon Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.
leonard No, I don’t.
sheldon Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you’ve ever told me is true.
leonard I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.
sheldon You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?
leonard Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?
sheldon All right, I’ll give you that one.
leonard Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
sheldon I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
leonard Fine. What I did was wrong.
sheldon I wish I could believe you.
leonard You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying.
sheldon You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.
leonard Stop it.
sheldon Keep it up?
leonard Bye.
sheldon Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?
penny Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?
amy Driving Sheldon to work.
penny He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?
amy Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray.
penny I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.
sheldon Thought I heard you out here.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.
penny Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.
sheldon You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?
amy Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…
sheldon Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy.
amy Really?
sheldon Yes. You’re either with me or against me.
amy You want to take the bus to work?
sheldon Maybe there’s a third option.
amy FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.
leonard So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.
howard That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.
sheldon Howard, Raj. Judas.
leonard You know what? You’re a crazy person.
sheldon A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.
howard Stop it.
sheldon Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
howard I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.
raj A little loud, dude.
howard So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?
leonard Okay.
sheldon I suppose so.
howard Thank you.
raj Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.
sheldon And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.
leonard I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.
penny I’m so glad you guys are friends again.
sheldon And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.
penny Aw.
sheldon Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.
penny Fifty cents off Vagisil.
sheldon Think of me when you apply it.
raj Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.
sheldon Yeah.
penny Me, too.
leonard Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?
bernadette Oh, that happened right after you left.
leonard And no one told me?
howard Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.
penny Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
