howard_wolowitz That was close.
raj_koothrappali God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, still funny, Raj.
leonard_hofstadter There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
howard_wolowitz But what about the creek bed?
sheldon_cooper The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.
raj_koothrappali Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed.
sheldon_cooper I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
howard_wolowitz I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.
sheldon_cooper And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
raj_koothrappali We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
leonard_hofstadter I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
raj_koothrappali We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
howard_wolowitz No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
leonard_hofstadter No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.
sheldon_cooper All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t I run away and you cover me?
sheldon_cooper Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!
howard_wolowitz I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!
leslie_winkle Howard, I’m on your team.
howard_wolowitz Oh, Leslie, thank God.
leslie_winkle Where’s the rest of your squad?
howard_wolowitz Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?
leslie_winkle Dead, all of them.
howard_wolowitz Sorry.
leslie_winkle Don’t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn’t listen.
howard_wolowitz Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.
leslie_winkle Hmm, that’s the worst part, the waiting.
howard_wolowitz All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
leslie_winkle Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn’t it?
howard_wolowitz It kind of does.
leslie_winkle I say we make every moment count.
howard_wolowitz I agree. How exactly do we do that?
leonard_hofstadter Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!
howard_wolowitz War is hell.
raj_koothrappali Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, more cutbacks.
sheldon_cooper Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
leonard_hofstadter You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.
leslie_winkle Hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Leslie.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
leslie_winkle Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.
howard_wolowitz That’s great, Leslie. Thanks.
leslie_winkle You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.
raj_koothrappali What was all that about?
howard_wolowitz Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!
sheldon_cooper I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.
leonard_hofstadter Are you done?
sheldon_cooper No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done.
raj_koothrappali You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
leonard_hofstadter What about it, Howard?
howard_wolowitz Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care about that.
howard_wolowitz Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something.
leonard_hofstadter You and Leslie?
howard_wolowitz In the paintball shed! Twice!
sheldon_cooper Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
sheldon_cooper My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
howard_wolowitz Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.
raj_koothrappali And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.
leonard_hofstadter And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
howard_wolowitz Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful.
penny The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
leonard_hofstadter Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
penny How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Penny.
penny Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You’re in my spot.
penny Are you planning on sitting here?
sheldon_cooper No, I’m going to the comic book store.
penny Then what difference does it make?
sheldon_cooper What difference does it make?
leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
sheldon_cooper That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t sit in his spot.
penny Fine. Happy?
sheldon_cooper I’m not unhappy.
penny Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, that should do it.
penny Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
leonard_hofstadter That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
penny Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
penny Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.
leslie_winkle Boy, your heart’s racing. I must’ve really gotten you going.
howard_wolowitz Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
leslie_winkle Sexy.
howard_wolowitz Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
leslie_winkle Satisfactory?
howard_wolowitz That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail.
leslie_winkle Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?
howard_wolowitz Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.
leslie_winkle Isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
howard_wolowitz You know, most people don’t get that.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, I’m home!
howard_wolowitz Oh, great.
debbie_wolowitz Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis’s neck opened up again!
howard_wolowitz I’m busy, Ma!
debbie_wolowitz Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?
howard_wolowitz Don’t come in, Ma!
debbie_wolowitz Why not?
leslie_winkle He’s got company!
howard_wolowitz Oh, there’s the arrhythmia.
debbie_wolowitz Is she Jewish?
howard_wolowitz Are you Jewish?
leslie_winkle No.
howard_wolowitz Yes!
debbie_wolowitz Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
penny You think he’ll notice?
leonard_hofstadter There’s a chance.
penny Oh, what are we gonna do?
leonard_hofstadter We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.
penny Why do we have to tell him I did it?
leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it.
penny Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
leonard_hofstadter Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
penny I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
leonard_hofstadter We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
penny Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.
penny Oh, come on. There, butt print.
leonard_hofstadter It’s too small and too perfect.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome.
penny Shh! Act normal.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
sheldon_cooper Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
leonard_hofstadter Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly.
sheldon_cooper Koothrappali picked me up.
leonard_hofstadter Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
sheldon_cooper They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, friends forgive the little things.
penny You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t you dare, missy.
sheldon_cooper Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
sheldon_cooper I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
sheldon_cooper Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
penny Here we go.
sheldon_cooper That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
leonard_hofstadter Wackadoodle.
howard_wolowitz You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here. Get up. There. Problem solved. Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?
leonard_hofstadter If it were your head, it would be.
penny Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through.
sheldon_cooper You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
penny Why not?
sheldon_cooper Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”
howard_wolowitz Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…
penny His right hand is calling him?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story.
howard_wolowitz I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
leonard_hofstadter I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
howard_wolowitz What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?
penny No. Not at all.
howard_wolowitz Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
howard_wolowitz Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…
leonard_hofstadter Get out.
howard_wolowitz Bye.
leslie_winkle You’re improving.
howard_wolowitz Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
leslie_winkle Hey, listen. Saturday my sister’s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It’s black tie.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not.
leslie_winkle Why not?
howard_wolowitz When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date.
leslie_winkle Oh, all right. I understand.
howard_wolowitz Thanks.
leslie_winkle Hey, I’m really sorry about that Geneva trip.
howard_wolowitz What about it?
leslie_winkle Oh, didn’t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn’t make the cut.
howard_wolowitz When did that happen?
leslie_winkle About 12 seconds ago.
howard_wolowitz Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?
leslie_winkle Actually, I’m trying not to say it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.
leslie_winkle How so?
howard_wolowitz Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
leslie_winkle Well, if I weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I’d be uncomfortable.
howard_wolowitz How so?
leslie_winkle ‘Cause then we’d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.
howard_wolowitz So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.
leslie_winkle No. No, not at all. You’re also arm candy. So? What do you think?
howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!
debbie_wolowitz Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
leonard_hofstadter Why are you crouching there?
sheldon_cooper This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Texas?
penny Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
sheldon_cooper From that key maker, I highly doubt it.
penny Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
sheldon_cooper All right.
penny There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
sheldon_cooper There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
penny Sit on the damn couch.
sheldon_cooper Nope.
penny What do you mean, nope? What’s wrong with it?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him.
penny It’s exactly the same…
leonard_hofstadter Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
sheldon_cooper More?
leonard_hofstadter I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
sheldon_cooper Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
leonard_hofstadter Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
sheldon_cooper What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
leonard_hofstadter Golden Dragon.
sheldon_cooper No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
sheldon_cooper But. Oh, this changes everything.
leonard_hofstadter I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
sheldon_cooper What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
penny You did make that up, right?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God, I wish I had.
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, buddy?
sheldon_cooper I still don’t like this cushion.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.
penny Thanks for the shoes.
leonard_hofstadter Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
howard_wolowitz What’s the plan?
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
sheldon_cooper Right, just one thing before we start.
leonard_hofstadter What is it, Sheldon?
penny What the hell?
sheldon_cooper That was for my cushion.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
penny Screw that.
sheldon_cooper She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
leonard_hofstadter He’s right. You can’t.
sheldon_cooper Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy
howard_wolowitz Okay, see you.
leonard_hofstadter Where are you going?
leslie_winkle Surrender, then Denny’s.
