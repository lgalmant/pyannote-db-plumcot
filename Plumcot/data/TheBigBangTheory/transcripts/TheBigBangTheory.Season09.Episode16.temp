howard Morning.
bernadette Morning.
howard We? What is this?
bernadette I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.
howard Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.
bernadette What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?
howard Are you serious?
bernadette Yeah.
howard Are you sure?
bernadette Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…
howard Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall.
bernadette I know, it’s crazy.
howard It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before.
bernadette Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.
howard But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid.
bernadette I don’t know, Howie.
howard Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
bernadette Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.
howard How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.
leonard Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
sheldon Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?
raj Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
sheldon Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
raj Hey, bud.
leonard Ready to play when you are.
howard Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.
raj If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one.
leonard What’s going on?
howard I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.
leonard What? Congratulations.
raj That’s so amazing.
sheldon Oh, no.
leonard Why oh, no?
sheldon Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?
leonard Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.
sheldon Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?
leonard You’re the other baby.
sheldon Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
leonard Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
sheldon I guess we’ll call this a draw.
bernadette So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…
penny Leonard says you’re pregnant.
amy What?
penny Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?
bernadette I’m pregnant.
penny Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.
amy This is so exciting.
bernadette Yeah, it’s all real exciting.
penny Are, are you not happy about this?
bernadette I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat.
penny No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
bernadette Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.
penny Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.
amy I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
penny Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
bernadette You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
howard I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables.
leonard Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.
howard And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?
sheldon Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.
raj Well, he could bring the baby here.
sheldon Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
howard Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
raj I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
howard A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now.
raj I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
howard This isn’t a joke.
raj I wasn’t joking.
leonard It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.
raj Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
howard You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now.
leonard Hey, you know what we should do?
sheldon All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
leonard Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
amy Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.
penny Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
bernadette Where?
penny Uh, I don’t know, a bar?
bernadette Can’t drink.
penny We can, but all right.
amy Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
bernadette Doctor said I can’t have sushi.
penny Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
bernadette Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.
amy Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?
raj I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…
leonard And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
all Cheers.
howard Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.
sheldon And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
howard If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
leonard There’s no reason you can’t.
howard That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
leonard That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.
sheldon Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
leonard Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
sheldon Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.
howard Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.
leonard How is that a new invention?
howard I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
raj It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
sheldon This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
leonard The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.
sheldon That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?
raj Uh, it’s in the corner.
sheldon Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?
raj I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
leonard Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
howard Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.
raj They have that. It’s called Uber.
howard Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
leonard Yeah. Why?
howard Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
leonard Wow. I’ve never thought about that.
howard And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
raj Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.
leonard You may have actually just come up with something.
howard You think so?
leonard I really do.
sheldon You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.
amy Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
penny Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
bernadette I kind of already do that for Howie.
penny And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
amy Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
bernadette Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
penny Oh, tell us.
amy Yeah, tell us.
bernadette No, I’m embarrassed.
penny Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.
amy Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.
bernadette Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
amy Oh, that sounds juicy.
bernadette Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…
penny Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?
bernadette Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.
amy What?
penny No.
bernadette I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here.
amy How could you do that?
bernadette I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another.
amy I do know what that’s like. I really do.
leonard I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
howard I’m not finding anything either.
raj It’s a good sign.
sheldon Oh, wait, I found something.
howard Damn. What is it?
sheldon This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
leonard Can you focus on what we’re talking about?
sheldon All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
raj Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.
sheldon And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
leonard I’d enjoy that.
sheldon Nah, she’s a good kid.
howard If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
raj Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
leonard I’m telling you, you got this.
howard Maybe you’re right.
sheldon Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
howard Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
bernadette You guys can go in if you want.
penny No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in.
amy Then why are we drinking?
penny Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right? Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
bernadette That sounds fun.
amy Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.
penny What’s it say?
amy Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
bernadette How is that a drunk text?
amy He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.
raj Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.
leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
raj Just bust a move,
leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
raj Just bust a move,
leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
penny Hey, guys. Congratulations.
howard Thank you.
amy Hi. How are you doing?
sheldon Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
howard I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?
bernadette Sure.
penny So, you gonna get up there later?
sheldon A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.
howard I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared.
bernadette It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.
howard Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it.
bernadette Me, too.
howard I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
penny Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.
amy We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?
penny Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.
amy My first love broke my heart for the first time.
together And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you’d always be mine.
howard Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’.
raj Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.
leonard Ah, push it.
bernadette I appreciate this, but you really…
leonard Push it real good.
sheldon Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.
howard I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me.
sheldon You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
howard Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.
penny That was such a fun night.
leonard Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
penny Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
leonard Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
penny Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
leonard Me, too. So, you ever think about it?
penny Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?
leonard I think we’d make amazing parents.
sheldon Will you guys keep it down?
penny On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
