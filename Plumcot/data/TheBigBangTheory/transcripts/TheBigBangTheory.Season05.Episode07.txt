sheldon_cooper And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.
ghostly_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Sheldon, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.
ghostly_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
raj_koothrappali You should’ve seen your face.
sheldon_cooper Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.
howard_wolowitz Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me.
raj_koothrappali He’s probably right.
howard_wolowitz We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen. .
howard_wolowitz Who had money on faints?
raj_koothrappali I had pee his pants.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
sheldon_cooper Droll.
leonard_hofstadter That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
sheldon_cooper Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.
stuart_bloom Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!
raj_koothrappali What is she doing in a comic book store?
stuart_bloom I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.
hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Hi.
stuart_bloom Um… it-it-it… Shut up.
hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Are you getting this Next Men?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.
hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.
leonard_hofstadter Leonard.
alice You are very cute, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.
alice No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.
alice Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?
alice Alice.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.
alice Later.
howard_wolowitz Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
stuart_bloom ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.
stuart_bloom Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend.
sheldon_cooper Be sure to check the mail.
leonard_hofstadter How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
sheldon_cooper Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
leonard_hofstadter Right.
penny Hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
penny Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
sheldon_cooper Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.
leonard_hofstadter Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
sheldon_cooper Open the mail!
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. A couple of circulars, nothing important.
penny What’s with him?
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.
leonard_hofstadter Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
alice What are you wearing?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.
alice Wow, you must have gotten so laid.
leonard_hofstadter No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
alice Want to see a comic I draw?
leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. You have your own book?
alice Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.
leonard_hofstadter Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
alice You’d think, but no.
leonard_hofstadter You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do…
alice So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?
leonard_hofstadter You can have my car.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.
raj_koothrappali Good morning, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.
raj_koothrappali You have a thing of paper clips right there.
sheldon_cooper well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Maybe.
sheldon_cooper Be a lamb and check.
raj_koothrappali All right. Who do we have here?
sheldon_cooper It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
raj_koothrappali Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
sheldon_cooper Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
raj_koothrappali Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
sheldon_cooper I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.
penny It’s open.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you got a minute?
penny Yeah, sure, come on in.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
penny Want some mac and cheese?
leonard_hofstadter No. Lactose. Gas.
penny Glass of wine?
leonard_hofstadter No. Sulfites. Migraines.
penny Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we used to go out, right?
penny Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.
leonard_hofstadter I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.
penny All right, what’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter So, you’re okay talking about this?
penny Yes.
leonard_hofstadter You’re sure it’s not weird.
penny It’s okay.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.
penny Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
penny Yeah, probably.
leonard_hofstadter Come on.
penny I’m sorry, go ahead.
leonard_hofstadter I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.
penny Did you guys do it?
leonard_hofstadter No. We just made out a little.
penny Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
penny That’s gross.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
penny Well, good for you.
leonard_hofstadter The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.
penny So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s not who I am.
penny All right, then break it off with the new girl.
leonard_hofstadter Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.
penny If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?
leonard_hofstadter Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
penny Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.
leonard_hofstadter Now we’re getting somewhere.
penny What does your gut tell you?
leonard_hofstadter Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. Perfect.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Science. You wouldn’t understand.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, well, see you. I’m going out.
sheldon_cooper I thought you were leaving the apartment.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind.
sheldon_cooper Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
leonard_hofstadter No. I’m having a moral crisis.
sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.
sheldon_cooper All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.
leonard_hofstadter Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
sheldon_cooper You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.
leonard_hofstadter That actually does help.
sheldon_cooper It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
leonard_hofstadter Screw it, I’m going.
sheldon_cooper On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
leonard_hofstadter Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
sheldon_cooper Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Great. Tropicana, no pulp.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Sheldon.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who is it?
sheldon_cooper It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper Really? That’s very unsettling.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hi.
howard_wolowitz What’s up?
sheldon_cooper It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.
howard_wolowitz Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?
sheldon_cooper Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
howard_wolowitz Whatever. My… oh… it’s…
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
sheldon_cooper It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
sheldon_cooper Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
bernadette_rostenkowski This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.
sheldon_cooper We are?
bernadette_rostenkowski You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no! I can’t!
bernadette_rostenkowski Hurry! We’re running out of time!
sheldon_cooper Okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just do it!
sheldon_cooper Oh, God! One, two, three!
howard_wolowitz Trick or treat, bubbeleh.
sheldon_cooper What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… .
leonard_hofstadter Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this.
alice Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to.
alice But?
leonard_hofstadter But I kind of have a girlfriend.
alice Are you kidding?
leonard_hofstadter You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?
alice I don’t believe this.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, I don’t, which part?
alice I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.
leonard_hofstadter It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Priya.
priya_koothrappali Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
priya_koothrappali Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.
priya_koothrappali Leonard, relax. It’s okay.
leonard_hofstadter It is?
priya_koothrappali Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?
priya_koothrappali Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, kind of?
priya_koothrappali A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
priya_koothrappali Well, it’s not a competition.
leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this.
sheldon_cooper Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even.
