sheldon_cooper I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not the best Best Western I’ve been to, but I’d say it’s the third best Best Western I’ve been to.
sheldon_cooper I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
amy_farrah_fowler What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
sheldon_cooper Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, well, I should unpack.
sheldon_cooper All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
amy_farrah_fowler I will. I wish you were here.
sheldon_cooper At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I’m glad you’re not here?
sheldon_cooper Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.
amy_farrah_fowler Good-bye, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means I’m available to be entertained, hmm. As today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?
howard_wolowitz Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
sheldon_cooper That sounds awful. Raj?
raj_koothrappali Uh, I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me.
sheldon_cooper That’s the one to beat. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off.
sheldon_cooper Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.
raj_koothrappali Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
sheldon_cooper Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
leonard_hofstadter How was your day?
penny Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo.
sheldon_cooper A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes.
penny I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months.
leonard_hofstadter Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?
penny Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know.
howard_wolowitz What kind of doctor is she?
penny Um, a psychiatrist. Why?
howard_wolowitz Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her.
penny Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
raj_koothrappali Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
penny That’s interesting.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
raj_koothrappali Low self-esteem.
howard_wolowitz Social anxiety.
sheldon_cooper Sexual insecurity.
leonard_hofstadter None of that is true.
penny Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
leonard_hofstadter That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
penny I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug.
leonard_hofstadter What if I get caught?
howard_wolowitz Fear of failure.
raj_koothrappali Lack of confidence.
sheldon_cooper Kind of a wuss.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, I’ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.
penny Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Pushover.
howard_wolowitz Spineless.
sheldon_cooper Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
howard_wolowitz That was incredible.
bernadette_rostenkowski It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.
howard_wolowitz I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.
stuart_bloom You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?
howard_wolowitz What is it, Stuart?
stuart_bloom Can I come in?
howard_wolowitz Hang on. Should I send him away?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s okay.
stuart_bloom Thanks, Bernie.
howard_wolowitz What’s up?
stuart_bloom Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I’d make it easy on you guys and find my own place.
howard_wolowitz Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, when are you thinking of moving?
stuart_bloom Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?
stuart_bloom Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re very welcome.
stuart_bloom Hmm.
howard_wolowitz What?
stuart_bloom Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you’re awake.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
raj_koothrappali Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. What are you doing now?
raj_koothrappali Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I see. How about now?
raj_koothrappali Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
sheldon_cooper Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.
raj_koothrappali Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
sheldon_cooper Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
sheldon_cooper Found one.
raj_koothrappali No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.
sheldon_cooper But, look, an optical transient.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?
sheldon_cooper It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
dr_gallo Ah, it’s my pleasure. I’m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?
dr_gallo No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.
leonard_hofstadter Well, then you know her better than I do.
dr_gallo Well, I’m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?
dr_gallo Well, I didn’t want to say it.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.
dr_gallo Sounds like you’re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now.
dr_gallo Mm. Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?
dr_gallo That’s heartbreaking.
leonard_hofstadter Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.
howard_wolowitz You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.
stuart_bloom Boy, who would’ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I’d still be here two years later?
howard_wolowitz No one.
bernadette_rostenkowski Nobody thought that.
stuart_bloom Well, that’s it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess so.
stuart_bloom This is weird.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.
stuart_bloom It’s okay. I know he loves me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in.
stuart_bloom I will. And I really can’t thank you guys enough.
bernadette_rostenkowski Our pleasure.
stuart_bloom Bye.
bernadette_rostenkowski Goodbye.
howard_wolowitz He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.
raj_koothrappali It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
sheldon_cooper Maybe it’s a new planet.
raj_koothrappali Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.
sheldon_cooper Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy.
raj_koothrappali Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
sheldon_cooper Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.
raj_koothrappali A medium-sized asteroid.
sheldon_cooper That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
raj_koothrappali I kind of like chicken fingers.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.
raj_koothrappali Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
sheldon_cooper I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
raj_koothrappali You dream different than me.
sheldon_cooper It is kind of cute.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.
sheldon_cooper We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
penny Hey, how’d it go?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…
penny Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.
penny You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
leonard_hofstadter All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.
penny Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.
leonard_hofstadter So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
penny I guess.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.
bernadette_rostenkowski Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?
howard_wolowitz No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?
howard_wolowitz Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why can’t it be a woman cave?
howard_wolowitz As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m being serious.
howard_wolowitz Well, what do you think we should do?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.
howard_wolowitz Oh. He was so excited.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.
howard_wolowitz I’ll give it to him next time I see him.
bernadette_rostenkowski Have you heard from him since he left?
howard_wolowitz No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.
howard_wolowitz Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?
howard_wolowitz Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
bernadette_rostenkowski And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.
howard_wolowitz That was pretty cute.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!
raj_koothrappali So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
sheldon_cooper That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.
raj_koothrappali How is that both our names?
sheldon_cooper Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?
sheldon_cooper Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.
leonard_hofstadter Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.
raj_koothrappali I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.
sheldon_cooper Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.
raj_koothrappali Wait, what happened to us?
sheldon_cooper Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what are you thinking of naming it?
sheldon_cooper I haven’t settled on anything yet.
raj_koothrappali We haven’t settled on anything yet.
sheldon_cooper All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.
leonard_hofstadter You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
raj_koothrappali That is a great idea.
sheldon_cooper It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.
raj_koothrappali So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?
sheldon_cooper I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.
raj_koothrappali That’s just Amy.
sheldon_cooper Exactly. See how well we work together?
penny And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.
dr_gallo Got it.
penny Uh, do you have any questions?
dr_gallo Just one.
penny Mm-hmm?
dr_gallo When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?
penny I just meant a question about the drug.
dr_gallo Yeah, I know what you meant. Let’s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.
penny I don’t wanna.
dr_gallo Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he’s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?
penny You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?
sheldon_cooper Good news. You’re an asteroid.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, please tell me what to say next.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?
sheldon_cooper Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.
amy_farrah_fowler All of them?
sheldon_cooper Even the girls.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I think I know what to say now.
penny How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?
dr_gallo I went to college in the ’70s. It was a hairier time. I’m gonna say yes.
penny You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.
dr_gallo Hmm.
penny And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
dr_gallo Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn’t sure if he was real.
penny Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.
dr_gallo Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.
penny I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.
dr_gallo Oh, I’m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.
penny Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.
amy_farrah_fowler I miss you.
sheldon_cooper I miss you as well.
howard_wolowitz I can’t believe I miss Stuart.
penny I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
girls#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
leonard_hofstadter Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.
girls#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
stuart_bloom I really miss this.
