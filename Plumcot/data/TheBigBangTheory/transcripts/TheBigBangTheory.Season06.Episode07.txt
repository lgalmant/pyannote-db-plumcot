wil_wheaton Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m happy to be here.
amy_farrah_fowler Cut.
sheldon_cooper What’s wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.
wil_wheaton Wooden?
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.
sheldon_cooper My friend, Wil Wheaton.
wil_wheaton Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to be here.
sheldon_cooper So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
wil_wheaton Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what’s interesting about this flag…
amy_farrah_fowler Cut.
wil_wheaton What was wrong with that?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s called Fun with Flags. They’re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let’s try and keep it upbeat.
wil_wheaton Um, no offence, but I’ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
sheldon_cooper It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.
amy_farrah_fowler You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.
wil_wheaton So do I.
amy_farrah_fowler Great. So, this time let’s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.
wil_wheaton And cut. You realize that I’m doing this for free, right?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action.
sheldon_cooper So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
wil_wheaton Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
amy_farrah_fowler Cut.
wil_wheaton Problem, first-time director?
sheldon_cooper Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.
amy_farrah_fowler He was overacting on purpose.
sheldon_cooper Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
wil_wheaton Listen, Sheldon, I’m really happy to do this for you, but not if she’s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.
amy_farrah_fowler You gonna let him speak to me like that?
sheldon_cooper Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. What do you think?
amy_farrah_fowler Can I speak to you for a second?
sheldon_cooper I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.
sheldon_cooper Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.
amy_farrah_fowler Fine. Then maybe I should go.
sheldon_cooper Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?
amy_farrah_fowler You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
sheldon_cooper Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.
bernadette_rostenkowski Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.
howard_wolowitz Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
bernadette_rostenkowski You ready to go?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.
howard_wolowitz What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?
bernadette_rostenkowski 50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.
howard_wolowitz You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because we don’t live here.
howard_wolowitz I know.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.
howard_wolowitz That’s not true.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, I’m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?
howard_wolowitz There’s some underwear in the hamper.
debbie_wolowitz Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.
howard_wolowitz Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
howard_wolowitz The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
bernadette_rostenkowski Or in the closet. We can decide later.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, help, my hand’s stuck in the garbage disposal.
howard_wolowitz Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.
debbie_wolowitz Are you kidding? It’s a perfectly good chicken leg.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.
sheldon_cooper I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you had plans with Amy.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
leonard_hofstadter Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
sheldon_cooper Yes, quite the kerfuffle.
leonard_hofstadter Then Amy got mad and left?
sheldon_cooper Walked right out the door.
leonard_hofstadter And you?
sheldon_cooper Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
sheldon_cooper Why’s that?
leonard_hofstadter Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.
sheldon_cooper You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
leonard_hofstadter Trust me, call her.
sheldon_cooper Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
sheldon_cooper You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m mad at you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.
sheldon_cooper Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?
leonard_hofstadter Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.
sheldon_cooper Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.
penny Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.
bernadette_rostenkowski Kitchen slammed again?
penny No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?
bernadette_rostenkowski So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?
howard_wolowitz Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s your excuse this time?
howard_wolowitz No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.
bernadette_rostenkowski That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
howard_wolowitz My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, you promised you’d move.
howard_wolowitz And I will.
penny Yeah, right.
howard_wolowitz I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.
penny I’ve seen her burp you.
howard_wolowitz She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?
penny Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m starting to think you’re right.
howard_wolowitz All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.
penny Wow, excuse me.
howard_wolowitz That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Angry Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
sheldon_cooper I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.
amy_farrah_fowler Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
sheldon_cooper First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy… She’s hooked.
raj_koothrappali Wow. An end of an era.
howard_wolowitz Boy, if these walls could talk.
leonard_hofstadter They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.
howard_wolowitz I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.
raj_koothrappali When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
howard_wolowitz Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
howard_wolowitz Fine, let’s go.
penny Hey. What brings you in?
sheldon_cooper Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls.
penny I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
sheldon_cooper Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
penny And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.
penny You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
sheldon_cooper Will that calm my nerves?
penny It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
sheldon_cooper Sold.
penny Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
sheldon_cooper The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.
penny Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.
sheldon_cooper It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.
penny Honey, you can’t make people like each other.
sheldon_cooper Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.
penny You might want to pace yourself.
sheldon_cooper I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.
penny Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
sheldon_cooper My problem is I’m out of tea.
penny Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
sheldon_cooper Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
penny Sorry.
sheldon_cooper On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.
penny Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
sheldon_cooper Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.
penny Yeah, that she is. Here you go.
sheldon_cooper I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.
penny No, she won’t.
sheldon_cooper No, she won’t. I’m great.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I’ll see naked in the bathroom.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know this wasn’t easy. You doing okay?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman.
howard_wolowitz I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
howard_wolowitz She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s lucky you were there.
howard_wolowitz You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, crap. Let’s go.
howard_wolowitz Where we going?
bernadette_rostenkowski Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.
howard_wolowitz No, but I want to live here.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.
howard_wolowitz Can’t we talk about this?
bernadette_rostenkowski No husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!
sheldon_cooper Wil Wheaton! Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?
wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon, what’s up?
sheldon_cooper Wouldn’t you like to know?
wil_wheaton Have you been drinking?
sheldon_cooper Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.
wil_wheaton Why are you here?
sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?
wil_wheaton Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
sheldon_cooper You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
wil_wheaton Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we’re gonna fight?
sheldon_cooper My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.
wil_wheaton Okay, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
wil_wheaton Are you okay?
sheldon_cooper You’re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I’ll choose. You were so good in Stand by Me.
sheldon_cooper Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.
levar_burton Hey, Sheldon, it’s a pleasure to be here. Well, we’ve got some interesting flags for…
amy_farrah_fowler Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend.
levar_burton Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?
