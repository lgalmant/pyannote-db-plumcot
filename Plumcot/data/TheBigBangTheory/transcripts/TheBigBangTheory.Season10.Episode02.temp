sheldon Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
leonard So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
sheldon Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game.
howard All right, we got a problem.
leonard What’s up?
howard The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.
leonard Really?
raj Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.
sheldon Oh, what did he say?
raj He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
sheldon That doesn’t sound terrifying.
raj To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.
leonard You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.
howard And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially.
leonard There goes our big payday.
howard I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed.
leonard You do that, too?
howard Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?
sheldon Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?
raj Well, you’re kidding, right?
sheldon Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?
howard Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.
sheldon Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?
bernadette I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck.
penny All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.
bernadette He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
penny You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.
amy Does that help?
penny Well, for a while. Then he comes back.
bernadette I don’t believe this.
amy What’s wrong?
bernadette This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
amy You did already know, right?
bernadette No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
penny No. You told me not to.
bernadette I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great.
amy Why don’t you want anyone to know?
bernadette ‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else.
penny Would they really do that?
bernadette I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.
raj Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
leonard Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.
raj Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.
howard You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.
leonard That’s not a bad idea.
raj Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.
howard Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?
raj My cousin does work in a call centre.
howard And my cousin’s a lawyer.
sheldon We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me.
leonard You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all.
sheldon I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
leonard That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
sheldon Or in German, a Besserwisser.
penny How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
bernadette I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
amy Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
bernadette From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.
amy Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you.
bernadette Thanks. You guys are the best.
penny Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!
amy What?
penny I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…
bernadette I forgot my coat.
penny Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.
amy Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.
penny Is that really what’s important right now?
amy I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up.
penny That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that.
amy I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.
howard Give me a second to call my cousin.
sheldon I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
howard First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy.
howards_cousin Hello.
howard Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.
marty Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.
howard Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.
leonard Hi.
sheldon Hello.
howard And this is my friend, Raj.
raj Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office.
leonard I saw it. It’s big.
howard Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?
marty Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything.
sheldon Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?
marty That’s not what I meant.
sheldon That’s what you said.
marty That’s not what I meant.
sheldon This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say.
marty Howard, why is he yelling at me?
howard Marty, let me call you back.
leonard Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me.
sheldon You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.
penny Hi.
bernadette Hey. What brings you by?
penny Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.
bernadette Oh. How was it?
penny Great.
bernadette Fell asleep?
penny In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?
bernadette I’m furious.
penny Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?
bernadette No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about.
penny Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.
bernadette It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
penny Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.
bernadette What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.
penny Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.
bernadette Why did you do that?
penny Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.
bernadette Get out.
penny Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.
sheldon I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.
leonard ‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people.
sheldon Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
leonard I’m getting enraged.
sheldon Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
howard No.
leonard Don’t speak.
sheldons_phone Aw, nuts.
colonel_williams Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.
leonard Hi.
howard Hello.
colonel_williams So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?
howard It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.
sheldon
colonel_williams And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?
leonard Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.
colonel_williams Well, I’m a scientist by training.
howard Really? You’re a physicist?
colonel_williams Better. I’m an engineer.
leonard Where did you go to school?
colonel_williams MIT.
howard Oh. Well, hey, me, too.
colonel_williams I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I’ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there’s an application for this technology, and we’re interested in funding your research.
howard Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons.
colonel_williams Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.
leonard I don’t know how I feel about this.
colonel_williams Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big.
leonard That’s a lot less big.
colonel_williams Yes, it’s this much less big.
howard I’m not even sure that’s possible.
colonel_williams Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.
howard Four months?
sheldon Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.
amy Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.
bernadette Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.
amy I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
bernadette Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
amy Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?
bernadette I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing.
amy You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?
bernadette Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy
amy I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.
bernadette I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant.
amy I understand how you feel.
bernadette Thank you.
amy I wish there were some way I could make it better.
bernadette Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start.
amy Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant.
bernadette Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?
amy I’ll be right back.
bernadette And a chocolate shake.
penny Hi.
sheldon Hello.
penny What are you doing?
sheldon Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars.
penny Does he even like lemon bars?
sheldon Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.
penny Something happen at the meeting?
sheldon They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.
penny And you talked?
sheldon Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me.
penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too.
sheldon Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.
penny Why would that make me feel better?
sheldon Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
penny Okay. Never mind.
sheldon Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.
penny Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know.
sheldon Why would you do that?
penny Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.
sheldon See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.
raj Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
howard Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
leonard Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.
howard I love your French toast.
leonard Oh, thanks, man.
raj So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?
howard We didn’t. Sheldon did.
raj And you just let him?
leonard Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.
howard No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.
raj So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
leonard Oh, looks like it.
raj Wow. You’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.
howard Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.
raj And right here.
howard You are a deeply silly man.
raj He is so afraid of his feelings.
penny Oh, hi.
bernadette Got a minute?
penny Yeah, come on in.
bernadette I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
penny Oh, thank you, and I’m sorry I lied about it.
bernadette For what it’s worth, you’re a great liar.
penny Oh, that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?
bernadette Well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and I’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury.
penny You threatened to sue?
bernadette Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch.
penny That’s funny. I learned something totally different.
bernadette Do you know what? It’s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It’s all I need to give my life meaning.
penny Oh, that’s so beautiful.
bernadette You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I’ll have the jury eating out of my hand.
sheldon I never realized this building was classified.
howard Maybe that’s because it’s classified.
leonard Wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.
sheldon The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing.
leonard I’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
sheldon Why? It clearly doesn’t work.
howard I guess this is it.
leonard Is that a retinal scanner?
howard Let’s find out.
scanner Howard Wolowitz, access granted.
leonard No way.
sheldon Impressive.
leonard Oh, my turn, my turn.
scanner Leonard Hofstadter, access granted.
leonard I didn’t even have to take my glasses off/
scanner Access denied.
leonard_and_sheldon It knows.
howard Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.
scanner Howard Wolowitz, access granted.
all Yay.
