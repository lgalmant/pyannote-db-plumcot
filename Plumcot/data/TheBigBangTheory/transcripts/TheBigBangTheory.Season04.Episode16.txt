howard_wolowitz What’s so funny?
bernadette_rostenkowski Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
howard_wolowitz I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t I?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
howard_wolowitz You know it’s meant as a compliment.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s how I take it.
howard_wolowitz This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me too.
howard_wolowitz Well, gotta go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?
howard_wolowitz Well, I’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.
bernadette_rostenkowski Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.
howard_wolowitz It’s not just the wig. It’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It’s a two-person job.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.
howard_wolowitz Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?
bernadette_rostenkowski Stay.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?
bernadette_rostenkowski Go home.
howard_wolowitz Your call.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, have you ever considered us living together?
howard_wolowitz Boy, I don’t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.
howard_wolowitz I’ve got a better solution.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great.
howard_wolowitz Look at us planning a future together.
debbie_wolowitz Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
howard_wolowitz Sex criminals don’t have keys, Ma.
debbie_wolowitz Where were you so late?
howard_wolowitz I was out with Bernadette.
debbie_wolowitz I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!
howard_wolowitz I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!
debbie_wolowitz God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!
howard_wolowitz Nobody has a disease!
debbie_wolowitz I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?
howard_wolowitz That’s it. I don’t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
debbie_wolowitz Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
howard_wolowitz I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, what’s up?
howard_wolowitz I need a place to crash.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure. Why?
howard_wolowitz Big fight with my mother.
leonard_hofstadter Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
howard_wolowitz No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
sheldon_cooper Did you offer him a hot beverage?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.
howard_wolowitz Tea does sound nice.
sheldon_cooper You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?
howard_wolowitz There’s no room. His sister is staying with him.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait. What?
sheldon_cooper Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here.
leonard_hofstadter Priya’s in town?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…
leonard_hofstadter Hold on. When did Priya get here?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn’t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust Bernadette.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye.
sheldon_cooper Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.
howard_wolowitz That’s not really necessary.
sheldon_cooper No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you.
howard_wolowitz Thanks.
sheldon_cooper That’s what tertiary friends are for.
raj_koothrappali Who is it?
leonard_hofstadter It’s Leonard.
raj_koothrappali You can’t come in.
leonard_hofstadter I just want to talk to her.
raj_koothrappali I forbid it.
priya_koothrappali Open the door, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali You heard me. I forbidded it.
priya_koothrappali Forbidded it?
raj_koothrappali Forbaded it?
priya_koothrappali Get out of the way. What are you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
priya_koothrappali I have business in Los Angeles.
leonard_hofstadter Why didn’t you call?
raj_koothrappali Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.
priya_koothrappali I’m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn’t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.
leonard_hofstadter I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
raj_koothrappali No!
priya_koothrappali Sure.
raj_koothrappali It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation! Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
sheldon_cooper Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
howard_wolowitz That’s very nice of you, but I made other plans.
sheldon_cooper Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.
priya_koothrappali Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
raj_koothrappali Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
priya_koothrappali Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.
leonard_hofstadter The word is forbade.
raj_koothrappali Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
priya_koothrappali Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t have a relationship with.
sheldon_cooper Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
raj_koothrappali There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.
priya_koothrappali I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.
raj_koothrappali Some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. My point is, you can’t go out with Leonard.
penny Who can’t go out with Leonard?
raj_koothrappali My sister.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya.
priya_koothrappali It’s very nice to meet you.
penny Oh, yeah, you, too.
sheldon_cooper Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.
penny Sheldon!
leonard_hofstadter Really?
howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
raj_koothrappali Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
howard_wolowitz Listen, my mom’s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That’s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?
howard_wolowitz Isn’t that great?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.
howard_wolowitz Oh, uh…
bernadette_rostenkowski Wrong answer.
howard_wolowitz No, wait. You didn’t let me finish.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m listening.
howard_wolowitz Uh…
bernadette_rostenkowski Agh!
amy_farrah_fowler I came as quickly as I could.
penny Okay. Why?
amy_farrah_fowler To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.
penny Amy, I’m fine.
amy_farrah_fowler You don’t have to be strong for me. Now let’s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.
penny Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
penny Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.
penny Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?
amy_farrah_fowler This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?
howard_wolowitz I choose you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really?
howard_wolowitz Yep. I moved out of my mother’s house. Cord is cut. I’m all yours.
bernadette_rostenkowski What did she say when you told her?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. She hasn’t responded to my email yet.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is so great. I love you, Howard.
howard_wolowitz I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house.
howard_wolowitz That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
leonard_hofstadter I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.
priya_koothrappali I’d love that.
leonard_hofstadter I love the way you say, I’d love that.
raj_koothrappali She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
priya_koothrappali Rajesh, don’t be a child.
raj_koothrappali I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.
leonard_hofstadter My sister’s 38 and married.
raj_koothrappali All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
penny Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.
sheldon_cooper That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports.
priya_koothrappali Hi. Penny, right?
penny Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose.
sheldon_cooper No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.
penny If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn’t have to take that.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, bestie.
penny Hi. So, um, Priya, you’re a lawyer, right?
priya_koothrappali I know. Pretty boring, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?
priya_koothrappali Thank you, Leonard. That doesn’t make it sound boring at all.
amy_farrah_fowler So, how you holding up?
penny I’m fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, who are you kidding? She’s breathtaking.
priya_koothrappali So, Penny, Leonard tells me you’re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.
penny Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
sheldon_cooper Did you get the part?
penny I didn’t do the audition.
sheldon_cooper Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?
priya_koothrappali I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
priya_koothrappali In his tongue.
leonard_hofstadter Whose tongue?
priya_koothrappali Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.
leonard_hofstadter What, with my tongue in your tail?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow.
howard_wolowitz Wow, indeed.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t believe we’re finally living together.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz A little snack. You got any string cheese?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. I, I might have some cheddar.
howard_wolowitz Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
howard_wolowitz You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
howard_wolowitz Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?
howard_wolowitz Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist.
bernadette_rostenkowski I have to take you?
howard_wolowitz You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
howard_wolowitz It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t believe this.
howard_wolowitz What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother.
howard_wolowitz Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?
debbie_wolowitz Who’s that? Is it a sex criminal?
howard_wolowitz Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.
debbie_wolowitz Where were you?
howard_wolowitz Didn’t you read my email?
debbie_wolowitz You know I can’t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
debbie_wolowitz Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!
penny Oh, hey. What’s up?
amy_farrah_fowler I just wanted to check in on you.
penny Why?
amy_farrah_fowler It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.
penny I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased that Leonard has found someone that makes him so happy.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s okay, it’s okay.
penny Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.
penny Okay.
penny I smell Chinese food.
sheldon_cooper It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
penny Are Leonard and Priya here?
sheldon_cooper They went to Catalina for the weekend.
penny Oh. Where’s Raj?
sheldon_cooper At home, forbidding it.
penny How about Howard?
sheldon_cooper I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
penny Oh, okay. Well, I guess it’s just the two of us, huh?
sheldon_cooper Actually, it’s the three of us.
amy_farrah_fowler What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.
penny Great.
amy_farrah_fowler So, you feeling better?
penny Not really.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset.
sheldon_cooper Right. I’ll make tea.
penny Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. I don’t want tea.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
