bernadette What you doing?
howard You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.
bernadette You can’t just throw everything in the closet.
howard Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.
bernadette What if someone looks in there?
howard They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.
bernadette Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
howard Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
bernadette Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
howard You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
bernadette Why?
howard Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.
bernadette He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet.
howard No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
howard Hey, guys, come on in.
all Hi.
penny Ooh, it smells good.
bernadette Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
sheldon Oh, you shouldn’t have.
bernadette Oh, it’s my pleasure.
sheldon No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.
bernadette You stopped and got him takeout?
leonard I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
bernadette Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.
sheldon Well, now don’t you feel silly.
bernadette Show him the closet.
raj These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.
bernadette That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.
raj Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.
sheldon Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
howard Colour’s fine.
sheldon Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.
penny Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
amy Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
sheldon Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
amy His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
leonard Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.
sheldon Oh, five more minutes.
leonard That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.
sheldon How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
howard You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
sheldon Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.
leonard Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
sheldon Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
howard Juggle.
sheldon You health nuts kill me.
bernadette Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
sheldon Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
howard Whoa, you opened this?
sheldon Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
howard I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home.
bernadette Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?
howard If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.
sheldon Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
howard Do whatever you want.
sheldon Thanks. Oh. Great party.
leonard You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.
penny What is your point?
leonard Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
penny Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
leonard Trying to paint a picture.
penny It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
leonard Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
penny Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
leonard Yeah. Although…
penny No.
bernadette Howie, you okay?
howard Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
bernadette Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it.
howard It’s this stupid letter.
bernadette Did you read it?
howard No.
bernadette You must be curious.
howard Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?
bernadette Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
howard He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
bernadette I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?
howard Something I should have done a long time ago.
bernadette Really? Are you sure?
howard Yep.
bernadette Feel better?
howard I do. Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
amy I can’t believe he set it on fire.
bernadette Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
amy Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.
bernadette Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.
amy Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?
bernadette I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
penny What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
bermadette That works.
penny Okay.
sheldon Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
amy You have something we want.
sheldon Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
penny No, we just want information.
sheldon Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.
penny We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
sheldon I did.
penny What did it say?
sheldon I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
amy Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.
sheldon Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.
penny Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
sheldon Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.
penny Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?
sheldon Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
penny Yeah, obviously.
sheldon Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.
raj Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
leonard Actually, all I did was invite you.
raj Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
leonard I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.
raj So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
leonard Hey, where have you been?
sheldon Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
leonard One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.
sheldon Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.
leonard What information?
sheldon I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
raj Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.
sheldon Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
leonard Fine, then that.
sheldon All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.
amy This is really fun.
raj Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.
penny Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.
leonard As is the company.
penny Aw.
sheldon My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
leonard Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
raj Of course.
penny Sure.
amy Absolutely.
sheldon If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
howard Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
bernadette Yeah, try doing it in heels.
howard I am.
bernadette Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.
howard What?
bernadette I know what was in your dad’s letter.
howard Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.
amy Hey.
bernadette I made him tell us.
howard What? Us? Who else knows?
penny I know.
amy Me, too.
leonard Same here.
raj Shame on all of you.
leonard You know, too.
raj Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?
howard So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
sheldon Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.
howard How could you do this?
bernadette I’m sorry.
raj If you want, we could tell you.
howard No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.
amy Use me as a human shield!
sheldon I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
bernadette Howard?
howard In here.
bernadette I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.
howard It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
bernadette What are you looking at?
howard Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
bernadette That’s nice.
howard I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.
bernadette Think you could take a break?
howard Why?
bernadette Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
howard Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?
leonard When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
howard Oh, yeah, what’s that?
sheldon It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
penny We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…
sheldon Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
penny Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it.
bernadette Sit down, honey.
leonard Raj, you’re up.
raj Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
howard Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.
amy Told you.
sheldon Don’t.
leonard Amy.
amy You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.
howard Really?
sheldon Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
leonard Penny.
penny It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
sheldon I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.
amy No, it’s not.
sheldon Don’t.
leonard Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
howard Hmm.
leonard Bernadette.
bernadette Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?
howard Yeah. I’m terrific.
leonard So, which one do you think it is, matey?
howard Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true.
leonard Well, one of them is.
howard That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.
penny Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?
raj Yeah,
leonard Yeah, cool.
amy Okay.
sheldon You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.
bernadette Sheldon, don’t you dare.
sheldon There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.
bernadette That’s more like it.
sheldon Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
bernadette Glad you’re feeling better.
howard Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
penny This turned out pretty well, huh?
leonard Yeah, I think so.
raj I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.
amy If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.
sheldon Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?
penny Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
sheldon Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
penny Party’s over! Party’s over!
