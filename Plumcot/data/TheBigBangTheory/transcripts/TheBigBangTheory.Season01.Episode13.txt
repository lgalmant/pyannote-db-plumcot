howard_wolowitz Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth.
raj_koothrappali I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.
sheldon_cooper Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.
leonard_hofstadter Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.
howard_wolowitz Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
raj_koothrappali How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.
penny Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going 'aaaaaaa'.
leonard_hofstadter What did you spill on it?
penny Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.
leonard_hofstadter I'll take a look at it.
howard_wolowitz Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year.
leonard_hofstadter You're kidding, why not?
howard_wolowitz They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm.
penny Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys.
howard_wolowitz Recognize.
leonard_hofstadter This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.
penny Zod?
howard_wolowitz Kryptonian villain. Long story.
raj_koothrappali Good story.
sheldon_cooper Well count me out.
howard_wolowitz What? Why?
sheldon_cooper You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
leonard_hofstadter Come on, you need a four person team, we're four people.
sheldon_cooper By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.
penny I want tickets to that please.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you.
sheldon_cooper No, don't.
leonard_hofstadter The needs of the many.
howard_wolowitz Outweigh the needs of the few.
sheldon_cooper Or the one. Dammit, I'll do it.
raj_koothrappali Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
howard_wolowitz How about the perpetual motion squad? It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.
leonard_hofstadter The ladies?
howard_wolowitz Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.
raj_koothrappali I like it.
sheldon_cooper I don't. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.
raj_koothrappali Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
sheldon_cooper Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.
raj_koothrappali Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
leonard_hofstadter Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour...
sheldon_cooper Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.
leonard_hofstadter Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
sheldon_cooper I will yield.
leonard_hofstadter After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?
sheldon_cooper He does.
leonard_hofstadter I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?
penny Good afternoon, and welcome to today's physics bowl practice round. I'm Penny, and I'll be your host, because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Of course.
howard_wolowitz Fire away.
penny You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.
penny Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.
leonard_hofstadter I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.
penny Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.
sheldon_cooper And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.
penny That is correct.
leonard_hofstadter I knew that too.
penny Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.
sheldon_cooper And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.
penny Right.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I buzzed in.
sheldon_cooper But I answered, it's called teamwork.
howard_wolowitz Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
sheldon_cooper By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.
leonard_hofstadter Just ask another one.
penny Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging?
sheldon_cooper And of course it's Gravity Probe B.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
sheldon_cooper Why?
penny Because it's polite.
sheldon_cooper What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
penny Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.
sheldon_cooper The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn't I give them?
howard_wolowitz Some of us might have the correct answers too.
sheldon_cooper Oh please, you don't even have a PhD.
howard_wolowitz Alright, that's it.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, sit down.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
leonard_hofstadter maybe we should take a little break.
sheldon_cooper Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.
howard_wolowitz I agree.
penny What did he say?
howard_wolowitz He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.
penny Yeah, and the bag it came in.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.
leonard_hofstadter Can it wait, I need to talk to you.
sheldon_cooper Just look. I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colors are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.
leonard_hofstadter Why do they say AA?
sheldon_cooper Army Ants.
leonard_hofstadter Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
sheldon_cooper Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminum?
leonard_hofstadter No, I meant... never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!
sheldon_cooper Oh neat, what's the occasion?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team.
sheldon_cooper What?
leonard_hofstadter Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.
sheldon_cooper No you didn't.
leonard_hofstadter Yes we did, I just came from it.
sheldon_cooper Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team.
sheldon_cooper Why?
leonard_hofstadter Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
sheldon_cooper Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.
sheldon_cooper I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks for the heads up.
sheldon_cooper You're welcome. One more thing.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper It's on, bitch.
howard_wolowitz So who'd he get to be on his team.
leonard_hofstadter He won't say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.
raj_koothrappali He's using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.
leonard_hofstadter How exactly would that laugh go?
raj_koothrappali Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
howard_wolowitz That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.
howard_wolowitz So?
leonard_hofstadter So nothing, let's destroy him.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen.
raj_koothrappali Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
howard_wolowitz Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team.
raj_koothrappali You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.
leonard_hofstadter Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team.
raj_koothrappali How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
howard_wolowitz Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems.
leonard_hofstadter We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
raj_koothrappali Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
howard_wolowitz Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Sack up, dude.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.
leslie_winkle Hi guys.
leonard_hofstadter Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I...
howard_wolowitz Hit that thang.
leslie_winkle Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.
leonard_hofstadter There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.
leslie_winkle Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.
leonard_hofstadter That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.
leslie_winkle Proceed.
leonard_hofstadter We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
leslie_winkle No thanks, I'm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.
howard_wolowitz Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you.
leslie_winkle Sorry.
howard_wolowitz Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano.
leslie_winkle Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
leslie_winkle That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?
leonard_hofstadter She's in.
penny So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? Are you ready?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing.
penny Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
penny Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down.
leonard_hofstadter So, is that your team.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
leslie_winkle Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Leslie Winkle?
leslie_winkle Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?
sheldon_cooper Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.
leslie_winkle Oh, ouch.
dr_eric_gablehauser Okay, if everyone could please take your seats.
leonard_hofstadter Here's your tee-shirt.
leslie_winkle PMS? It's a couple of days early, but...
leonard_hofstadter No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.
leslie_winkle Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?
dr_eric_gablehauser Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year's physics bowl. Today's preliminary match features two great teams... AA versus PMS.
howard_wolowitz All night long, y'all!
dr_eric_gablehauser Okay, well let's jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson? PMS?
leonard_hofstadter The Eta Meson.
dr_eric_gablehauser Correct.
sheldon_cooper Formal protest.
dr_eric_gablehauser On what grounds?
sheldon_cooper The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
dr_eric_gablehauser Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope. AA?
sheldon_cooper And of course, the answer is Technetium.
dr_eric_gablehauser Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation. PMS?
raj_koothrappali Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.
dr_eric_gablehauser Correct.
dr_eric_gablehauser How does a quantum computer factor large numbers. PMS?
leslie_winkle Shor's Algorithm.
dr_eric_gablehauser Correct.
sheldon_cooper 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
leonard_hofstadter Prevost's theory of exchanges.
sheldon_cooper Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
howard_wolowitz 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.
dr_eric_gablehauser Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning.
sheldon_cooper A sigma particle.
leslie_winkle Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.
dr_eric_gablehauser Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation.
raj_koothrappali Holy crap.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell is that.
howard_wolowitz It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, think, Leslie.
leslie_winkle Leonard, it's not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.
leonard_hofstadter You're never going to let that go, are you?
dr_eric_gablehauser Ten seconds. PMS.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, I panicked.
howard_wolowitz Then guess.
leonard_hofstadter Um, eight. Point four.
dr_eric_gablehauser I'm sorry, that's incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.
howard_wolowitz He doesn't have it. He's got squat.
dr_eric_gablehauser AA, I need your answer.
third_floor_janitor#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 The answer is minus eight by alpha.
sheldon_cooper Hang on, hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?
third_floor_janitor#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 Answering question. Winning physics bowl.
sheldon_cooper How do you know anything about physics?
third_floor_janitor#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.
sheldon_cooper Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.
third_floor_janitor#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 You didn't answer question.
sheldon_cooper Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!
dr_eric_gablehauser AA, I need your official answer.
sheldon_cooper Well it's not what he said.
dr_eric_gablehauser Then what is it?
sheldon_cooper I want a different question.
dr_eric_gablehauser You can't have a different question.
sheldon_cooper Formal protest.
dr_eric_gablehauser Denied.
sheldon_cooper Informal protest.
dr_eric_gablehauser Denied. I need your official answer.
sheldon_cooper No. I decline to provide one.
dr_eric_gablehauser Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.
sheldon_cooper That's your opinion.
dr_eric_gablehauser Alright, the winner of the match is...
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.
sheldon_cooper I don't understand the question.
leonard_hofstadter Go ahead.
dr_eric_gablehauser The winner is PMS!
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, somebody's sitting there.
sheldon_cooper Who?
leonard_hofstadter My Physics Bowl Trophy!
sheldon_cooper That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win.
leonard_hofstadter I know someone who would disagree.
sheldon_cooper Who?
leonard_hofstadter My Physics Bowl Trophy! 'Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?'
sheldon_cooper Alright that is very immature.
leonard_hofstadter You're right, I'm sorry. I'm not!
penny Okay, new contest.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
penny I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?
sheldon_cooper Absolutely.
leonard_hofstadter Bring it on.
penny Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family? The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?
sheldon_cooper The Brady Bunch?
penny Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum. Oh my God, Sean Penn!
leonard_hofstadter How do you know these things?
penny I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?
sheldon_cooper William Shatner.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.
sheldon_cooper Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Formal protest.
penny Alright, singer who sang 'Oops I Did It Again.' Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?
sheldon_cooper Romulan.
penny Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.
