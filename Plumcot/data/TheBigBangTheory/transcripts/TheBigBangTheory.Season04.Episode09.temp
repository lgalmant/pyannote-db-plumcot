raj You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
howard You want to talk brave, how about Captain America’s undocumented Mexican gardener?
leonard He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
sheldon As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
howard How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
sheldon Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.
leonard I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
raj Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
howard That’s a stupid question.
raj We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
man Yes?
leonard Oh, um, is Penny here?
man You’re Leonard, right?
leonard Yeah.
man Damn, it’s good to finally meet you, son.
leonard Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.
penny Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.
leonard Oh, good. Context.
pennys_dad Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.
penny Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I’ll see you later. Bye.
leonard That was odd.
sheldon Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.
raj Is that racist? It feels racist.
howard Don’t be oversensitive. He’s calling you illiterate, not your race.
raj Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
sheldon I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.
howard Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.
leonard You’ll never guess what just happened.
sheldon You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
leonard No.
sheldon Aw.
leonard Penny kissed me.
sheldon Well, who would ever guess that?
raj What… what kind of a kiss?
leonard A big kiss. On the mouth.
howard Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
leonard She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.
leonard You think?
howard Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
leonard Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
sheldon Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
leonard I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.
howard Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits.
raj Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.
leonard Why do I bother talking to you people?
sheldon If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.
penny Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?
leonard Yeah, sure.
sheldon I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
penny So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
leonard What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.
penny Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.
leonard What? Why?
penny Well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.
leonard What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
penny Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.
leonard Really? How, how’d we manage that?
penny What?
leonard Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
penny Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
leonard Yeah, no, I don’t think so.
penny Okay, why are you arguing about this?
leonard I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened.
penny Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?
leonard Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that.
pennys_dad Penny, you out here?
penny Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.
pennys_dad Relax, I’ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.
leonard See? He doesn’t mind.
pennys_dad So, Leonard, I’m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?
penny Oh, dad, that’s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?
leonard Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.
penny Oh.
leonard Come here, you.
howard C-7.
raj Miss.
howard How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.
raj Not if it has a hole in the middle.
howard What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
raj A Romulan battle bagel?
bernadette Knock-knock.
howard Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.
bernadette So where’s the telescope?
howard It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.
bernadette So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?
howard I did it with you when we rented The Notebook. Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear.
raj Excuse me. I can’t be drinking, I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here.
howard What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
raj How do you know that?
howard Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption.
raj Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
howard Oh, I, I’m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.
raj Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
howard Yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.
raj I do appreciate that.
bernadette Here we go.
howard Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
bernadette Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead.
howard What?
bernadette Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.
leonard Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.
pennys_dad My pleasure. It’s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny’s that knows how to use a napkin.
penny So not funny, dad.
wyatt Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.
penny Oh, will you please let it go?
wyatt Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.
leonard A lot of people are doing that.
penny Oh, see?
wyatt Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom’s Camry.
penny Yeah, that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on.
wyatt And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?
penny Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking.
wyatt I don’t know. That petition looked real to me.
penny Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
wyatt Well, I’m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.
leonard Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper.
wyatt Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?
penny Oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.
leonard Maybe I could go in a little late.
penny No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important.
wyatt Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won’t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?
leonard Don’t I know it.
wyatt Well, good night, son.
leonard Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.
penny Good night.
leonard I love you.
penny Love you, too.
sheldon Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.
howard Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can’t go any further. There’s a sacred cow in my way.
raj Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
bernadette It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.
raj Yeah. Like his haircut material.
bernadette Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?
raj No. I got them all cut.
bernadette Which is still so funny.
raj And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
bernadette Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
howard Okay, I think that’s enough about me.
raj He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!
bernadette Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!
leonard Coming. Hey, lovebug.
penny Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?
leonard Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?
penny Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
leonard You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful.
penny Why are you making this so difficult?
leonard It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
penny Leonard.
leonard What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
penny No.
leonard Well, then, what do you want?
penny I don’t know.
leonard Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
penny Maybe.
sheldon Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits.
penny Oh, my God. What personal habits?
leonard I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.
penny Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…
leonard Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
sheldon Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
penny No, you’re right. No, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
sheldon Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.
leonard Fines?
sheldon Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.
raj Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!
howard It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
bernadette Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?
raj Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion.
bernadette That sounds great.
raj It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.
howard We’d come visit you.
raj No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.
bernadette He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?
howard Hold on. He could come back.
raj Oh, what’s the point of everything?
howard Nope. He’s gone.
raj You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
howard What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
raj Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.
bernadette Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you.
raj Where?
bernadette You just have to look.
howard No!
bernadette Well, this was fun.
wyatt Oh! I think I got a nibble.
leonard Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.
wyatt Oh, look at that baby. They’re really biting, huh?
leonard Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
wyatt Oh, that’s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn’t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we’re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.
leonard Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.
wyatt That’s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing’s bull squirt, huh? Well, that’s very disappointing. Bye.
leonard Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you.
wyatt I can’t believe you would lie to me like that.
leonard Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.
wyatt I’ll get to you in a minute.
leonard No hurry.
wyatt That my own daughter thinks I don’t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.
penny I’m sorry, daddy…
wyatt Let me finish.
penny Oh.
wyatt I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?
penny You know, I’m sorry.
wyatt You’re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.
penny You’re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.
wyatt Thank you. Now, why don’t you go and put some clothes on and we’ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.
penny Daddy, he had nothing to do…
wyatt Keep walking.
penny Okay.
wyatt Please, please, please don’t give up on her.
leonard What?
wyatt I can’t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.
leonard Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir.
wyatt Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don’t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.
leonard I’ll give it a shot.
wyatt Thank you. Now I’m going to do something here to help you along.
leonard Excuse me?
wyatt Just don’t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!
leonard Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.
wyatt Don’t yap. Just get out.
leonard I’ll friend you on Facebook.
sheldon Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.
leonard Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
sheldon Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?
raj Hey.
leonard Oh, how’d it go last night?
raj Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.
leonard Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
raj Why? You writing a book?
sheldon I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.
raj Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
sheldon That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
howard Hey.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
howard Hey.
raj Hey.
leonard You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
howard Whoa. Where did that come from?
raj He never touched my telescope.
howard Way to go shutting up.
raj I did shut up. Now you shut up.
howard Fine.
raj Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
