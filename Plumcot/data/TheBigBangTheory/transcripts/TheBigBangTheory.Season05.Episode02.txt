sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
sheldon_cooper It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
leonard_hofstadter Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
sheldon_cooper All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?
leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t sound like mocking.
sheldon_cooper You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Why?
sheldon_cooper Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
leonard_hofstadter Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.
sheldon_cooper As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good.
sheldon_cooper Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.
leonard_hofstadter A hobby?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
leonard_hofstadter You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
sheldon_cooper When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
leonard_hofstadter You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
sheldon_cooper Don’t you like Amy?
leonard_hofstadter Of course I like Amy.
sheldon_cooper Well, there’s the difference.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, that’s Priya.
priya_koothrappali Hi, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, honey.
priya_koothrappali I miss you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I miss you, too.
sheldon_cooper I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
sheldon_cooper Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
penny Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.
sheldon_cooper If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
penny I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
sheldon_cooper A good wife would go to the store.
penny I want a divorce.
sheldon_cooper Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.
penny It’s great, isn’t it?
sheldon_cooper It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.
penny What name?
sheldon_cooper Chair.
penny Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.
sheldon_cooper What?
penny Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
penny What is wrong?
sheldon_cooper I’ve been sitting in garbage!
penny Sheldon, take it easy.
sheldon_cooper You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
penny I went into this marriage with so much hope.
sheldon_cooper There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
raj_koothrappali This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
howard_wolowitz Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.
leonard_hofstadter That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
howard_wolowitz Hang on.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
howard_wolowitz Hand me the tuna melt.
leonard_hofstadter Yep.
howard_wolowitz Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
leonard_hofstadter Not easy, but we’re making it work.
howard_wolowitz When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.
raj_koothrappali Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.
leonard_hofstadter There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
howard_wolowitz Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t do that.
howard_wolowitz Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.
raj_koothrappali How can you be so racist?
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.
leonard_hofstadter I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.
howard_wolowitz Just his head, right?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
sheldon_cooper Name one time I’ve ever done that.
leonard_hofstadter How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
sheldon_cooper I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Yello.
sheldon_cooper You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
penny Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
sheldon_cooper Really?
penny Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
sheldon_cooper It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
penny Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper All right. It is a comfortable chair.
penny Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
sheldon_cooper No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.
leonard_hofstadter It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s up, buttercup?
sheldon_cooper You have to get rid of the chair.
penny Nope.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s the word, hummingbird?
sheldon_cooper For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s the gist, physicist?
sheldon_cooper Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. . Penny. Penny. Penny.
leonard_hofstadter So, here we are. Back in bed together.
priya_koothrappali Yep, here we are.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.
priya_koothrappali All right.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?
priya_koothrappali What?
leonard_hofstadter Not good?
priya_koothrappali That’s terrible. Try again.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?
priya_koothrappali Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!
priya_koothrappali God, Leonard, stop talking.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
priya_koothrappali Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, like usual. Good.
priya_koothrappali Take off your shirt.
leonard_hofstadter All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
priya_koothrappali I said be quiet.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, ma’am.
priya_koothrappali Now take off your shorts.
leonard_hofstadter Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!
priya_koothrappali Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.
leonard_hofstadter Cool. Uh-oh!
priya_koothrappali Here I am, baby. You miss these?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, damn it!
priya_koothrappali Oh, Leonard! Already?
leonard_hofstadter No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.
priya_koothrappali Fine.
leonard_hofstadter So, how are your mom and dad?
priya_koothrappali Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Sure, sure.
sheldon_cooper If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.
leonard_hofstadter Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
amy_farrah_fowler Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
sheldon_cooper Is not. Is not, is not.
amy_farrah_fowler Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
sheldon_cooper No.
amy_farrah_fowler How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…
sheldon_cooper No.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?
sheldon_cooper You’re good friends with Penny, right?
amy_farrah_fowler Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.
sheldon_cooper I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
amy_farrah_fowler For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?
sheldon_cooper Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, I am.
sheldon_cooper Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.
sheldon_cooper All right, name your price.
amy_farrah_fowler Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.
sheldon_cooper You mean like Salt Lake City?
amy_farrah_fowler Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Will you listen to me play my harp now?
sheldon_cooper No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know about this, Howard.
howard_wolowitz What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. Give it a try.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think so.
raj_koothrappali I’ll try it. Like this?
howard_wolowitz Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.
raj_koothrappali Like this?
howard_wolowitz Close. Really French it.
raj_koothrappali Better?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, you got it, you got it.
raj_koothrappali I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
howard_wolowitz Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
raj_koothrappali I, I nibbled. I was being playful.
howard_wolowitz Why do you have to make everything weird?
raj_koothrappali Sorry. Better?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah.
penny Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.
amy_farrah_fowler I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
penny You’re kidding.
amy_farrah_fowler Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
penny And now me.
amy_farrah_fowler I just have one question about the chair.
penny And what’s that?
amy_farrah_fowler Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
penny No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
amy_farrah_fowler No, he didn’t.
penny Really?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, he did. He absolutely did.
penny My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.
amy_farrah_fowler It is?
penny Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.
penny I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!
penny What’s wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!
penny Wait. Get up, get up! Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!
amy_farrah_fowler I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!
penny Yeah, sure!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.
priya_koothrappali Oh, Leonard, listen…
leonard_hofstadter No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
priya_koothrappali Leonard…
leonard_hofstadter That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.
priya_koothrappali My parents are here.
dr_vm_koothrappali Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.
howard_wolowitz Check it out. Free chair.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
howard_wolowitz On three?
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 Three!
raj_koothrappali What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
