sheldon_cooper Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.
leonard_hofstadter Since when do you hum songs?
sheldon_cooper What are you talking about?
leonard_hofstadter You were just humming.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
leonard_hofstadter How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
sheldon_cooper Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?
leonard_hofstadter Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?
sheldon_cooper Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
sheldon_cooper I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it. My country, ’tis of thee. No.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.
sheldon_cooper Okay. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
leonard_hofstadter Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
sheldon_cooper I’m surprised you have to ask.
sheldon_cooper Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.
leonard_hofstadter Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.
penny Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me.
penny I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself.
sheldon_cooper I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.
penny Public nudity?
leonard_hofstadter Eh, that just means going barefoot.
dave_gibbs Hello?
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy.
dave_gibbs Oh. How are you?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m fine. How are you?
dave_gibbs Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.
dave_gibbs So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime.
dave_gibbs Yes, please.
amy_farrah_fowler Great.
dave_gibbs Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.
amy_farrah_fowler How ’bout Saturday?
dave_gibbs Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?
howard_wolowitz Really? Why?
raj_koothrappali They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
howard_wolowitz Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?
raj_koothrappali Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…
howard_wolowitz Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?
raj_koothrappali It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.
howard_wolowitz That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.
raj_koothrappali But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
howard_wolowitz All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together.
raj_koothrappali So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
howard_wolowitz We did raise the roof that night.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, we totally did.
howard_wolowitz Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
sheldon_cooper Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
leonard_hofstadter Put on some headphones.
sheldon_cooper No they make my earlobes sweat.
penny Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?
sheldon_cooper There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.
penny Okay, great. What is it?
sheldon_cooper I’ll show you. Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait. Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
penny I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
sheldon_cooper This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, you’re really going out with Dave again?
amy_farrah_fowler Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.
bernadette_rostenkowski But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. So where’s he taking you?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. That’s a big step.
amy_farrah_fowler It is?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.
bernadette_rostenkowski You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?
amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.
raj_koothrappali Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
howard_wolowitz What should we write?
raj_koothrappali How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.
howard_wolowitz Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.
raj_koothrappali Well what do you want to write?
howard_wolowitz Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.
raj_koothrappali Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now.
howard_wolowitz I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.
raj_koothrappali Okay. I posted it.
howard_wolowitz So, who is this guy?
raj_koothrappali Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.
howard_wolowitz Cool name.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too.
howard_wolowitz Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.
raj_koothrappali He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
penny Oh, my God, he won’t stop.
leonard_hofstadter How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
penny Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?
leonard_hofstadter Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
penny Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
leonard_hofstadter What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.
penny Fine.
leonard_hofstadter I love you.
penny Who cares?
sheldon_cooper What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?
penny Problem solved.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.
sheldon_cooper Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, can we please get back to work?
sheldon_cooper This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.
leonard_hofstadter All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, he’s drinking it.
howard_wolowitz Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
raj_koothrappali That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s Trent?
howard_wolowitz Oh, he’s our fan.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fan of what?
howard_wolowitz Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.
bernadette_rostenkowski You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
howard_wolowitz And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
raj_koothrappali Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.
howard_wolowitz Really? You want to go down there and meet him?
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.
raj_koothrappali It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.
howard_wolowitz After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.
raj_koothrappali From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.
howard_wolowitz So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe I should marry Trent.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, like she could get Trent.
dave_gibbs This is delicious.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
dave_gibbs Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.
amy_farrah_fowler When you were married, did your wife cook?
dave_gibbs Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.
amy_farrah_fowler So, a little silver lining.
dave_gibbs I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know.
dave_gibbs I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.
dave_gibbs Had to or got to? Sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler My fault. I brought him up.
dave_gibbs Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?
sheldon_cooper Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?
leonard_hofstadter That’s a trick question, right?
sheldon_cooper Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.
penny Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.
leonard_hofstadter Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.
sheldon_cooper Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
penny Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
sheldon_cooper The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.
leonard_hofstadter There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
raj_koothrappali So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?
howard_wolowitz No. Let him spot us.
raj_koothrappali I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
howard_wolowitz Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.
raj_koothrappali And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!
howard_wolowitz I can’t watch.
raj_koothrappali It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.
howard_wolowitz Why is he looking at it?
raj_koothrappali Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?
howard_wolowitz Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.
raj_koothrappali Ooh!
howard_wolowitz Let’s just go.
trent_monaco Hey, aren’t you the guys?
howard_wolowitz Nope.
raj_koothrappali No, never heard of ’em!
sheldon_cooper I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.
penny Do you even like the Beach Boys?
sheldon_cooper They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
leonard_hofstadter Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?
sheldon_cooper Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.
penny Why?
sheldon_cooper It’s about Amy.
penny Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
sheldon_cooper It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”
penny She did soften your life, didn’t she?
sheldon_cooper Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
leonard_hofstadter Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
penny Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.
leonard_hofstadter Aw.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s an interesting tie clip.
dave_gibbs Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.
dave_gibbs Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous.
dave_gibbs Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.
sheldon_cooper Amy? Amy? Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler That’s Sheldon.
dave_gibbs You’re kidding. How’s my hair?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.
sheldon_cooper I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
dave_gibbs If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me.
sheldon_cooper I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?
sheldon_cooper Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler I really want that, too.
sheldon_cooper Good. Because I love you.
amy_farrah_fowler I love you, too.
dave_gibbs Kiss her, you brilliant fool.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’ll let you get back to your date.
amy_farrah_fowler Get back here.
dave_gibbs Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.
