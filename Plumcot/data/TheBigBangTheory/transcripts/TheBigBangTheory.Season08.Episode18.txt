sheldon_cooper Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.
amy_farrah_fowler I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t.
sheldon_cooper Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, let me see.
sheldon_cooper I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.
sheldon_cooper Well, that can’t be right.
amy_farrah_fowler It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
sheldon_cooper All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
amy_farrah_fowler Poor Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
amy_farrah_fowler He might not be.
sheldon_cooper Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.
amy_farrah_fowler Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’d be incensed.
amy_farrah_fowler So you see what I’m getting at?
sheldon_cooper Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Grass is always greener?
amy_farrah_fowler Try again.
sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me.
amy_farrah_fowler Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad.
sheldon_cooper But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.
amy_farrah_fowler Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.
amy_farrah_fowler Exactly.
sheldon_cooper For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.
howard_wolowitz Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
raj_koothrappali Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.
howard_wolowitz Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories.
bernadette_rostenkowski Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
howard_wolowitz Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.
sheldon_cooper Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, your name is on the electric bill.
sheldon_cooper Oh, right. This is a disaster.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.
sheldon_cooper Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
leonard_hofstadter Did they hate it?
sheldon_cooper No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.
leonard_hofstadter So what’s the problem?
sheldon_cooper You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
sheldon_cooper I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, that, that’s not necessary.
sheldon_cooper It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.
leonard_hofstadter Cooper and his team?
sheldon_cooper You should know I had nothing to do with that.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.
sheldon_cooper You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not helping.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable.
howard_wolowitz Stuart, we’re here.
raj_koothrappali It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.
stuart_bloom Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out.
bernadette_rostenkowski What happened?
stuart_bloom I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.
howard_wolowitz Wait, when did it go out?
stuart_bloom In the middle of the night.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, what’s wrong?
howard_wolowitz It’s all defrosting.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay. It’s just food.
howard_wolowitz It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one.
raj_koothrappali Everything okay?
howard_wolowitz No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?
raj_koothrappali You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
bernadette_rostenkowski What should we do?
howard_wolowitz I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.
howard_wolowitz All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love that.
raj_koothrappali Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
penny I mean, who even reads Scientific American?
leonard_hofstadter It’s kind of a big deal.
penny If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?
leonard_hofstadter Can we please just stop talking about it?
penny I’m sorry. What can I do?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing, I’m fine.
penny No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
leonard_hofstadter What are we doing?
penny I am taking you shopping.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
penny My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing.
penny Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
leonard_hofstadter Does it have a camera in it?
penny It does have a camera in it.
leonard_hofstadter Baby’s listening.
sheldon_cooper Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
leonard_hofstadter What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
sheldon_cooper I did.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. What did he say?
sheldon_cooper He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
leonard_hofstadter Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.
penny You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.
penny You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?
leonard_hofstadter If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.
sheldon_cooper Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.
sheldon_cooper All he had was an idea.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that is an important part.
sheldon_cooper Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
amy_farrah_fowler But Leonard’s idea was good.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.
leonard_hofstadter I’m the one who thought of it.
penny Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
penny And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.
sheldon_cooper Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not your fault.
sheldon_cooper Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
amy_farrah_fowler Not your fault.
sheldon_cooper Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, look at that pretty bird.
leonard_hofstadter He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.
penny I know, I know.
leonard_hofstadter I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks.
howard_wolowitz Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did she throw anything away?
howard_wolowitz No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.
howard_wolowitz No, that’s noodle kugel.
raj_koothrappali One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
howard_wolowitz Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
bernadette_rostenkowski You okay?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.
raj_koothrappali You got it.
howard_wolowitz I’m never gonna talk to her again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Should we tell everyone not to come?
howard_wolowitz No. I want to do this.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
raj_koothrappali I’m not making any promises.
stuart_bloom Glad you guys could make it.
leonard_hofstadter Of course.
penny Wow, it looks really pretty in here.
stuart_bloom Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.
leonard_hofstadter So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?
stuart_bloom And there goes the mood.
sheldon_cooper Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.
leonard_hofstadter Subtle.
sheldon_cooper But you got it, right?
howard_wolowitz Hey, guys.
all@ Hey. Hi. Hello.
howard_wolowitz I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.
howard_wolowitz Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you need any help in the kitchen?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.
penny All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, so please behave yourselves.
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
sheldon_cooper Of course.
stuart_bloom So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?
penny This food is amazing.
raj_koothrappali Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.
howard_wolowitz That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.
amy_farrah_fowler All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
sheldon_cooper Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.
penny Oh, so it’s like The View.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.
penny Shut up.
raj_koothrappali I would like to propose a salon topic.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, please do, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
penny Wait, who’s Tor?
raj_koothrappali You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
howard_wolowitz Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
stuart_bloom It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.
amy_farrah_fowler We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
howard_wolowitz I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
penny Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
sheldon_cooper I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.
leonard_hofstadter Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s fine.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
penny Guys.
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
howard_wolowitz Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.
sheldon_cooper Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, please. His mother just died.
leonard_hofstadter You’re being ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, so are you.
penny Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.
leonard_hofstadter Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.
amy_farrah_fowler And girls.
sheldon_cooper Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.
leonard_hofstadter So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
leonard_hofstadter You want some of this? I’ll give you some.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
sheldon_cooper She said my name first, that must kill you.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…
howard_wolowitz You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t hear it.
raj_koothrappali No, not at all.
penny I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
howard_wolowitz It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
sheldon_cooper You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…
penny Shut up.
raj_koothrappali So glad you two are done fighting.
leonard_hofstadter Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.
sheldon_cooper Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
stuart_bloom What’d they say?
amy_farrah_fowler Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
sheldon_cooper They did.
all@ Yay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good news, I found more Tums.
all@ Yay.
