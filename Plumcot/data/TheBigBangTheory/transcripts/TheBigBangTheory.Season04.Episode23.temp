penny Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.
bernadette You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
penny Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
bernadette Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
penny Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person.
bernadette I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
leonard Uh, that’s my water.
sheldon What?
leonard My water. You’re drinking it.
sheldon Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
leonard Yes. It’s my water.
sheldon Well, that’s it then. I’m dead.
leonard Here we go.
sheldon I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.
raj Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.
bernadette You guys ready to order?
sheldon Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.
bernadette I don’t understand.
howard He drank from Leonard’s glass.
sheldon He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
leonard That’s actually my napkin.
sheldon Oh, this is a nightmare!
howard Where are you going?
sheldon To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!
bernadette All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.
priya Is it diet?
bernadette That’s what you ordered.
priya Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?
bernadette Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
howard Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
leonard What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
bernadette He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.
howard I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
priya Howard, you’ve got to tell your mother.
howard Hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?
priya Uh, that’s different. First of all, we’re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.
howard Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
sheldon I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
leonard You all right?
sheldon Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
sheldon Fire demon.
raj Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.
howard Troll master.
raj Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
leonard Water nymph.
raj Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places.
sheldon Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
raj Sorry. Walking tree.
sheldon Last one.
raj I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
howard Okay, the Eagle has landed.
leonard What’s going on?
howard Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
raj Oh, that sounds lovely.
howard Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.
leonard Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
howard You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
raj Sheldon, that’s my water.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord!
leonard That’s not your water.
raj I know.
sheldon Where’s the mouthwash?
raj Where indeed.
howard Ma, I’m home! Where are you?
mrs_wolowitz I’m in the toilet.
howard So, how’d it go?
mrs_wolowitz Too soon to say. I’m not done yet.
howard No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.
mrs_wolowitz Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that’s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.
howard Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?
mrs_wolowitz Oh, sure. Did you know she’s going to school to become a microbiologist?
howard No, she never mentioned it.
mrs_wolowitz I bet she did and you didn’t listen.
howard Yeah, that’s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She’s great, huh?
mrs_wolowitz She’s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
howard That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news.
mrs_wolowitz I hope it’s good news, because I’ve got nothing but disappointment in here!
howard Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma? Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I’m gonna break the door down! Son of a bitch! Ma, help!
penny Hey.
sheldon Hello.
penny Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?
sheldon Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. Did I say something amusing?
penny I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.
sheldon So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
penny My mirth. Classic.
sheldon Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
penny It’s not a big deal, Sheldon. It’s just, ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister, I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
sheldon Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
penny What are you doing at work these days?
sheldon Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.
penny Alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber.
sheldon Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?
penny Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.
leonard Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.
penny Oh, my God! What happened?
leonard I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.
penny Okay.
leonard Sheldon, let’s go!
sheldon To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so.
penny Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going.
sheldon I can’t.
penny Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs.
sheldon Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.
leonard Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.
sheldon I would think he would know that.
penny Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.
sheldon Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel.
howard So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.
bernadette You’re a real hero, Howard.
howard No, I did what any son would do.
penny Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.
howard I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
penny Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car.
howard What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.
leonard So, how is she?
howard They’re running tests. I don’t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
penny What’s the difference?
sheldon A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
penny Thanks for clearing that up.
sheldon Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.
penny Okay, you’re not helping.
sheldon Disagree.
leonard Go sit over there.
sheldon I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner.
leonard Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
howard My family is the history of heart disease. There’s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .
bernadette So it’s probably genetic.
howard Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.
bernadette What?
howard It’s not important.
bernadette Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.
howard You’d think that. But no.
bernadette You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
howard You can’t take that personally.
penny How else is she supposed to take it?
howard What you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I’ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t.
bernadette You mean sexual intercourse?
howard Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.
priya What happened?
bernadette Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.
howard Bernie, wait!
sheldon I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home.
priya Nice of you to come for Howard.
penny Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do.
priya I’m sorry, did I miss something?
penny It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.
priya That’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend.
penny Yeah, tell me about it.
priya You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.
penny You mean when he was little.
priya Not as little as you’d want him to be.
penny You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?
priya Sure. We’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?
leonard I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
raj Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.
leonard What are you talking about?
raj One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
leonard I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
raj Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
leonard No, I do not. You are a mean little man.
raj You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.
howard Bernie, it’s not you. She’s just set in her ways.
bernadette How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
howard It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.
sheldon Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.
howard What’s wrong with the bathroom here?
sheldon Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.
howard Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I’m not taking you home.
sheldon Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?
howard No!
sheldon This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!
doctor Mr. Wolowitz?
howard Is she okay?
doctor It wasn’t a heart attack. She’s awake, she’s resting comfortably. We’re still running a few tests.
howard Can I see her?
doctor Actually, she said, and I quote, she’d like to see the little Catholic girl first.
bernadette Me? Why me?
howard Jews have been asking that for centuries. There’s no real good answer.
bernadette Okay, well, wish me luck.
howard Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Let’s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.
doctor You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
howard Yeah.
doctor Why don’t I write you a prescription for Xanax.
sheldon Finally. Oh, what fresh hell is this?
doctor Wait, you can’t leave here, you’ve been exposed.
sheldon No, I haven’t. It’s all good.
penny You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up.
priya Oh, the poor thing.
penny It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
priya It does, doesn’t it?
penny It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.
sheldon Help me! Come back! Penny!
leonard There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…
raj Like what?
leonard Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her.
raj What do you mean, a show?
leonard Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.
raj Like, to music?
leonard I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
raj So you’d do a striptease?
leonard I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
raj Good, good.
leonard There was one time I put body glitter on.
raj Well, I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
leonard No, she wouldn’t.
raj Your big problem is me telling her.
leonard You really are a mean little man.
priya Oh, God, that’s so true.
penny Yeah, I know, right?
leonard Hey, what took you guys so long?
priya Oh, we were just chatting.
leonard That’s nice. What about?
penny We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
leonard That’s funny.
penny Yeah.
raj What if she wasn’t kidding?
leonard It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
howard Hey, how’d it go?
bernadette You’re a putz. You know what that means?
howard Yeah. Do you?
bernadette Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
howard And are you?
bernadette No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.
howard Well, based on the available evid…
bernadette Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
howard Where are you going?
bermadette To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
howard Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?
sheldon Mountain Elf.
raj He takes the elf from off the shelf.
leonard Hell Hounds.
raj Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
howard Colossal Serpent.
raj I got a colossal serpent right here.
sheldon Must you?
raj Sorry, I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo.
sheldon Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.
howard If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.
