sheldon_cooper The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?
howard_wolowitz I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”
sheldon_cooper Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?
howard_wolowitz Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.
leonard_hofstadter See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.
howard_wolowitz You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
sheldon_cooper You see a dragon.
howard_wolowitz Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?
sheldon_cooper When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?
leonard_hofstadter Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
raj_koothrappali Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
raj_koothrappali No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister.
leonard_hofstadter Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.
raj_koothrappali You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
howard_wolowitz Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas.
raj_koothrappali That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
sheldon_cooper Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble.
amy_farrah_fowler Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions.
penny Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!
bernadette_rostenkowski We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
penny Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.
penny Well, hello? She’s married.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group.
penny Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.
leonard_hofstadter Are we ready to order?
sheldon_cooper One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
howard_wolowitz With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
sheldon_cooper Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.
howard_wolowitz So, what’s for dinner?
sheldon_cooper A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
penny Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?
howard_wolowitz Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.
penny Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please.
sheldon_cooper Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
leonard_hofstadter Do you really want that?
sheldon_cooper That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
raj_koothrappali What’s it thinking about now?
sheldon_cooper Hamburgers and lemonade.
penny Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf.
howard_wolowitz Emily, this is our friend Raj.
penny Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
raj_koothrappali Hi.
howard_wolowitz She says it’s nice to meet you.
raj_koothrappali Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
howard_wolowitz Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.
howard_wolowitz He’ll text you.
raj_koothrappali Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
sheldon_cooper And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!
raj_koothrappali Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t.
howard_wolowitz Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
raj_koothrappali Oh, she’s here.
howard_wolowitz No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late.
raj_koothrappali Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
howard_wolowitz Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?
raj_koothrappali I worked on it all night. Use it.
howard_wolowitz Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent.
raj_koothrappali Then spell it.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know how to spell it.
raj_koothrappali You’re blowing this for me!
howard_wolowitz He likes your eyes.
raj_koothrappali You’re making me sound like a caveman.
howard_wolowitz She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”
raj_koothrappali Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.
howard_wolowitz No.
raj_koothrappali Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.
howard_wolowitz She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
raj_koothrappali Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
raj_koothrappali Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?
howard_wolowitz You really want to ask her that?
raj_koothrappali You’re right. Everyone loves music.
howard_wolowitz She says, do you play an instrument?
raj_koothrappali No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants.
howard_wolowitz Do you hear yourself
raj_koothrappali Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey.
howard_wolowitz I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.
raj_koothrappali What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late.
raj_koothrappali Dude, what is she saying?
howard_wolowitz It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.
raj_koothrappali What? Why?
howard_wolowitz The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!
raj_koothrappali It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.
howard_wolowitz Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.
raj_koothrappali Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?
howard_wolowitz I speak sign language, I don’t read minds.
raj_koothrappali If you were me, would you kiss her?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but I’m a make out king.
raj_koothrappali I was so smooth on that date.
howard_wolowitz You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
raj_koothrappali Whatever, dude. She kissed me.
howard_wolowitz It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.
raj_koothrappali Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
penny Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
howard_wolowitz Why are you still doing this?
sheldon_cooper Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.
leonard_hofstadter You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
sheldon_cooper The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
penny Is Raj out with Emily again?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, every night for the last month.
penny Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper Me neither.
howard_wolowitz Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
penny You’re kidding.
leonard_hofstadter You think she’s taking advantage of him?
penny Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf.
leonard_hofstadter Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
penny Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
leonard_hofstadter Could you tell us?
sheldon_cooper Let’s see. Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.
penny Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
sheldon_cooper Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.
penny What do you mean, vastly wealthy?
sheldon_cooper Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much.
sheldon_cooper No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich.
penny Well, so how much is that?
sheldon_cooper About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
howard_wolowitz What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.
penny Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car.
howard_wolowitz And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
penny What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
howard_wolowitz He’s not going to listen, he’s in love.
sheldon_cooper Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to… stay right here.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.
penny No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.
howard_wolowitz Wow.
penny You’re engaged to my friend.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.
penny I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.
howard_wolowitz Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
penny Hi.
howard_wolowitz Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.
penny Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
howard_wolowitz She says, sure, what about him?
penny Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.
howard_wolowitz Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.
raj_koothrappali I’m so mad at you!
penny Okay, wait…
raj_koothrappali How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
penny We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?
raj_koothrappali I’m hammered.
penny Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
raj_koothrappali The best one I ever had!
penny Okay, come on. You know you can do better.
raj_koothrappali Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman.
penny Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
raj_koothrappali It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
penny I don’t have feelings.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that.
penny He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
raj_koothrappali I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.
dr_vm_koothrappali No, it’s not a nice surprise, it’s a bad surprise.
mrs_koothrappali Penny called us.
raj_koothrappali Penny?
mrs_koothrappali She told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.
dr_vm_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, I’m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.
mrs_koothrappali You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you’re cut off.
raj_koothrappali What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
dr_vm_koothrappali It’s up to you.
raj_koothrappali Well, I choose love.
dr_vm_koothrappali Hah. You’re an idiot. Love doesn’t last. Well, he’s going to find out eventually. Think about it.
raj_koothrappali My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. No, I think we’ll have to return the car. And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.
penny I know, I know.
raj_koothrappali Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
penny Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.
raj_koothrappali Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
penny What? No!
raj_koothrappali Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.
raj_koothrappali Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have sex with you.
howard_wolowitz Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
sheldon_cooper Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.
penny Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready.
howard_wolowitz Thanks for dinner, buddy.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, real big of you.
sheldon_cooper Hurry, hurry, hurry.
penny Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now.
