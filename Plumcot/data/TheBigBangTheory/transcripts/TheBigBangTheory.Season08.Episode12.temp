sheldon What colour would you like to be?
leonard Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it.
sheldon That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.
leonard Blue and yellow make green.
sheldon Well, then it’s settled.
penny Hi. Ready to go?
sheldon Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.
amy Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.
sheldon Oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.
penny Sweetie, you really thought I’d want to do this?
leonard No.
penny Well, did you tell him that?
leonard Yes.
penny Did you say it out loud with words?
leonard No.
penny I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
sheldon Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.
amy I will literally race you to the car.
leonard No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it.
penny No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted.
sheldon You want to be green?
leonard You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into.
penny Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary.
amy Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I’m banished to the kitchen.
penny Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do.
leonard You got it, you girls are in charge.
penny Thank you.
amy Sheldon?
sheldon Fine. Now that we’re not playing, you can be green.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon And since you’re green this time, I can be it next time.
penny All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.
amy I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.
penny All right, well, what do you want to do?
amy There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.
penny Well, that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.
leonard Hang on, why do we have to hate it?
penny Three words, Doctor Who convention.
leonard I did not force you to go to that.
penny You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up.
leonard I wasn’t gonna get beat up.
penny You were, but somehow I held myself back.
sheldon You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
leonard Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
sheldon Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, I’m a problem-solver, it’s what I do.
amy I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
penny Is there any part of your body that’s normal?
raj Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
howard Will you please relax?
raj I can’t take it, dude.
bernadette You okay?
raj No, I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin.
bernadette I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back.
raj I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.
bernadette What’s he talking about?
howard Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.
raj We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
howard Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.
raj Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.
amy Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.
sheldon Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog.
penny How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
amy Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
leonard Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.
sheldon You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
leonard That’s what I was doing.
sheldon Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?
penny All right, keep thinking.
sheldon You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?
leonard Well, yeah.
sheldon Well, then, it’s settled?
amy What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.
penny It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.
sheldon Well, once again, it’s what I do.
raj Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.
howard I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…
raj Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?
howard A story can do two things.
raj Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack.
howard You work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?
bernadette All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack.
raj I can’t stop thinking about it.
bernadette You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens.
raj I know.
howard Maybe you need to do something more productive.
raj Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
howard So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.
raj Yes.
howard The man who crashed his stationary bike.
raj I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.
howard You happy? Now you can relax.
raj What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
leonard This isn’t so bad.
sheldon That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties.
amy You guys comfy? This might take a while.
sheldon I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
penny No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.
sheldon They have a man there who understands my personal style.
penny Bye.
leonard Uh, I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here.
sheldon Oh. Well, that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.
leonard That’s true.
sheldon I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
leonard Sheldon, it’s fine.
sheldon No, it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.
sheldon Let’s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.
leonard Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.
sheldon Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here.
leonard I don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do.
sheldon Oh, that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises.
leonard Look at you, being all mature.
sheldon I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise.
leonard I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?
sheldon All the time.
leonard On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?
sheldon Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you.
leonard That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
sheldon Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.
leonard What? Then. then why don’t you do it?
sheldon Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.
raj Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.
howard I’m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?
raj If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple.
howard Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels.
raj I meant a Hindu temple.
howard Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out.
raj Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
howard You love that movie.
raj Yeah, it’s pretty great.
howard I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
raj Why?
howard Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.
raj Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it.
howard Yeah, but you’re a scientist.
raj So?
howard So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?
raj That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
howard No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons.
raj Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.
howard Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.
raj Actually there’s no proof of that.
howard You believe in your religion, I’ll believe in mine.
amy How’s it going in there?
penny Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?
amy Sure.
penny Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?
amy Yeah, but it’s okay.
penny How is it okay?
amy I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did.
penny Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want.
amy Really?
penny Absolutely. You name it, we’re doing it.
amy Basket weaving at the craft museum.
penny Well, you named it.
sheldon Oh, here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast.
leonard Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
sheldon I wasn’t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.
leonard Because of you, I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak.
sheldon Well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown.
leonard Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.
sheldon Is that true?
leonard Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.
sheldon Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.
leonard You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.
sheldon You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.
leonard Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.
sheldon Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.
leonard Do you mean that?
sheldon Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.
leonard Come on, don’t get upset.
sheldon I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon It’s okay.
leonard I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.
sheldon I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.
leonard Buddy.
penny How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
leonard Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
amy Are you crazy? You know he’s a flight risk.
sheldon That’s exactly what I told him.
penny Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready.
sheldon Well, what if you did it gradually?
leonard All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
sheldon How about one night and I let you whistle?
leonard Okay.
sheldon When I’m not home.
leonard You got it.
sheldon There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.
howard Here we go, my first Hindu temple.
raj You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.
howard Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.
raj All right. Shall we?
howard Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?
raj Like what?
howard Like am I dressed okay?
raj Really? So every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?
howard I know you’re under a lot of pressure, so I’m gonna let that pass.
raj Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us.
howard That’s nice.
raj Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs.
howard Raj.
raj You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
howard Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It’s fine.
raj Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.
leonard I thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun.
penny Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.
amy Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.
sheldon It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China.
amy Very nice.
leonard Yeah, it looks great.
sheldon I saw that.
leonard Well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start.
penny I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.
leonard Yeah, I’m proud of him, too.
sheldon Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
