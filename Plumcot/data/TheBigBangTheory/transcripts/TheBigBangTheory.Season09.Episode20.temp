sheldon It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!
leonard Whatcha doing?
sheldon I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
penny What am I smelling?
sheldon Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.
penny That’s not what the forest smells like.
sheldon Well, how would I know?
leonard Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
sheldon Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
leonard Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
sheldon Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
penny Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?
sheldon You may need this more than I do.
amy Here’s your tea.
sheldon Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
amy You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?
sheldon Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…
penny You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.
leonard Because he’s hitting on you?
penny She.
leonard Oh, good.
penny But I could get her.
amy We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.
sheldon Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.
leonard You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
penny Sure.
amy Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them.
sheldon I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.
penny I’ll see if it’s available.
amy You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.
sheldon Are you trying to manipulate me?
amy Yes.
sheldon Well done, it worked, we’re going.
amy Yay.
bernadette Come on, Raj, give me a bag.
raj No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
howard Hey, where you been?
bernadette Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.
howard Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?
bernadette Yes and yes.
howard I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
bernadette I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.
howard Really?
bernadette Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.
howard Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet.
raj Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think.
howard And it just got weird.
penny Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
leonard Okay, one sec.
penny Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?
leonard I bought a baseball cap.
penny I can see that. What team did you get?
leonard Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.
penny Well, we’ll be in the woods.
sheldon I’m ready to go.
leonard Anything you’d like to say to him?
penny Nice hat, Sheldon.
sheldon Thanks.
leonard Why are you so mean to me?
howard What the hell are you watching?
bernadette Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
howard Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?
bernadette I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
howard All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?
bernadette Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.
howard Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?
bernadette Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.
howard So he can be part of the experience?
bernadette Yeah.
howard I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
bernadette It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up.
penny It’s so cute and rustic up here.
leonard I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.
sheldon Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.
amy Have you ever been off the grid before?
sheldon Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
leonard I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
howard Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.
bernadette Leave it alone. He means well.
howard So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
bernadette No, not really.
howard And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?
bernadette He’s just trying to be supportive.
howard Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
bernadette No.
raj Hello.
bernadette You saw him carrying that.
howard Astronauts saw him carrying that.
penny This place is great.
leonard So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
penny Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.
sheldon Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?
amy Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.
sheldon Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?
amy On the other hand, safety first.
amy Wow, it’s really coming down.
penny This sucks.
leonard And there goes our hike.
sheldon Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.
penny You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.
leonard Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
penny No.
leonard You’ll wish it would kill you.
amy So what do we do now?
leonard They have some board games.
sheldon Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.
penny Hey, let’s light a fire.
amy Ooh, that sounds cozy.
leonard I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.
sheldon Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.
leonard I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
sheldon That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
leonard Right. So all we need is to…
penny Got it.
leonard A scientist made that.
howard Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.
raj Please, my pleasure.
bernadette And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.
howard But we have to set some boundaries.
raj I don’t understand.
howard The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.
howard Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off.
howard Thanks for understanding.
raj Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
howard You need some help?
raj No, I got it.
bernadette Raj, Raj, wait.
raj Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
penny Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?
sheldon Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.
penny Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
leonard To be fair, good at both.
amy What’s the game?
penny All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.
leonard I’ve never played that before.
sheldon Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?
penny Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…
amy She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.
penny Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.
leonard Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
sheldon So I drink.
amy No, it’s only if you’ve done it.
sheldon Got it.
amy I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
sheldon I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.
penny Sheldon, what did you do?
sheldon Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.
leonard Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.
amy I’m surprised you would do that.
sheldon No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.
penny What, he arrested you for that?
sheldon No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
penny And then you got arrested.
sheldon Oh, and how.
howard I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
bernadette Yeah.
howard But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.
bernadette Yeah.
howard What? Are you gonna cry?
bernadette Yeah.
howard Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
bernadette I can’t tell anymore.
howard I’ll go get him.
bernadette And bring back the bear.
leonard This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
penny How?
leonard Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.
penny Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.
leonard Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
amy Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.
sheldon Amy.
amy You know the rules. Drink.
penny Yeah, go ahead.
leonard That’s right.
sheldon All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
penny I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
leonard I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.
penny We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
leonard What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?
sheldon I’m calling it. I won.
raj I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.
howard No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.
bernadette I hear that.
raj Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?
howard Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.
raj Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
bernadette Of course.
raj Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
howard Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.
leonard Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.
penny How long have you had this secret account?
leonard A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.
penny Well, how much you got in there?
leonard Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
penny My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?
leonard No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.
penny What good is it if you don’t use it?
leonard Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.
penny Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.
leonard Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
penny I hate my job.
leonard Really? Why?
penny Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.
leonard Why didn’t you tell me?
penny Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.
leonard That’s not true.
penny Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
leonard If that’s what you want to do, yes.
penny Well, it’s not what I want to do.
leonard Oh, yes.
penny Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.
leonard Well, that is the grown-up thing.
penny I guess.
leonard I love you.
penny I love you, too.
leonard You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.
penny Well, guess I gotta drink.
howard All right, here we go.
bernadette I’m not hearing anything.
howard Well, give me a second.
raj Are you sure you can do this?
howard Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?
raj I buried it there, so we could go home.
bernadette Wait, that’s it.
raj Wow.
bernadette Isn’t that the best?
raj You guys made a person.
howard We did.
raj And I like to think I helped.
howard You didn’t.
sheldon Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.
amy Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.
amy Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.
amy Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
sheldon Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
amy Well, we all have a past.
