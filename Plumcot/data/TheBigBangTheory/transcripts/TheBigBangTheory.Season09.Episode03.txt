sheldon_cooper Would you pass the mustard?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
sheldon_cooper Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.
raj_koothrappali Hey, there.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour.
howard_wolowitz Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
raj_koothrappali Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?
leonard_hofstadter When do we leave?
howard_wolowitz Right now.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.
howard_wolowitz Wow, okay.
sheldon_cooper You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
raj_koothrappali Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?
sheldon_cooper Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
howard_wolowitz I told you to put tape on his mouth.
raj_koothrappali And I told you he bit me.
sheldon_cooper It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
howard_wolowitz Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting.
sheldon_cooper It runs on syphilis?
raj_koothrappali This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
leonard_hofstadter This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it.
howard_wolowitz I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
leonard_hofstadter So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?
raj_koothrappali Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.
leonard_hofstadter India.
raj_koothrappali We can drive there.
leonard_hofstadter Your house?
howard_wolowitz We are going to Me-hi-co.
leonard_hofstadter Fun, I’ve never been there.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.
raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with Mexico?
sheldon_cooper Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside.
howard_wolowitz Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.
sheldon_cooper Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?
penny Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
penny Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.
penny You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.
amy_farrah_fowler I had extra dough.
penny Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border.
bernadette_rostenkowski I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.
penny Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
amy_farrah_fowler Boy, that was a long night for me.
sheldon_cooper Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.
raj_koothrappali We don’t have any of those.
sheldon_cooper How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.
leonard_hofstadter If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?
sheldon_cooper Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
howard_wolowitz You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
sheldon_cooper You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
amy_farrah_fowler So, Penny, how’s married life?
penny Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.
bernadette_rostenkowski You guys still aren’t living together?
penny We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
bernadette_rostenkowski Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?
amy_farrah_fowler Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.
penny Yes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good for you.
amy_farrah_fowler But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.
penny Yes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good for you.
penny You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.
bernadette_rostenkowski Your sweater?
penny Your glasses?
bernadette_rostenkowski Your hair?
penny Your shoes.
amy_farrah_fowler Piercing my ears.
penny Oh.
bernadette_rostenkowski You really never had that done?
amy_farrah_fowler My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.
penny Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now.
amy_farrah_fowler I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon.
bernadette_rostenkowski We’ll take you to the mall to get it done.
penny Why? I can do it right here.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? You have a piercing gun?
penny No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I don’t know.
penny Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.
bernadette_rostenkowski This party’s weird.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.
howard_wolowitz Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.
raj_koothrappali Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool.
sheldon_cooper It is extraordinary.
raj_koothrappali Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
sheldon_cooper I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.
sheldon_cooper What was that?
howard_wolowitz I think it’s a tyre.
sheldon_cooper What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
howard_wolowitz It’s the tyre.
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I am getting too old for this crud.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did you change yours to married yet?
penny Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally.
amy_farrah_fowler Who?
penny Oh, just my parents and my entire family.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
amy_farrah_fowler Why?
penny Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about your sister’s wedding?
penny They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart.
amy_farrah_fowler How long do you think you can keep it from him?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?
penny Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
raj_koothrappali When did you learn how to change a tyre?
howard_wolowitz Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
sheldon_cooper If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down.
leonard_hofstadter And there’s your damsel.
howard_wolowitz Wow, this one’s really stuck.
raj_koothrappali Are you turning it the right way?
howard_wolowitz No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up.
raj_koothrappali Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way.
penny There you go. You’re all done.
amy_farrah_fowler That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s a joke, right?
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.
penny I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
bernadette_rostenkowski Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.
penny You’re not gonna let this go, are you?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard.
penny Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
penny Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet.
penny You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
penny Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother.
amy_farrah_fowler Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.
penny Hey, Daddy.
wyatt Hey, slugger. How’s my girl?
penny Uh, good. Is Mom around?
wyatt Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she’s gonna make him a little necklace.
penny Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.
wyatt You did? When?
penny Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed.
wyatt Are you happy?
penny Very. Leonard is so great.
wyatt Well, then I’m happy for you.
penny Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.
wyatt Well, I understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em.
penny It is. You’re the best dad ever.
wyatt Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I’ve been sitting on a little news myself.
penny Well, what is it?
wyatt You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?
penny No.
wyatt Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.
penny Moondance?
wyatt Yeah, he’s, uh, not dancing anymore.
penny You killed my pig?
wyatt I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.
penny When?
wyatt Oh, ten, twelve months ago.
penny You didn’t tell me for a year?
wyatt Well, apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, Amy, your turn.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
raj_koothrappali It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
howard_wolowitz Great. He’s pushing with his uterus.
raj_koothrappali There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.
sheldon_cooper Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
raj_koothrappali Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
howard_wolowitz Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s see, a lever, a lever.
sheldon_cooper Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.
leonard_hofstadter We’re gonna be here foreever.
penny Thanks a lot, guys.
bernadette_rostenkowski What did we do?
penny Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? They didn’t eat him?
penny No. He was a beloved member of the family.
bernadette_rostenkowski The breakfast meat family?
penny It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.
penny Phone, now.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.
penny Try dialing.
amy_farrah_fowler You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?
penny Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think the lever’s working.
howard_wolowitz What makes you say that?
leonard_hofstadter There’s gotta be something else we could try.
raj_koothrappali If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.
howard_wolowitz No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
raj_koothrappali If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?
sheldon_cooper Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?
sheldon_cooper Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.
howard_wolowitz We will, we will percussive shock you.
howard_wolowitz@raj_koothrappali We will, we will percussive shock you.
sheldon_cooper Buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it’s a curse.
raj_koothrappali I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
leonard_hofstadter They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.
sheldon_cooper What if that burning food attracts animals?
howard_wolowitz We have plenty of food for the animals.
sheldon_cooper We do?
howard_wolowitz Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
sheldon_cooper That’s not very nice.
leonard_hofstadter It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.
sheldon_cooper What is that awful smell?
howard_wolowitz It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
sheldon_cooper What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.
sheldon_cooper All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.
howard_wolowitz Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
raj_koothrappali Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
leonard_hofstadter Well, let’s start small. We can always add more.
howard_wolowitz You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match.
raj_koothrappali Hey, look, the lug nut’s off.
penny What? What are you doing back?
leonard_hofstadter We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
penny Oh, I’m sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.
sheldon_cooper We blew up Feynman’s van.
penny My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
leonard_hofstadter I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
penny You win.
