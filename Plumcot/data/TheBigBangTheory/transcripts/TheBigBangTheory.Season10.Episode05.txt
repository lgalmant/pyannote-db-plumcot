penny Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?
leonard_hofstadter I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.
sheldon_cooper Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
penny Can’t.
leonard_hofstadter Won’t.
penny Didn’t.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t.
amy_farrah_fowler I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives.
sheldon_cooper I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry for bringing this over here.
penny Believe me, we know what you’re going through.
leonard_hofstadter And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
penny Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.
penny She’s right. That’s reasonable.
sheldon_cooper Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference.
penny Yeah. You tell him, babe.
raj_koothrappali What time do you and Bernadette head out?
howard_wolowitz As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.
raj_koothrappali I’ve never been to Palm Springs.
stuart_bloom Oh, you should go. It’s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.
stuart_bloom It’s nice you and Bernadette are getting away.
howard_wolowitz Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.
stuart_bloom So then what are you doing here buying comic books?
howard_wolowitz Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.
leonard_hofstadter When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.
sheldon_cooper Well I’m open to that.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.
penny Sheldon, what do you say to that?
sheldon_cooper I think we should see other people.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
sheldon_cooper Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.
amy_farrah_fowler We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?
sheldon_cooper Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here.
amy_farrah_fowler You wanna see other people? Go see other people.
penny I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here.
penny All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.
leonard_hofstadter Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.
penny So it’s okay for you to joke around?
leonard_hofstadter No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.
howard_wolowitz Honey, how ya feeling? The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away. So that’s good news, right?
bernadette_rostenkowski The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
howard_wolowitz There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?
bernadette_rostenkowski Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. We don’t have to go.
bernadette_rostenkowski But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.
howard_wolowitz How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home.
bernadette_rostenkowski Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.
howard_wolowitz Does it sound sexy?
bernadette_rostenkowski You just heard me throwing up.
howard_wolowitz You bet I did.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re so weird.
howard_wolowitz You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now.
sheldon_cooper You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.
penny Just as challenging?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny As you?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Just as challenging as you?
sheldon_cooper When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto
penny Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal.
sheldon_cooper She’s always complaining about people at work.
penny Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.
sheldon_cooper Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?
penny You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.
sheldon_cooper I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
penny Agreed. Thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski That feels great.
howard_wolowitz Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?
bernadette_rostenkowski Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
howard_wolowitz It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house.
bernadette_rostenkowski Lock the door, lock the door.
howard_wolowitz We should call the police.
bernadette_rostenkowski Uh, I left my phone downstairs.
howard_wolowitz Damn, so did I.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait, I have my iPad.
howard_wolowitz What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s not helpful.
howard_wolowitz You know I rely on humour in times of stress.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny.
howard_wolowitz Is that the hot tub?
bernadette_rostenkowski Who would use our hot tub?
howard_wolowitz Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who is it?
howard_wolowitz Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?
bernadette_rostenkowski Should we say something to him?
howard_wolowitz Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?
bernadette_rostenkowski I meant like, what are you doing here?
howard_wolowitz Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings.
amy_farrah_fowler Why is nothing easy with him?
leonard_hofstadter Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst.
amy_farrah_fowler I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
leonard_hofstadter I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.
amy_farrah_fowler I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s true.
leonard_hofstadter And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?
amy_farrah_fowler You’re not making me feel better.
leonard_hofstadter Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.
amy_farrah_fowler He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. My record was six.
bernadette_rostenkowski Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?
howard_wolowitz Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?
bernadette_rostenkowski Is someone else here?
raj_koothrappali Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
stuart_bloom What are you doing here?
raj_koothrappali Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
stuart_bloom Did they?
raj_koothrappali Answer the question, what are you doing here?
stuart_bloom I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they’re not home.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
stuart_bloom They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.
bernadette_rostenkowski I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.
penny You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.
sheldon_cooper Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?
penny Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
sheldon_cooper If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.
penny Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream.
sheldon_cooper Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.
penny Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?
sheldon_cooper Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.
penny You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.
raj_koothrappali Here you go.
stuart_bloom Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Shall we toast?
stuart_bloom To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.
bernadette_rostenkowski You said you got it back.
howard_wolowitz Well, clearly, I lied.
raj_koothrappali So how’s your apartment?
stuart_bloom Not great. The electricity’s out.
raj_koothrappali So why don’t you get it fixed?
stuart_bloom I called, and they’re like, pay your bill.
raj_koothrappali If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place.
stuart_bloom Oh, no. I don’t want to be an inconvenience. You’ve got all your lady friends, and…
raj_koothrappali Actually, I’m single now.
stuart_bloom What? When did that happen?
raj_koothrappali It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay.
stuart_bloom Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know.
raj_koothrappali Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?
howard_wolowitz He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, he deserves to be alone.
stuart_bloom So you’re back out on the dating scene now?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, a little.
stuart_bloom Oh, that must be fun. How’s that going?
raj_koothrappali I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
leonard_hofstadter No, don’t do that.
amy_farrah_fowler But you did.
leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?
amy_farrah_fowler Me.
leonard_hofstadter And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
amy_farrah_fowler Me. It was mittens.
leonard_hofstadter And who got him to try a turkey dog?
amy_farrah_fowler That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.
leonard_hofstadter How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.
leonard_hofstadter Of course you do.
amy_farrah_fowler And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.
penny Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.
sheldon_cooper No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.
penny What about the girl behind the counter?
sheldon_cooper Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other.
penny Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
sheldon_cooper You are truly wise.
penny Thank you.
sheldon_cooper I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there.
penny All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
sheldon_cooper Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone.
penny All right.
sheldon_cooper I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.
penny Not relating. Go on.
sheldon_cooper I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
penny Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay.
sheldon_cooper My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.
penny Oh, that’s awful.
sheldon_cooper I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first
penny Well, what happened with your dad?
sheldon_cooper We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.
penny You poor thing.
sheldon_cooper Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to.
penny And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
penny Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.
sheldon_cooper Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.
penny Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?
sheldon_cooper I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
penny Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
raj_koothrappali I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.
stuart_bloom I don’t know. Bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.
howard_wolowitz Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.
bernadette_rostenkowski What do you do in there?
howard_wolowitz It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know.
raj_koothrappali Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home.
stuart_bloom Yeah, you’re probably right.
raj_koothrappali You coming?
stuart_bloom Yeah, just give me a minute.
raj_koothrappali Why?
stuart_bloom Well, you know how you’re wearing a bathing suit?
raj_koothrappali Yeah?
stuart_bloom I kind of went the other way.
howard_wolowitz You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
leonard_hofstadter What do you think?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…
penny We’re back.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hi. Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter How you guys doing?
penny We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
sheldon_cooper I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Really?
leonard_hofstadter Why does she get that? We never got that.
penny Do you want him back?
leonard_hofstadter I’m very happy for you.
sheldon_cooper Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level.
sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?
amy_farrah_fowler I would love to.
leonard_hofstadter Did we really need to be here for this?
penny Call me crazy, but I found it moving.
