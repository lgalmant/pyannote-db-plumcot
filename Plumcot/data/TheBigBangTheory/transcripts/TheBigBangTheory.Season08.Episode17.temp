leonard I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.
penny Again, it was miniature golf.
leonard Admit it, you’re a little turned on.
penny You can’t be this proud.
leonard Why not?
penny Because I beat you.
leonard Hey.
penny Hi.
sheldon Oh, good. You’re back.
amy We have some exciting news.
leonard Okay.
sheldon As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
penny Okay.
amy After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.
leonard Okay.
sheldon Do you want to say it?
amy Let’s say it together.
together We’re getting a turtle.
penny This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
sheldon Sarcasm?
amy Yes.
sheldon Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.
leonard Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.
penny Yes.
amy Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
sheldon No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
leonard Why a turtle?
sheldon After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.
amy For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.
sheldon Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.
leonard Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
penny Mm-hmm.
amy That’s what I said.
raj So, where’s your roommate tonight?
emily Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.
raj But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.
emily And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.
raj That’s okay. I can come back later.
emily No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.
raj Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.
emily Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.
raj Oh, good.
emily Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.
amy It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.
sheldon That was a lot of puppies.
amy Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
sheldon Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
amy Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.
sheldon I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.
amy But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.
sheldon Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
amy What are you talking about?
sheldon Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
amy You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?
sheldon Would you have approved?
amy Of course not.
sheldon Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?
leonard Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.
penny Aw, is this your first time?
leonard No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
penny Well, why?
leonard Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.
penny You went to the dirty store without me?
leonard In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
penny Well, get it. Get it for me.
leonard Yeah?
penny Yeah.
leonard Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.
penny Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?
leonard No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
penny Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.
leonard You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
penny No. No, come on, I want to do it.
leonard Really?
penny Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.
leonard Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.
howard How are the taxes going?
bernadette Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
howard Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
bernadette A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
howard Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. Hey, what’s up?
raj Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?
howard Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
raj What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?
howard She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.
raj So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.
howard What’s wrong?
raj I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
howard So?
raj She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
howard Why were you looking in it?
raj Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
howard Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.
raj Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.
howard You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.
raj Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.
bernadette What’s happening?
howard Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.
bernadette Aw. I’m gonna miss her.
penny So what do you think?
leonard I thought it’d be a little more, just more.
penny I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?
leonard Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
penny Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.
leonard Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?
penny Almost 1am.
leonard Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.
penny Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.
leonard Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.
sheldon I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
amy No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
sheldon I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
amy I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
sheldon Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.
amy Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
sheldon So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
amy I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
sheldon Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.
amy And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.
sheldon First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.
amy You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.
sheldon Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
amy No. Forget it.
sheldon What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
amy Please don’t.
sheldon Yep, you’re mad.
howard Okay, let me see the damage.
raj Hang on.
howard Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.
raj With what?
howard Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
raj She does.
howard Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
raj Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
sheldon I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.
amy Why do you even want to do this?
sheldon Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
amy Can’t you just tell me?
sheldon But I made a video.
sheldon I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
leonard You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
sheldon Yes. Open it and check.
leonard I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
sheldon But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
sheldon Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.
leonard Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.
penny How did you get paint in your eye?
leonard Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
raj This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.
howard It’s fine. You just need two more nails.
raj Okay, where should I put them?
howard In Emily’s eyes.
raj You’re not helping.
bernadette Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.
raj You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…
emily Raj? I’m back.
raj Oh, no. Hey.
emily Hi.
raj How was the hospital?
emily Fine. What were you doing in there?
raj Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
emily You were looking in my night stand?
raj Yeah.
emily So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?
raj You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
emily No.
raj Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.
emily I can’t believe you don’t trust me.
bernadette She sounds really mad.
howard We should hang up.
bernadette Yeah, we should.
howard But we’re not going to, are we?
bernadette Not a chance.
howard What happened to snooping is wrong?
bernadette Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?
leonard Well, we did it.
penny We sure did.
leonard I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.
penny Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.
leonard So, where do we want to hang it?
penny What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.
leonard But it’s an expression of our love.
penny And our butts. Not hanging it.
leonard Seems a shame to throw it away.
penny Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.
leonard God, I love you. I love you so much.
amy I think I’m gonna go home.
sheldon Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
amy You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.
sheldon Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.
amy Sure. Unless something better comes along.
sheldon Do you want me to withdraw my application?
amy What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
sheldon And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.
amy We’re on the same planet.
sheldon Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
amy Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
sheldon I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?
amy Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
sheldon Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?
amy You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.
sheldon You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?
amy Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.
sheldon They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
amy I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.
sheldon Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.
raj Thank you for forgiving me.
emily That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.
raj Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.
emily Can I ask you one thing?
raj Of course. What?
emily Did you look in my closet?
raj No. Just the drawer.
emily You promise you didn’t look in the closet?
raj I promise. Why, what’s in there?
emily Don’t worry about it. Good night.
