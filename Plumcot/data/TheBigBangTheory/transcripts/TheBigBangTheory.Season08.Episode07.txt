bernadette_rostenkowski So, what are you working on these days?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
bernadette_rostenkowski What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
penny Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.
bernadette_rostenkowski Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.
penny Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.
bernadette_rostenkowski He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?
amy_farrah_fowler I think it’s awful.
penny Why would you say that?
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?
penny I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
amy_farrah_fowler I just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
penny Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.
bernadette_rostenkowski I was kind of excited about the article, but now you’re making me feel bad.
penny No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.
man_with_flowers#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Thank you.
sheldon_cooper No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your hand, but, well, you know.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 I’m not a delivery man, I’m a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.
sheldon_cooper That’s humorous.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 All right.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 All right.
sheldon_cooper Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.
sheldon_cooper Making the extra effort. Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Great timing, food just got here.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, Siam Palace?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Uh, extra peanut sauce?
leonard_hofstadter No, but you can have mine.
sheldon_cooper Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancée as we speak.
leonard_hofstadter What? Why didn’t you say that first?
sheldon_cooper Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
leonard_hofstadter Can I help you?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?
leonard_hofstadter May I ask why?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at you.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two…
leonard_hofstadter I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Really? I’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.
raj_koothrappali Really?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?
leonard_hofstadter I think so.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 When will I learn? It’s just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You’re a, you’re a lucky man.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Sorry.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Oh, uh, you probably don’t want her to see this. It’s unnecessarily graphic.
sheldon_cooper Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.
leonard_hofstadter He tried to score with Penny.
sheldon_cooper So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.
amy_farrah_fowler So, how was work today?
bernadette_rostenkowski It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.
amy_farrah_fowler What happened?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they’re rethinking it.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up here.
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.
bernadette_rostenkowski What? How?
amy_farrah_fowler I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, what did you say?
amy_farrah_fowler I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.
bernadette_rostenkowski Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.
amy_farrah_fowler But it was bad publicity.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s for me to decide, not you.
amy_farrah_fowler I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.
bernadette_rostenkowski And I think you don’t like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I’m so sorry. That was over the line.
amy_farrah_fowler You have a nice night.
bernadette_rostenkowski Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.
sheldon_cooper Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.
raj_koothrappali Oh, cool.
howard_wolowitz How’d you get that?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.
sheldon_cooper Wait a minute. You’ve snipped Gene Roddenberry’s vas deferens?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Yes.
howard_wolowitz Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 I don’t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I’m kind of the doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts.
all@ Wow.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron’s kidney stone?
all@ Ooh.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.
leonard_hofstadter That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn’t really get serious until William Shatner’s bladder infection.
sheldon_cooper What’d you get? What’d you get?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it’s pretty cool.
raj_koothrappali I would love to see your collection.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Anytime. Uh, I’ve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.
howard_wolowitz We know.
raj_koothrappali Preach.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Can I ask you a personal question?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Um, I mean, you’re a guy like me, so how’d you get a girl like Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.
sheldon_cooper Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.
howard_wolowitz A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called a urethra.
leonard_hofstadter Can we please change the subject?
penny Hi.
raj_koothrappali Well, that didn’t go your way.
penny Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?
dr_oliver_lorvis Uh, well, actually I came to see you.
penny Really? Why?
leonard_hofstadter Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.
sheldon_cooper Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.
penny Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.
dr_oliver_lorvis You touched my arm for two Mississippis.
penny Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.
leonard_hofstadter Can we talk in private?
penny Please, yes.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll be right back.
sheldon_cooper So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
leonard_hofstadter So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?
penny What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
penny Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.
penny You were okay with that?
leonard_hofstadter No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.
penny Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think that’s a little weird?
leonard_hofstadter A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually kind of a nice guy.
penny Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.
leonard_hofstadter Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
penny I can’t do it, he’s my best client.
leonard_hofstadter All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.
raj_koothrappali Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection. You want to go with us?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure. You owe me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.
dr_oliver_lorvis Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on. It’s a replica.
dr_oliver_lorvis Original.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.
raj_koothrappali The gun from Hellboy?
dr_oliver_lorvis Yup.
raj_koothrappali How did you get it?
dr_oliver_lorvis Bought it at auction.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s testicles.
womans_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode07 Oliver, I’m going to play bingo.
dr_oliver_lorvis Okay, Mother. Have fun.
howard_wolowitz Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond.
leonard_hofstadter Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
sheldon_cooper Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?
leonard_hofstadter No, because I liked it.
sheldon_cooper Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.
dr_oliver_lorvis So, I’ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.
sheldon_cooper Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.
dr_oliver_lorvis So, you think she’ll be single soon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too late. All the squares have been purchased.
dr_oliver_lorvis Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.
dr_oliver_lorvis Oh, could you hold the door?
amy_farrah_fowler Nice flowers.
dr_oliver_lorvis Thank you. They’re for a girl. Uh, I’m being implacable and relentless.
amy_farrah_fowler Isn’t she lucky?
dr_oliver_lorvis She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s that?
dr_oliver_lorvis Unconditional love.
amy_farrah_fowler I guess that’s all anybody wants.
dr_oliver_lorvis I guess so.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I hope you get it.
dr_oliver_lorvis One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
leonard_hofstadter Next game, let’s switch helmets.
sheldon_cooper No, I’d look silly in that helmet.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t take these.
dr_oliver_lorvis Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.
amy_farrah_fowler But what about the other girl?
dr_oliver_lorvis Oh, right. I’ll tell her we should just be friends.
penny Dr. Lorvis?
dr_oliver_lorvis Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?
raj_koothrappali You think he bites?
howard_wolowitz Stick your head in there and find out.
raj_koothrappali You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
leonard_hofstadter I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.
raj_koothrappali Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.
howard_wolowitz It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.
raj_koothrappali Okay, now you’re messing with me.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, guys, we’re locked in here.
sheldon_cooper Oh, this day just keeps getting better.
penny So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?
dr_oliver_lorvis Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.
amy_farrah_fowler We all have a past.
penny Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little creepy.
dr_oliver_lorvis You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.
penny Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s nice to you.
dr_oliver_lorvis Well, that’s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.
penny Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?
dr_oliver_lorvis Well, they’re, they’re not locked in. The door just sticks.
penny Okay, so how do they unstick it?
dr_oliver_lorvis They’d need the key.
penny Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.
dr_oliver_lorvis Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.
penny Move it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
dr_oliver_lorvis She seems nice. Who’s she?
penny Just walk.
sheldon_cooper You can do this.
raj_koothrappali One ladder left.
leonard_hofstadter Oh-hom yeah.
howard_wolowitz Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Next level.
penny Leonard, are you okay?
leonard_hofstadter Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
amy_farrah_fowler Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?
dr_oliver_lorvis Yes. I’m very sorry for locking you in my home.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.
leonard_hofstadter Got it.
penny Okay, Leonard, let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter Just hang on.
dr_oliver_lorvis Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire’s prostate sonogram?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
penny Yeah.
dr_oliver_lorvis Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.
