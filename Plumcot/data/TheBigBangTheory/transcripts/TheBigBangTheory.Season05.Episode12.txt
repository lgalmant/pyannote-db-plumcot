howard_wolowitz Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
howard_wolowitz Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?
raj_koothrappali Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party.
howard_wolowitz As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila.
raj_koothrappali I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
sheldon_cooper This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
howard_wolowitz How is this lying?
sheldon_cooper A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
raj_koothrappali Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
sheldon_cooper If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
howard_wolowitz Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
sheldon_cooper Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.
howard_wolowitz How is that not amusing?
sheldon_cooper It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.
howard_wolowitz Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.
leonard_hofstadter Next time, you should open with that.
penny Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy.
sheldon_cooper And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
penny So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.
penny That is so hot.
sheldon_cooper All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?
amy_farrah_fowler How was your day?
sheldon_cooper Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.
amy_farrah_fowler Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
sheldon_cooper Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.
sheldon_cooper Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here.
penny So, are we ready to order?
amy_farrah_fowler Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination.
penny Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
sheldon_cooper Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
penny Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things.
penny Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by.
sheldon_cooper What if they simply don’t excite me?
penny Well, just smile and think about koalas.
sheldon_cooper She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
bernadette_rostenkowski Did it work?
howard_wolowitz Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?
howard_wolowitz Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.
debbie_wolowitz Has she tried on the vest yet?
howard_wolowitz I just gave it to her!
debbie_wolowitz I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She’s short and stacked, like me!
howard_wolowitz She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!
bernadette_rostenkowski Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant.
howard_wolowitz You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids.
howard_wolowitz Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?
bernadette_rostenkowski Mmm, yeah, sure.
howard_wolowitz Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.
sheldon_cooper Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.
leonard_hofstadter Some people go outside and do that.
sheldon_cooper It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
leonard_hofstadter You want to talk about it?
sheldon_cooper No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
leonard_hofstadter You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.
leonard_hofstadter Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
sheldon_cooper Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
leonard_hofstadter No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women.
sheldon_cooper I’ll say.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.
leonard_hofstadter Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
sheldon_cooper Nuts to that. What else you got?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.
sheldon_cooper How does that work?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
sheldon_cooper Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.
leonard_hofstadter Glad I could help.
sheldon_cooper It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour.
howard_wolowitz And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, ah, right. And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion.
child#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 When are we gonna have cake?
bernadette_rostenkowski After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
child#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 But we want cake now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?
howard_wolowitz Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.
second_child#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 I know how you do that trick.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you know how to pipe down?
howard_wolowitz Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper.
second_child#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 It’s a fake pitcher.
bernadette_rostenkowski You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
howard_wolowitz Okay, we’re going to stick this in here and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants.
second_child#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 Look, I Googled it. It’s a fake pitcher.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
howard_wolowitz She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not him.
howard_wolowitz Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
bernadette_rostenkowski I told you I’m not good with kids.
howard_wolowitz Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.
bernadette_rostenkowski The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so?
bernadette_rostenkowski Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!
howard_wolowitz All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?
bernadette_rostenkowski Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different.
howard_wolowitz Well, yeah.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
penny Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, a pocket watch.
penny Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch.
sheldon_cooper No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
penny Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?
sheldon_cooper Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?
penny Trust me, we are not a couple.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
penny Fine, go ahead.
sheldon_cooper Trust me, we are not a couple.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 My apologies. How can I help you today?
penny He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 Great, trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through USC.
penny Ooh, are these real diamonds?
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.
sheldon_cooper Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 Actually, that’s only 750. Everything’s on sale.
sheldon_cooper Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
howard_wolowitz I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday.
raj_koothrappali Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
leonard_hofstadter There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved.
raj_koothrappali Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.
leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna do?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
leonard_hofstadter You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.
raj_koothrappali Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?
leonard_hofstadter It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
howard_wolowitz Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other.
leonard_hofstadter Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
howard_wolowitz I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.
raj_koothrappali What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
howard_wolowitz Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden.
sheldon_cooper What time did you tell Amy to be here?
penny Eight o’clock. Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
penny I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?
sheldon_cooper Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey.
penny Hi.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s he doing here?
penny Okay, he wants to talk to you.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last.
penny Sheldon, you’re up.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.
amy_farrah_fowler We both know that’s your koala face.
sheldon_cooper I told you.
penny Okay, look, he bought you this.
amy_farrah_fowler Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
penny You look beautiful.
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!
sheldon_cooper You’re right, the tiara was too much.
debbie_wolowitz Howard! Bernadette’s… Oh, she slipped right by me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here’s your vest back.
howard_wolowitz You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know, hunting?
debbie_wolowitz Don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don’t get grandkids!
howard_wolowitz Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess you talked to your mom, huh?
howard_wolowitz I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.
howard_wolowitz Really? That’s great. What?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?
howard_wolowitz Me?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yay, so we’re good.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, we’re good.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?
howard_wolowitz I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom.
