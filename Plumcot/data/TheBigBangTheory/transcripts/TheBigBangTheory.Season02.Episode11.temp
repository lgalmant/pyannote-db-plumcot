sheldon Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.
howard What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
sheldon Like what?
howard I don’t know. Kryptonian mustard.
sheldon I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
raj Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.
leonard Raj, please, let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
howard Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
sheldon Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.
howard Okay, he’s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?” Superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.
raj Booya.
sheldon Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
raj “Kandorian dry cl…” I give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man.
howard Hey, isn’t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.
raj Then how?
howard Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.
raj I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?
howard No.
leonard It’s David Underhill. So what?
sheldon So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
leonard I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop.
sheldon It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
leonard Did not.
howard Did, too.
leonard Did…okay,maybe some of it,but,look,the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.
raj In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.
howard Doesn’t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I’m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.
raj Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.
david Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?
leonard Uh, yeah.
david I’m David Underhill.
leonard Uh, y-yeah.
david Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you’d be able to give me a hand?
leonard You want to work with me?
david Well, if you have a little time, yeah.
leonard Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…
david Okay.
leonard Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.
david Thanks. I’ll call you.
leonard Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
raj Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.
leonard Hey, guys!
howard That doesn’t count. Do over! Do over!
sheldon There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
howard There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
sheldon Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?
leonard Actually, I was…
sheldon It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
leonard Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it.
sheldon Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
howard Where were you?
leonard I was working with Dave Underhill.
howard Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard’s got a new BFF.
leonard Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
howard So? We’re in a rock band.
leonard No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
sheldon Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
leonard He’s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I’m gonna go practice my situps.
raj Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.
howard Yep. It’s officially a bro-mance.
penny Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?
sheldon No, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.
penny Saturnalia?
howard Gather round, kids, it’s time for Sheldon’s beloved Christmas special.
sheldon In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.
howard And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.
penny Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I’ll just put them under my tree.
sheldon Wait! You bought me a present?
penny Uh-huh.
sheldon Why would you do such a thing?
penny I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s Christmas?
sheldon Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation.
howard Don’t feel bad, Penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.
penny Now, honey, it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return.
sheldon Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
penny Okay, you know what? Forget it. I’m not giving you a present.
sheldon No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.
howard I know. It’s funny when it’s not happening to us.
penny Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
sheldon No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall.
howard It’s happening to us.
leonard Ow! Ow!
david Are you gonna make it?
leonard Yeah, I guess.
david All right.
leonard Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
david No problem.
leonard I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?
david Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn’t moving.
penny Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?
leonard Oh, yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident.
penny My God, how fast were you going?
leonard I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.
david Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn’t even get it started. Hi. Dave.
penny Hi. Penny. So it’s your motorcycle?
david Uh-huh.
penny Oh, is it okay?
david It’s fine.
leonard Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.
david You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?
penny Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?
david I’m a physicist.
penny Ha-ha. No, you’re not.
david Why is that so surprising?
penny Uh, well, it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
leonard I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.
penny So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?
david Yeah, actually we are.
leonard Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.
penny Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.
leonard Since when?
penny Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.
david The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.
penny Ha. Well, that’s what I am, queen of the nerds.
david Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we’re working in. We’ve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.
penny You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.
leonard Since when?
penny Since always.
david Leonard, are you okay here?
leonard Uh, yeah. I guess.
david How ’bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat…
penny Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.
david Boy, she’ll do, huh?
leonard Yeah, if you like that type.
david So, you and her?
leonard No, just neighbours.
david Really. I don’t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.
leonard Actually, science is my lady.
penny Okay. Let’s go.
david All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.
leonard See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun.
sheldon Yes? Did you forget your key?
sheldon I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
howard You’re kidding. You’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick.
leonard What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
raj Sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear.
sheldon I told you before, bears are terrifying.
howard Come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
sheldon That presupposes Penny is tense.
raj She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
howard Excuse me, we’re ready.
sheldon No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?
howard This one. Let’s go.
sheldon You put no thought into that.
howard I’m sorry. Uh, this one. Let’s go!
sheldon I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?
assistant Yes?
sheldon If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.
assistant Excuse me?
sheldon Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?
assistant I don’t understand what you’re talking about and you’re making me a little uncomfortable.
howard See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We’ll take it.
david Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.
leonard Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.
penny Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!
leonard Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
penny I never said that.
leonard Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
david This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.
penny Oh, shut up!
leonard Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself.
david Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.
penny Really? We’re going to do an experiment?
david Uh-huh. We’re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.
penny It’s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
david You ready to go?
penny Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
david Yeah, why not? You can’t do any worse than Leonard.
leonard That’s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
sheldon Mmm, great news, Leonard, I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma.
leonard Yippee.
sheldon You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.
leonard Brilliant.
sheldon It is, isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.
leonard Do whatever you want.
sheldon Thank you, that’s very gracious. Gentlemen.
howard Why couldn’t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
leonard My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
leonard Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?
penny Why are you yelling at me?
leonard Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool.
penny Dave is not smarter than you. He’s an idiot.
leonard Really? Why would you say that?
penny Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
leonard He tried to take nude photos of you?
penny That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!
leonard Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible.
penny And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?
leonard Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!
penny Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
leonard Lactose.
penny It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
leonard Smooth.
penny Smoother than you.
leonard Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one.
penny Okay, Merry Christmas.
leonard By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
penny Merry Christmas.
leonard Merry Christmas.
penny How’s your leg?
leonard Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.
sheldon Ah, good, Penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer.
penny Okay, here.
sheldon I should note I’m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.
penny Turn it over.
sheldon To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.
penny Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin’s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
sheldon I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
penny Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
sheldon Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
penny Okay, all I’m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
sheldon Be right back.
penny Here. Open it.
leonard Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
penny Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.
leonard Oh, then, I think you’ll appreciate what I got you.
penny Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
leonard You know, ’cause you’re so into science.
penny Sheldon! What did you do?!
sheldon I know! It’s not enough, is it? Here.
penny Leonard, look! Sheldon’s hugging me.
leonard It’s a Saturnalia miracle.
