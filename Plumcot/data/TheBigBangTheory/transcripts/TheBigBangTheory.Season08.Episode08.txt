leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld.
leonard_hofstadter I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.
howard_wolowitz That’s fine. I don’t care.
raj_koothrappali It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?
howard_wolowitz They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.
raj_koothrappali And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
howard_wolowitz Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating.
raj_koothrappali Like who?
howard_wolowitz Like you and your dog.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t rule out the dating.
howard_wolowitz Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
sheldon_cooper You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
howard_wolowitz How is this helpful?
sheldon_cooper All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
leonard_hofstadter But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
sheldon_cooper True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
penny Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski We brought snacks for movie night.
penny Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
bernadette_rostenkowski Right here.
penny Ah, You guys are the best.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s with the clothes?
penny Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.
amy_farrah_fowler I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?
penny That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.
penny What kind of teenager did you think I was?
bernadette_rostenkowski Slutty.
amy_farrah_fowler Easy.
penny The word is popular.
bernadette_rostenkowski How was your prom? Did you go?
amy_farrah_fowler No, but I was on clean-up crew.
penny Aw, that’s sad.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.
bernadette_rostenkowski My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.
penny Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.
bernadette_rostenkowski Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
penny No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
amy_farrah_fowler My date would’ve had to clean that up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.
penny Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.
amy_farrah_fowler You went to seven proms?
penny Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, where’s Bernadette?
howard_wolowitz She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.
howard_wolowitz Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.
raj_koothrappali Did you go to your prom?
sheldon_cooper No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
penny Okay, okay.
sheldon_cooper …of AP Calculus.
raj_koothrappali How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
leonard_hofstadter Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?
penny Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.
penny Ugh, thanks a lot.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch.
raj_koothrappali That sounds like a yes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?
howard_wolowitz Yep.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.
howard_wolowitz You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.
howard_wolowitz I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone.
bernadette_rostenkowski I saw a picture of you two dancing together.
howard_wolowitz What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.
stuart_bloom Hello.
howard_wolowitz Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?
stuart_bloom I’m not bringing your mother, I have a date.
howard_wolowitz Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?
stuart_bloom Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.
debbie_wolowitz Stewie, your bath is getting cold!
stuart_bloom I got to go, bye.
sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny You knocked more than usual.
sheldon_cooper Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank.
penny Okay, what’s up?
sheldon_cooper I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.
penny Great, how?
sheldon_cooper We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
penny Okay, just one question. What?
sheldon_cooper My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.
penny Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
sheldon_cooper There are post-prom mating rituals?
penny Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.
sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it.
penny You’re kidding.
sheldon_cooper I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on.
leonard_hofstadter You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.
sheldon_cooper Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
leonard_hofstadter Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
sheldon_cooper His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.
leonard_hofstadter There, perfect.
sheldon_cooper What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
sheldon_cooper I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.
leonard_hofstadter Was that a flask?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.
leonard_hofstadter You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.
leonard_hofstadter If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?
sheldon_cooper Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.
leonard_hofstadter And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to.
sheldon_cooper Why would you say that?
leonard_hofstadter You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
sheldon_cooper Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
leonard_hofstadter Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.
leonard_hofstadter Wow, you look amazing.
penny Thank you, so do you.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you look so handsome.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s that?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me.
amy_farrah_fowler Where are you going?
sheldon_cooper I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.
leonard_hofstadter He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s a neat tattoo.
emily_sweeney Oh, thanks, it’s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that movie’s so cute.
howard_wolowitz Do you like her because you both have red hair?
emily_sweeney Uh, a little, but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.
bernadette_rostenkowski I like Cinderella.
emily_sweeney Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?
bernadette_rostenkowski I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
raj_koothrappali Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.
emily_sweeney Oh, she’s cute.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz That’s Jeanie.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s Jeanie?
emily_sweeney Who’s Jeanie?
howard_wolowitz Don’t say it.
raj_koothrappali That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
howard_wolowitz She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it.
emily_sweeney No, it’s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.
howard_wolowitz Raj.
raj_koothrappali It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?
penny Oh, it’s beautiful.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, the girls really did a nice job.
penny Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.
leonard_hofstadter What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.
penny Well, who’d you go with?
leonard_hofstadter I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
penny Aw.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…
penny Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.
leonard_hofstadter No, you wouldn’t have.
penny Well, you don’t know that.
leonard_hofstadter It was before my growth spurt.
penny What, that already happened?
leonard_hofstadter Very funny.
penny Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.
leonard_hofstadter I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, can I come in?
sheldon_cooper I don’t think that’s a good idea.
amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
sheldon_cooper According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re making me worry. What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
amy_farrah_fowler What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
sheldon_cooper It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
scene The limo.
stuart_bloom So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys’. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.
raj_koothrappali Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
howard_wolowitz So, my mother’s okay with this?
jeanie Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?
howard_wolowitz ‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.
jeanie Weirder than what you and I did in my dad’s Corolla?
raj_koothrappali This is so messed up.
emily_sweeney I know, I’m having the best time.
howard_wolowitz Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?
jeanie It was a long time ago, Howard.
stuart_bloom And you’re only second cousins, who cares?
bernadette_rostenkowski So, you knew and you brought her anyway?
stuart_bloom Oh, so she’s good enough for Howard, but not for me?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
penny Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.
leonard_hofstadter There’s no music.
penny I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.
leonard_hofstadter My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.
penny Thank you for wearing your heels.
leonard_hofstadter Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
penny Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
leonard_hofstadter I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
penny I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, get off of him.
howard_wolowitz Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye.
sheldon_cooper I really did think you looked pretty.
amy_farrah_fowler You did?
sheldon_cooper Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together.
sheldon_cooper Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for understanding.
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
sheldon_cooper I love you, too.
amy_farrah_fowler You said it.
sheldon_cooper There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
sheldon_cooper Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…
stuart_bloom Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I’m here with Jeanie. Okay, but we’re just friends. It’s, yeah. I got to go.
