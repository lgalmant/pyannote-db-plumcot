leonard It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
sheldon I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?
leonard What did you have in mind?
sheldon Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.
leonard It would be a replica of a movie prop.
sheldon Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
leonard Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
sheldon Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
leonard Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
sheldon Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it.
stuart Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.
leonard Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.
sheldon Okay? It’s magnificent.
leonard Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
stuart Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?
leonard Oh, that’s pretty steep.
stuart Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
sheldon Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.
leonard Hang on. Can you do any better?
stuart Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount.
sheldon Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.
leonard Slow down. Two hundred.
sheldon What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
leonard Will you shut up?
stuart Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five.
leonard Nope. Maybe another time.
stuart Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.
sheldon Take it, take it.
leonard Two hundred.
stuart Man, you’re killing me!
sheldon Killing you? I can’t breathe.
stuart Two ten, and I’m losing money.
sheldon Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry.
leonard Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
stuart Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr.
leonard So?
stuart Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!
leonard Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.
stuart Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
leonard See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
sheldon I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.
stuart You want me to wrap it?
leonard No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.
wil_wheaton Hey, Stuart.
stuart Ah, hey, Wil.
sheldon Hello, Wil Wheaton.
wil Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
sheldon It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
wil No.
sheldon I’m not surprised.
stuart Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
wil Awesome. What do I owe you?
stuart Forty bucks.
wil Good deal.
sheldon Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
wil Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.
stuart Will there be girls there?
wil Yeah, of course.
stuart ‘Cause there wasn’t last time.
wil There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.
leonard Thank you.
wil All right, great. Later.
sheldon I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.
leonard I was actually thinking about going.
sheldon And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.
leonard No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.
stuart Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.
leonard Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
sheldon Possibly.
leonard Can you or can’t you?
sheldon It’s not that simple, Leonard.
leonard It never is, is it?
sheldon At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.
leonard Got it. Can I have my water?
sheldon Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
penny Wait, what is going on?
sheldon In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…
penny No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
amy Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?
howard Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.
all Wow.
bernadette Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!
howard It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.
sheldon Mohammed Lee.
howard Who’s Mohammed Lee?
sheldon Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
howard It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut.
all Wow, that’s amazing!
bernadette Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
howard Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.
bernadette Are those Russian rockets safe?
howard Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.
leonard I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you.
all Cheers.
sheldon That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.
howard You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?
bernadette Fine. Just a little tired.
howard I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.
bernadette I always catch your drift.
howard All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?
bernadette I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
howard Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.
bernadette Just stop talking, Howard.
howard This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
bernadette What did you think was going to happen?
howard Honestly? Sex.
bernadette Howard.
howard Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
bernadette Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team.
howard I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it.
bernadette Okay.
howard I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
bernadette Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.
howard Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?
bernadette No.
howard No?
bernadette No.
howard Well why not?
bernadette Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you.
howard Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.
bernadette Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!
leonard Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
sheldon Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.
leonard For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
sheldon Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?
leonard You never stop talking, do you?
amy I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?
penny Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
amy Mortal enemy?
penny Mm-hmm.
amy Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?
sheldon In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?
penny Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
sheldon You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
amy A floppy disk?
sheldon Well, I started the list when I was nine.
amy How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
all Oh! Oh, God!
sheldon As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.
bernadette Howard?
howard Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it.
bernadette No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.
howard Really?
bernadette Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.
howard Thank you.
bernadette I love you.
howard I love you, too. So, sex now?
bernadette Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back.
mrs_wolowitz Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!
bernadette I’m ready.
leonard Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?
howard What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
raj Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
howard Little bit.
leonard I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
sheldon Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.
leonard Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
sheldon Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.
leonard I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
sheldon Not yet.
raj So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?
howard I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions.
raj Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
howard Obviously.
bernadette I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
amy You’re kidding.
penny No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.
bernadette I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.
penny Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?
bernadette Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
amy It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
bernadette Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
penny Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.
bernadette What?
penny Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
bernadette I do, with all my heart.
penny Got it. Just had to check.
amy He’s great.
leonard All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.
sheldon No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.
leonard You want to drive?
raj Sure.
leonard Hey, Sheldon?
sheldon Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.
leonard No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
sheldon Brent Spiner?
leonard Yes.
sheldon I don’t care.
leonard Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.
sheldon I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.
leonard I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.
sheldon Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, Bernadette’s here!
howard Tell her I’m not home!
mrs_wolowitz What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!
bernadette Can we talk?
howard You can. I have nothing to say.
bernadette All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.
howard I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.
bernadette I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.
howard If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.
bernadette I know.
howard Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.
bernadette Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
howard Well, those big kids were rocking it.
bernadette I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.
howard Really?
bernadette You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
howard Right, right.
mrs_wolowitz Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!
raj Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?
leonard Yeah.
raj Well, I just met her gynaecologist!
leonard What are you doing here?
sheldon Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home.
wil Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.
sheldon What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
wil This is for you.
sheldon An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
wil I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t show up.
wil Look at what I wrote.
sheldon To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.
wil It’s my last one. I want you to have it.
sheldon Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!
brent_spiner Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years. Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
sheldon Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.
brent Sorry, Slim. I’ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?
sheldon You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.
wil Don’t worry. It doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time.
sheldon Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.
leonard Can we get autographed dolls?
brent Sure. Twenty bucks.
leonard Ten.
brent Eighteen.
leonard Twelve.
brent Sixteen.
leonard Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
brent Done.
