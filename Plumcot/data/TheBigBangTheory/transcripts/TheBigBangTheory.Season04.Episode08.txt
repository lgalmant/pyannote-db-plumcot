penny Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?
howard_wolowitz Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s how I learned.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
penny And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat, Pray, Love.
leonard_hofstadter When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it.
howard_wolowitz I don’t care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I’m not reading it.
penny You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.
sheldon_cooper That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really scary.
leonard_hofstadter Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
sheldon_cooper There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.
howard_wolowitz Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.
penny Well, I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?
sheldon_cooper Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
penny What, 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!
leonard_hofstadter Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
sheldon_cooper Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm. Oh, good. I’m eight for 26 this month.
penny Yeah, I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.
leonard_hofstadter Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together.
penny Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t.
howard_wolowitz Uh-huh. I’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.
sheldon_cooper May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?
leonard_hofstadter Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight.
sheldon_cooper Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go.
howard_wolowitz You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.
sheldon_cooper See? Howard’s on my side.
howard_wolowitz Actually, I’m not. I’m using sarcasm to mock you.
sheldon_cooper Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine.
sheldon_cooper But how were our seats?
leonard_hofstadter Excellent.
sheldon_cooper I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.
sheldon_cooper Shrewd.
amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, you’re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler See? It’s working.
bernadette_rostenkowski Knock-knock.
howard_wolowitz Who’s there?
bernadette_rostenkowski Olive.
howard_wolowitz Olive you, too.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, that’s really starting to get old.
howard_wolowitz Knock-knock.
leonard_hofstadter Who’s there?
howard_wolowitz I have a girlfriend and you don’t.
leonard_hofstadter Hysterical!
sheldon_cooper Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?
howard_wolowitz So. Are you sure you don’t want to come with us to Raiders?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls’ night tonight.
amy_farrah_fowler Girls’ night? What does that entail?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m a girl.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I’ll ask Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler No need. Penny and I are very close.
bernadette_rostenkowski You are?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night.
penny Yeah?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m a girl.
penny Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, but they’re not girls. I’m a girl.
penny Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s the dress code?
penny Uh, just wear something comfortable.
amy_farrah_fowler All right. I’ll have to go shopping.
sheldon_cooper Knock-knock.
leonard_hofstadter Who‘s there?
sheldon_cooper Hugh.
leonard_hofstadter Hugh who?
sheldon_cooper Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
sheldon_cooper Under normal circumstances I’d say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.
howard_wolowitz Ooh. Can’t wait for that to start.
sheldon_cooper I informed you thusly.
raj_koothrappali Eight for 28.
sheldon_cooper This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
raj_koothrappali Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.
sheldon_cooper And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.
leonard_hofstadter So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
raj_koothrappali You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–
howard_wolowitz Oh, shut up.
amy_farrah_fowler So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.
penny You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts.
amy_farrah_fowler Shame. ‘Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
bernadette_rostenkowski Penny, your nails look great.
penny Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a woman’s basement. I think it’s a front
amy_farrah_fowler A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.
penny So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
bernadette_rostenkowski Or we could just stay here.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don’t.
penny All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.
bernadette_rostenkowski Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.
penny That’s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, good, a slumber party! We’ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!
penny Oh, gosh, Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an actual slumber party.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s disappointing. I’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you never were?
penny Not even when you were a kid?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn’t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.
penny Okay. Well, I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!
amy_farrah_fowler Pillow fight!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle.
howard_wolowitz Too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.
leonard_hofstadter What’s a stadium pal?
howard_wolowitz Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre the length of this line, we might not get seats.
sheldon_cooper What did he say?
leonard_hofstadter Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.
sheldon_cooper We might not get seats?
leonard_hofstadter It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t you?
wil_wheaton Hey, look who’s here! Hey, buddies!
sheldon_cooper Well, if it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.
wil_wheaton Mee-sa think that very funny.
sheldon_cooper Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 Wil Wheaton.
wil_wheaton Yeah.
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 I’m a big fan.
sheldon_cooper Of what? Poorly executed beards?
wil_wheaton Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 No problem. Come on, I’ll hook you up.
wil_wheaton Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.
sheldon_cooper This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.
leonard_hofstadter Calm down, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!
leonard_hofstadter Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?
bernadette_rostenkowski You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.
penny Howard has a hairy chest?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, just the one. But it’s really long.
penny Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?
amy_farrah_fowler My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.
raj_koothrappali Oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people in.
sheldon_cooper Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.
leonard_hofstadter Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.
sheldon_cooper I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me. Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?
penny And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.
penny Okay, it’s your game. You go first.
amy_farrah_fowler Hang on. I’m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?
bernadette_rostenkowski Truth.
amy_farrah_fowler All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
bernadette_rostenkowski Um.
amy_farrah_fowler Remember, you have to answer honestly.
penny Wait. No, Amy, you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?
sheldon_cooper Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot.
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.
sheldon_cooper No!
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 We’re full up.
leonard_hofstadter We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 Sorry. Fire regulations. Should’ve gotten here earlier.
sheldon_cooper This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
theatre_staff#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode08 ‘Cause I’m the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch.
howard_wolowitz I guess that’s that. Let’s go home.
sheldon_cooper You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told you so.
raj_koothrappali We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.
sheldon_cooper Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.
howard_wolowitz I guess we’d better go after him.
leonard_hofstadter Short Round?
raj_koothrappali Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?
raj_koothrappali You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
amy_farrah_fowler And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.”
penny What the hell was that?
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller’s Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
bernadette_rostenkowski I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
amy_farrah_fowler You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?
penny Truth.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that’s an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
penny Dare.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
penny Okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean, Leonard’s a great guy.
amy_farrah_fowler Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?
penny I don’t know. He got really serious, and I wasn’t ready for it.
amy_farrah_fowler Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?
penny You can only ask one question.
amy_farrah_fowler@bernadette_rostenkowski That one.
penny You know what, I don’t want to play anymore.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Sheldon?
howard_wolowitz Where did he go? We’re looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.
sheldon_cooper You whistled?
leonard_hofstadter What is that?
sheldon_cooper Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it, no one else can see it.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is crazy.
sheldon_cooper No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
leonard_hofstadter Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
sheldon_cooper Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it’s Lee, but I prefer Trouble.
wil_wheaton Oh, look who they let in.
sheldon_cooper Don’t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving. Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!
howard_wolowitz Come on, Short Round.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!
raj_koothrappali Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!
howard_wolowitz Let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
wil_wheaton He’s got the movie! Get him!
sheldon_cooper Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s been in there a long time.
amy_farrah_fowler Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, like what?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?
amy_farrah_fowler Penny?
penny Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I’m sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry. I’ll avoid the nether yea.
bernadette_rostenkowski I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
