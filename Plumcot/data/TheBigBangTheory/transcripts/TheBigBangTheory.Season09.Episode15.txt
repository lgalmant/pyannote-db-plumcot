sheldon_cooper Gentlemen.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hello.
sheldon_cooper If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.
leonard_hofstadter Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.
howard_wolowitz Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.
sheldon_cooper Not a clue. Raj?
raj_koothrappali Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t sound very excited about it.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
howard_wolowitz Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
raj_koothrappali You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?
howard_wolowitz You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, just get it over with.
raj_koothrappali Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
howard_wolowitz No.
leonard_hofstadter Not really.
sheldon_cooper You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.
penny So, you really gonna break up with her?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
penny Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter I stopped counting at four.
penny All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
leonard_hofstadter She meant Emily.
penny No, I, I really didn’t.
emily_sweeney You’re seriously breaking up with me?
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
emily_sweeney And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?
raj_koothrappali You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?
claire Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.
raj_koothrappali But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
claire Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass.
raj_koothrappali Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
raj_koothrappali I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you were right, tears.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.
sheldon_cooper I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.
amy_farrah_fowler People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around.
sheldon_cooper Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you mean?
sheldon_cooper Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. That is so sweet.
sheldon_cooper So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
amy_farrah_fowler Catchy.
howard_wolowitz I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t make it too hot.
howard_wolowitz Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look at that, you shaved it all.
howard_wolowitz You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?
bernadette_rostenkowski Ew, really? Get it out.
howard_wolowitz How?
bernadette_rostenkowski Uh, wish we had a skimmer.
howard_wolowitz Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know how to turn off the jets.
howard_wolowitz Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.
penny An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
leonard_hofstadter I know.
penny So what did you say?
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.
penny All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?
leonard_hofstadter Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?
penny Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
leonard_hofstadter A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
penny Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
glenn_the_maitre_d I’m afraid so.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
glenn_the_maitre_d Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 I did.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I took care of it.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live.
sheldon_cooper Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…
amy_farrah_fowler And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
amy_farrah_fowler Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers.
sheldon_cooper It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.
amy_farrah_fowler Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
sheldon_cooper Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?
raj_koothrappali What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh?
raj_koothrappali Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?
amy_farrah_fowler I, I think it starts with good communication.
sheldon_cooper You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.
howard_wolowitz I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.
howard_wolowitz Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.
howard_wolowitz Well, how do we do that?
bernadette_rostenkowski Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.
howard_wolowitz Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check.
bernadette_rostenkowski Anything else?
howard_wolowitz To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.
penny This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.
leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna say?
penny I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.
penny I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
leonard_hofstadter See if you can get a table by the window.
penny Hi there. What’s your name?
glenn_the_maitre_d Glen.
penny Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?
glenn_the_maitre_d Well, you know, Valentine’s Day.
penny Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…
glenn_the_maitre_d With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.
penny You don’t have to call me ma’am.
glenn_the_maitre_d Okay.
penny I mean, we’re basically the same age.
glenn_the_maitre_d Okay.
penny How old are you?
glenn_the_maitre_d I’m 21. How old are you?
penny Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here.
leonard_hofstadter What? Why?
penny Because I’m young. Let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.
raj_koothrappali You really think so?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.
amy_farrah_fowler Your friend is hurting.
raj_koothrappali No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
sheldon_cooper I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
barry_kripke Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.
raj_koothrappali Kripke? Is that you?
barry_kripke Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.
sheldon_cooper Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.
barry_kripke Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?
sheldon_cooper I don’t see why not.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s eating. That’s a good sign.
howard_wolowitz You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s pretty cute.
howard_wolowitz He is. Should we name him?
bernadette_rostenkowski It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?
howard_wolowitz Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you okay?
howard_wolowitz No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?
howard_wolowitz Poor judgement, obviously.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.
howard_wolowitz How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?
penny It is freaking amazing.
leonard_hofstadter Well, glad you’re feeling better.
penny I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.
leonard_hofstadter Is that a big deal?
penny Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
leonard_hofstadter Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…
penny Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.
penny Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.
leonard_hofstadter No, they’re not.
penny You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
leonard_hofstadter Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.
penny Won’t make us any younger.
leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.
penny Okay, like what?
leonard_hofstadter I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.
sheldon_cooper Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.
raj_koothrappali But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.
sheldon_cooper And actually, it was three different men.
barry_kripke Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
barry_kripke No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here.
amy_farrah_fowler Now?
barry_kripke Yup.
amy_farrah_fowler Now?
barry_kripke Yup.
amy_farrah_fowler Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
raj_koothrappali Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again.
sheldon_cooper Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.
amy_farrah_fowler I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…
raj_koothrappali Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents.
amy_farrah_fowler …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
barry_kripke Hey, I think I got cut off.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Kripke.
barry_kripke I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?
leonard_hofstadter Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.
leonard_hofstadter Are you actually gonna dance?
leonard_hofstadter Of course.
penny Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.
penny Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
leonard_hofstadter That sounds fun. When’s it start?
penny Midnight.
leonard_hofstadter Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.
penny Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, thank God.
penny Yes.
howard_wolowitz It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, terrific.
howard_wolowitz It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me.
bernadette_rostenkowski If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested.
howard_wolowitz Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is.
howard_wolowitz He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
howard_wolowitz No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
bernadette_rostenkowski We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant.
raj_koothrappali I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much.
amy_farrah_fowler It really can.
sheldon_cooper All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
amy_farrah_fowler No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
sheldon_cooper Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us.
barry_kripke Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m just gonna push all the buttons.
sheldon_cooper Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
amy_farrah_fowler So do I.
sheldon_cooper When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…
leonard_hofstadter@penny Happy Valentine’s Day!
leonard_hofstadter We are young and fun.
sheldon_cooper I stand corrected. Fun.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations on a successful live show.
amy_farrah_fowler And a lovely Valentine’s Day.
penny Cleaning up is not young and fun.
leonard_hofstadter It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
sheldon_cooper Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
amy_farrah_fowler Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
sheldon_cooper I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.
