amy_farrah_fowler Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?
raj_koothrappali He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.
penny I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.
raj_koothrappali Have you heard from Howard?
bernadette_rostenkowski I did. His talk at NASA went great.
penny Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.
stuart_bloom Hey, guys.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hi.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Stuart.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart!
stuart_bloom How’s it going?
raj_koothrappali Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.
stuart_bloom Oh, how is it?
penny Disgusting. Do not tell him.
leonard_hofstadter What do you guys want to do tonight?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.
raj_koothrappali Stuart? Are you okay?
stuart_bloom No, I don’t feel so…
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, Stuart?
penny Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
raj_koothrappali Stuart?
leonard_hofstadter Calling 911.
raj_koothrappali Well, it’s too late.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean it’s too late?
raj_koothrappali He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on.
raj_koothrappali Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m leaving.
raj_koothrappali You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, it’s Bloom.
penny Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
stuart_bloom What do you think I was gonna do at home?
penny Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
raj_koothrappali Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?
penny You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
penny That kind of actress. This sucks.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.
amy_farrah_fowler I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
raj_koothrappali Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, ugh.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?
raj_koothrappali Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
bernadette_rostenkowski What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
raj_koothrappali Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
amy_farrah_fowler According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.
raj_koothrappali Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
penny Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?
raj_koothrappali Any question but that.
penny Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?
stuart_bloom Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
bernadette_rostenkowski What do you care? You’re dead.
stuart_bloom Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for my bobble head.
howard_wolowitz Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
sheldon_cooper It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?
howard_wolowitz We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.
sheldon_cooper I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
howard_wolowitz Oh, boy.
sheldon_cooper Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
howard_wolowitz I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, what happens next?
raj_koothrappali I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
penny Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
raj_koothrappali Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.
penny Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
raj_koothrappali Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.
bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know you were fat.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.
amy_farrah_fowler That is so sweet.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
raj_koothrappali No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s it for?
bernadette_rostenkowski For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.
raj_koothrappali From the future? How fun and imaginative.
leonard_hofstadter So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
raj_koothrappali Correct.
leonard_hofstadter Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?
raj_koothrappali Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
penny I’m gonna need another clue.
howard_wolowitz Okay, give me the flowers and pie.
sheldon_cooper But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.
howard_wolowitz They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper Nothing.
howard_wolowitz What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.
sheldon_cooper I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
howard_wolowitz You ready to talk about it?
sheldon_cooper I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
howard_wolowitz Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?
sheldon_cooper No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
howard_wolowitz Well, did she see you in the window?
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz Then don’t say anything.
sheldon_cooper I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?
howard_wolowitz Well, don’t do it on the phone.
sheldon_cooper No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.
howard_wolowitz That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.
howard_wolowitz Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.
sheldon_cooper I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.
raj_koothrappali Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.
penny Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.
stuart_bloom Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
raj_koothrappali Fine, just try not to look too alive.
stuart_bloom That’s my jam.
bernadette_rostenkowski So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
amy_farrah_fowler But why?
raj_koothrappali Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.
penny Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.
penny Hmm.
bernadette_rostenkowski So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
raj_koothrappali Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
amy_farrah_fowler What does your card say, Bernadette?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?
penny Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.
leonard_hofstadter But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
penny Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you don’t go into science for the money.
bernadette_rostenkowski Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
penny So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?
amy_farrah_fowler Dun, dun, dun. He started it.
raj_koothrappali Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
penny Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
sheldon_cooper Okay, let’s do this.
howard_wolowitz Good luck.
sheldon_cooper You, aren’t you gonna come with me?
howard_wolowitz While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
sheldon_cooper Mother? Mother? Mother?
mary_cooper Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.
sheldon_cooper I saw you having naked sex.
mary_cooper What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
mary_cooper Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
sheldon_cooper Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
mary_cooper That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
sheldon_cooper Who was he?
mary_cooper His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
sheldon_cooper How long have you been involved with him?
mary_cooper A few months.
sheldon_cooper And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
mary_cooper That is no way to speak to your mother.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.
mary_cooper I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
sheldon_cooper Or what?
mary_cooper Or I will send you to your room.
sheldon_cooper That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
mary_cooper Go to your room.
sheldon_cooper But I occupy the moral high ground.
mary_cooper Go to your room.
sheldon_cooper But I’m a professional scientist.
mrs#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 Go to your room!
sheldon_cooper I’m a grown man.
raj_koothrappali Can we please get back to the game?
leonard_hofstadter In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
penny Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
leonard_hofstadter Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.
penny In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?
stuart_bloom I think you and Leonard will be together.
penny You do?
stuart_bloom Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.
leonard_hofstadter Aw.
penny That’s so sweet.
bernadette_rostenkowski What the hell?
amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me?
penny Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?
stuart_bloom Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.
penny Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on.
bernadette_rostenkowski Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.
howard_wolowitz Hey, can I come in?
sheldon_cooper Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
howard_wolowitz That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.
sheldon_cooper No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
howard_wolowitz You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.
sheldon_cooper Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
howard_wolowitz I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
sheldon_cooper I didn’t know she did.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.
sheldon_cooper What did you do?
howard_wolowitz Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.
howard_wolowitz All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
sheldon_cooper You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
howard_wolowitz And the healing begins.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
mary_cooper Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
sheldon_cooper I am.
mary_cooper Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
sheldon_cooper I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?
mary_cooper You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.
sheldon_cooper Then why are you doing it?
mary_cooper Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.
sheldon_cooper Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.
mary_cooper That is very Christian of you.
sheldon_cooper Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.
mary_cooper How old do you think I am?
sheldon_cooper My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.
mary_cooper Are you having the sex talk with me?
sheldon_cooper Well, someone has to.
mary_cooper Oh, dear Lord.
sheldon_cooper No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.
penny Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.
raj_koothrappali I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
amy_farrah_fowler It actually was kind of fun.
raj_koothrappali You’re just saying that.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski I liked the time travel element.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
leonard_hofstadter It was. By Terminator.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.
penny Definitely.
leonard_hofstadter Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw.
penny I love it.
leonard_hofstadter Putting it in my phone right now.
penny Yeah, me, too.
stuart_bloom My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.
raj_koothrappali And it’s done.
penny Yup, we’re all in.
leonard_hofstadter All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.
stuart_bloom I knew it.
