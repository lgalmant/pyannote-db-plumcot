leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hi, how was the screening?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.
penny Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.
leonard_hofstadter How’d it go with my mother?
penny Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. Well done.
penny Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.
leonard_hofstadter Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.
penny No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, we’re gonna get married again?
penny Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.
leonard_hofstadter Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
penny Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.
leonard_hofstadter Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her.
penny Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?
leonard_hofstadter I just said why, we don’t like her.
penny Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.
leonard_hofstadter Is your brother out of prison?
penny Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.
leonard_hofstadter I’d love it if my dad could come.
penny Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.
penny Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.
penny Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.
amy_farrah_fowler So there’s no maid of honour?
penny No.
amy_farrah_fowler Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?
penny I don’t see how I could.
amy_farrah_fowler Then I graciously accept.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s going to officiate?
penny I was kind of hoping you would.
amy_farrah_fowler Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?
sheldon_cooper Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
penny Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s Erno Rubik?
sheldon_cooper Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.
penny Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?
sheldon_cooper Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother.
penny Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.
dr_beverly_hofstadter How dare you invite your father without consulting me.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.
dr_beverly_hofstadter You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.
leonard_hofstadter I know, and there’s no excuse for that.
dr_beverly_hofstadter He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years.
leonard_hofstadter I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God. It’s working.
raj_koothrappali You sure?
howard_wolowitz Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.
raj_koothrappali You’re right. You realize what this means?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.
raj_koothrappali Congratulations.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.
raj_koothrappali Open it.
howard_wolowitz Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird.
raj_koothrappali Is there a window around here we don’t know about?
howard_wolowitz I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.
mary_cooper Thank you for picking me up.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re welcome.
mary_cooper I was speaking to your young lady.
amy_farrah_fowler My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.
mary_cooper Oh, please call me Mary.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, Mary.
sheldon_cooper You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.
mary_cooper Sheldon, don’t be silly.
sheldon_cooper Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.
mary_cooper It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.
sheldon_cooper Well, actually, I…
amy_farrah_fowler It sure was.
mary_cooper I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, I take care of him.
mary_cooper Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here.
mary_cooper Oh, Beverly. How nice.
amy_farrah_fowler You’ve met her, right?
mary_cooper Yes, I have.
sheldon_cooper Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.
mary_cooper Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic.
dr_beverly_hofstadter So, Mary, how have you been?
mary_cooper Well, thank you so much for asking. I’ve been well, and you?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Very good.
mary_cooper Good.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great.
mary_cooper Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming.
dr_beverly_hofstadter My ex-husband.
mary_cooper Oh, I’m so sorry.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Don’t be.
mary_cooper All right.
penny Whew, chilly.
amy_farrah_fowler I think I can see my breath.
dr_beverly_hofstadter We can hear you.
penny Sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry.
howard_wolowitz I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting.
howard_wolowitz Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.
raj_koothrappali Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.
howard_wolowitz Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.
bernadette_rostenkowski You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, you find this funny?
raj_koothrappali No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, we have to use the stairs.
dr_alfred_hofstadter When are they gonna fix your elevator?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I don’t, any day now.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Ah, she’s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, Dad.
dr_alfred_hofstadter How the hell did you do that?
sheldon_cooper Isn’t this nice?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, we’re here.
penny Alfred. Thank you for coming!
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Dad, you remember Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Dr. Hofstadter.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Dr. Cooper.
leonard_hofstadter This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary.
dr_alfred_hofstadter How do you do?
mary_cooper Nice to meet you.
leonard_hofstadter And his girlfriend, Amy.
dr_alfred_hofstadter A pleasure.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
leonard_hofstadter And, of course, Mom.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Hello, my hateful shrew.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.
sheldon_cooper All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension.
leonard_hofstadter All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Of course. I’m sorry.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, look at that, you can apologize.
leonard_hofstadter Mom.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m sorry.
mary_cooper You know, the Bible says forgiveness…
sheldon_cooper Mom.
mary_cooper I’m sorry.
penny Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
sheldon_cooper It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I’m not sorry. That’s true.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?
raj_koothrappali You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
bernadette_rostenkowski Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner.
howard_wolowitz One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it.
raj_koothrappali Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you done with this nonsense?
howard_wolowitz It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.
raj_koothrappali Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.
howard_wolowitz You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.
raj_koothrappali I also love the enemies of America.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another.
penny No, of course not.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.
leonard_hofstadter Mom, please save something for the toast.
mary_cooper So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, I’m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.
mary_cooper My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.
sheldon_cooper Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking.
amy_farrah_fowler Play with your phone.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.
mary_cooper I don’t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that’s very interesting.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh. I, I didn’t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
mary_cooper Really?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Yes. Yes, I’m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.
mary_cooper Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.
raj_koothrappali Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
raj_koothrappali What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.
howard_wolowitz I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you.
raj_koothrappali I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
penny You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Is that Howard in front of us?
penny Oh, maybe. Get closer.
howard_wolowitz Oh, God. I think someone’s following us.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re being ridiculous.
howard_wolowitz I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail.
raj_koothrappali Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.
penny Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.
penny Oh, so follow him.
raj_koothrappali Oh, no.
howard_wolowitz I told you.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.
penny Well, go faster. You’re losing him.
leonard_hofstadter What is his hurry?
penny You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you.
howard_wolowitz He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?
raj_koothrappali I, I think he wants us to pull over.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.
howard_wolowitz Hang on.
dr_alfred_hofstadter So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?
mary_cooper No, just focused on work and the church.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Ah. And what do you do?
mary_cooper I work at the church.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, they’re lucky to have you.
mary_cooper Well, thank you.
dr_alfred_hofstadter You’re welcome.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you realize what’s happening here?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler What took you guys so long?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.
penny So, what did we miss?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.
mary_cooper Leonard, your father is just charming.
dr_beverly_hofstadter He’s also broke. Did he mention that?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Mom, you sit over there.
penny Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.
sheldon_cooper If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while.
howard_wolowitz I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.
mary_cooper Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father.
sheldon_cooper That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.
amy_farrah_fowler I’d be lost without you.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
sheldon_cooper See, that’s funny because…
amy_farrah_fowler Back to your phone.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.
penny Oh, thanks for asking until I did.
amy_farrah_fowler Hear, hear.
leonard_hofstadter Cheers.
dr_alfred_hofstadter I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.
penny Aw.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.
dr_beverly_hofstadter What the hell is that supposed to mean?
dr_alfred_hofstadter Why don’t you take a pill?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Like you did before sex?
dr_alfred_hofstadter What I really needed was a blindfold.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?
mary_cooper When God writes one, I will.
penny Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Leonard, if you don’t mind, I, I think I’m a little tired. I’m gonna call it a night.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, Dad.
mary_cooper I’m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Would you like to share a cab?
mary_cooper That would be fine.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Where are you staying?
mary_cooper I’m at the Westin.
dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?
mary_cooper I think that you could.
leonard_hofstadter What is happening there?
sheldon_cooper I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
sheldon_cooper She’s still not answering.
leonard_hofstadter My father’s not texting me back.
penny ‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
sheldon_cooper I don’t like this at all.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t like it either.
penny Really? ‘Cause I love it.
