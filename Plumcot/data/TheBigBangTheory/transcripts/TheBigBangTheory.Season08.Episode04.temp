leonard Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
sheldon Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.
howard What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
sheldon Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.
raj Hey, guys.
howard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
raj We still on for tomorrow night?
leonard Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
sheldon Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.
howard Since when do you read social science?
sheldon I go to the bathroom like everybody else.
raj Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
leonard Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.
raj You guys kiss and hold hands.
leonard I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.
raj Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.
leonard What happens if she doesn’t like us?
raj Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.
amy So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?
howard I don’t want to talk about it.
bernadette But he’s going to.
howard My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.
bernadette Long story short, they have seven HBOs.
raj Hey, guys.
sheldon Hello.
raj Emily, you know almost everybody here.
emily Hi.
raj And this is Leonard, this is Penny.
emily Oh, it’s so nice to meet you.
leonard Nice to finally meet you, too.
penny Hi.
emily Hello.
leonard Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.
raj I told you she exists.
penny Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.
emily Uh, yeah, I’m a resident at Huntington Hospital.
sheldon Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.
bernadette You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.
penny Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.
emily Yeah. I’m sure that’d be fine.
sheldon I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
emily Um, okay, I guess.
amy I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off.
bernadette Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?
penny I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
bernadette Did she say she didn’t like you?
penny Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.
amy We have led different lives.
bernadette You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?
penny It’s just this vibe I got.
bernadette I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.
penny Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.
bernadette Really?
penny Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.
bernadette When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine.
penny Yeah, I hope you’re right.
amy You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?
penny Yeah.
amy I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.
sheldon I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?
howard Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.
leonard Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.
howard Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?
raj You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.
sheldon Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.
leonard Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?
howard All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?
sheldon For starters, they shed and bite.
leonard Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?
raj So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?
leonard It’s kind of a dream come true.
howard That does sound fun.
raj Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
sheldon I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.
leonard It’s not that bad.
penny Hey.
emily Hi.
penny Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
emily Sure.
penny Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.
emily Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy.
penny Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.
emily Great.
penny So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.
emily All right.
penny It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.
emily Funny.
penny Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.
emily No, it’s fine.
penny Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?
emily Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.
penny Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?
emily Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.
penny What? Oh, why would he say that?
emily Did it not happen?
penny Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.
emily Did you kiss?
penny Yeah.
emily Were you naked?
penny Yeah.
emily So, it was a hook-up.
penny No. Yeah.
sheldon So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?
leonard Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.
howard You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.
raj Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?
sheldon Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?
howard Toy stores, puppet shows.
leonard Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?
sheldon Yes.
leonard And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
raj We are now.
penny You told Emily we hooked up?
raj Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.
penny Why would you say that?
raj We were having a conversation about past lovers.
penny We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?
raj Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?
leonard Why say it?
penny Yes.
raj Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.
penny Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.
raj Great.
sheldon On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.
raj You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.
sheldon No. You’re crazy about me.
penny I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.
amy Hmm-hmm.
penny Almost everyone has a past.
bernadette Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you.
penny It’s not.
bernadette And I’m sure you can turn it around.
penny How? You can’t force someone to like you.
amy What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.
penny No, that won’t work.
amy You’re right. Cheers.
bernadette Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?
penny What?
bernadette Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.
penny It’s stupid.
bernadette Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas.
amy I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.
penny Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you.
amy Shh. Amy’s here now.
sheldon You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.
howard We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
sheldon And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.
howard You say things like that all the time.
sheldon Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.
leonard Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?
howard Yeah.
leonard Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?
sheldon I’m sure she did.
leonard Why?
sheldon Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list.
leonard Will you stay out of this?
sheldon If only Penny had said that once in a while.
howard Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry.
leonard That’s true.
howard Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.
sheldon Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.
leonard Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.
sheldon I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.
howard He’s right.
sheldon Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.
leonard There’s something I wanted to run past you.
penny What’s up?
leonard Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?
penny Why are you asking me?
leonard Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.
penny Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?
leonard Yeah.
penny Huh.
howard Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.
bernadette Nope.
howard But you didn’t hear what it was.
bernadette I know.
howard Oh, come on.
bernadette Fine. What is it?
howard It’s to help reopen the comic book store.
bernadette Nope.
howard Well, hear me out.
bernadette Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house.
howard I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money.
bernadette It just seems like a risky investment.
howard I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.
bernadette Oh. Howie, I had no idea.
howard Well, I don’t like to talk about it.
bernadette Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?
howard That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.
sheldon I’d like your honest opinion on something.
amy Of course.
sheldon Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.
amy I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.
sheldon Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store.
amy Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?
sheldon No.
amy Then I think it’s a terrific idea.
sheldon Great. Wait till you hear about our van.
raj Hey.
penny Hi.
raj Thanks for inviting us over.
penny Oh, thank you for coming.
emily Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.
penny No, no. No need to apologise.
raj Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?
penny Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.
raj It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.
penny Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.
emily Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.
penny Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.
raj It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.
stuart So, what brings you by?
howard Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house.
stuart Technically, it’s your mom’s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.
howard I’m always welcome.
stuart Mm, just try and call first.
bernadette Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.
stuart Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.
howard What?
stuart Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.
howard Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala.
stuart I don’t know who he’s talking to. She’s at Target, buying me shirts.
raj I’m so glad we could work this all out.
penny Yeah, me, too.
emily You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.
penny Oh, we would love that.
raj Great.
penny Okay, good night, guys.
emily All right, night.
penny Bye.
emily_and_penny I hate her.
raj I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
leonard I know. I was looking forward to it.
sheldon It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.
howard With comfy seats.
raj And snacks.
sheldon Well, I guess it was too good to be true.
leonard Yeah.
