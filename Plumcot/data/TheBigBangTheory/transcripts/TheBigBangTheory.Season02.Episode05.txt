sheldon_cooper Good morning, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not going to work.
sheldon_cooper Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
sheldon_cooper Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Then you can drive. Let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements.
sheldon_cooper You did.
leonard_hofstadter And?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t. Let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter Goodnight, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper But how am I going to get to work?
leonard_hofstadter Take the bus.
sheldon_cooper I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
leonard_hofstadter You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.
sheldon_cooper Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny…
penny Sheldon, what is it?
sheldon_cooper Leonard’s asleep.
penny Thanks for the update
sheldon_cooper No, wait. You have to drive me to work.
penny Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do.
sheldon_cooper But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.
penny Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?
sheldon_cooper Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
penny Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
sheldon_cooper Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
penny Oh, dear God.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for driving me to work.
penny You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.
penny Mm-hmm.
sheldon_cooper Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.
penny It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.
sheldon_cooper Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.
penny Sheldon, it’s fine.
sheldon_cooper If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine.
penny Uh, maybe the light’s broken.
sheldon_cooper Is there a “check the check engine light light”? O-o-o-oh!
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
penny Do you have any alcohol?
sheldon_cooper Of course not.
penny Too bad.
sheldon_cooper You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
penny Mm-hmm.
sheldon_cooper Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
penny Well, good for Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh. Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium,you say Manganese,and I say Europium,and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?
penny How about we just have a little quiet time now?
sheldon_cooper All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
penny Get out.
sheldon_cooper Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.
penny I said, get out.
sheldon_cooper Okay. I’ll give it a shot.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.
leonard_hofstadter I just got here.
sheldon_cooper Good, perfect timing.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks.
sheldon_cooper No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, help me out here.
howard_wolowitz No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.
sheldon_cooper Now, how do you propose I get home?
leonard_hofstadter How did you get here in the first place?
sheldon_cooper Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
howard_wolowitz Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.
sheldon_cooper Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
raj_koothrappali Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
sheldon_cooper We had a difference of opinion.
raj_koothrappali Over what?
sheldon_cooper Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?
raj_koothrappali I’m taking you home.
sheldon_cooper Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
raj_koothrappali I have a better idea.
sheldon_cooper You want to go to pottery barn first?
sheldon_cooper Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.
sheldon_cooper Good morning.
all@ Good morning.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, sit down.
sheldon_cooper She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.
penny Sheldon,you know that we care about you.
howard_wolowitz And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
penny You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.
leonard_hofstadter So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
sheldon_cooper Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.
howard_wolowitz This madness has to stop.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed.
sheldon_cooper Why Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.
penny All right, come on Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hold on, I have one condition.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper And Radio Shack.
penny Fine.
sheldon_cooper And the comic book store.
penny All right!
howard_wolowitz Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store.
raj_koothrappali I like comic books.
sheldon_cooper I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.
penny Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
sheldon_cooper I was otherwise engaged.
penny Doing what?
sheldon_cooper Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
penny Well, how ’bout when you were 17?
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! Application?
sheldon_cooper I’m actually more of a theorist.
howard_wolowitz The application in your hand, give it to her.
sheldon_cooper Oh.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Look at that sign up there.
sheldon_cooper Yes?
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Does it say I give a damn?
sheldon_cooper No.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 That’s because I don’t.
sheldon_cooper Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Look at the sign.
penny Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.
sheldon_cooper I don’t need your help, Penny.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!
sheldon_cooper No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?
sheldon_cooper How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.
sheldon_cooper But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Don’t make me climb over this counter.
penny Come on, let’s go.
dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Next!
sheldon_cooper Aced it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up.
leonard_hofstadter Booting.
howard_wolowitz This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
sheldon_cooper Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
howard_wolowitz I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see…
sheldon_cooper Ooh!
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
sheldon_cooper Hmmmm?
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz.
howard_wolowitz Fine, what colour do you want?
sheldon_cooper You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?
howard_wolowitz Black it is.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
sheldon_cooper I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fasten your seat belt.
sheldon_cooper Click. Now, are there air bags?
leonard_hofstadter You don’t need air bags.
sheldon_cooper What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
penny I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
howard_wolowitz Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Watch out.
howard_wolowitz Oh God!
leonard_hofstadter Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
penny Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
leonard_hofstadter How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper No. I quit.
leonard_hofstadter Aw, the pet store?
sheldon_cooper Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed.
leonard_hofstadter So wait,you’re just gonna give up?
sheldon_cooper No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.
leonard_hofstadter So what is it you’re doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
leonard_hofstadter I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
sheldon_cooper Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.
leonard_hofstadter No kidding.
sheldon_cooper Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
sheldon_cooper No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
leonard_hofstadter It’s never safe.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I know that now.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
sheldon_cooper Homo Novus doesn’t know.
leonard_hofstadter Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.
sheldon_cooper Good morning, gentlemen.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
raj_koothrappali Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
leonard_hofstadter No, he lives here now.
howard_wolowitz Really? Why?
leonard_hofstadter Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment.
raj_koothrappali But you finished your experiment a week ago.
leonard_hofstadter Yep
cleaning_lady_1#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Oh my God, again?
cleaning_lady_2#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 It must be rats.
cleaning_lady_1#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust.
sheldon_cooper You saw nothing!
