sheldon_cooper It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.
leonard_hofstadter What are you grinding about?
sheldon_cooper Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like.
leonard_hofstadter Just let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we? Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend.
leonard_hofstadter They slept together, Sherlock.
sheldon_cooper No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like.
leonard_hofstadter She lied.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?
howard_wolowitz Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?
leonard_hofstadter No, I’m fine with it.
sheldon_cooper That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell is wrong with you?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, how could you do that?
raj_koothrappali What is it to you?
howard_wolowitz I got his back.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard.
howard_wolowitz Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.
leonard_hofstadter Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.
raj_koothrappali Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me.
howard_wolowitz You’re not in love with Penny.
raj_koothrappali Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.
howard_wolowitz Who?
raj_koothrappali He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.
leonard_hofstadter Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. What?
raj_koothrappali Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
raj_koothrappali That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
sheldon_cooper For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing.
penny Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.
amy_farrah_fowler Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.
penny You heard what I did?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I heard who you did.
penny Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?
penny No.
amy_farrah_fowler She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.
penny I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?
amy_farrah_fowler She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.
bernadette_rostenkowski You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!
raj_koothrappali Please, come in.
bernadette_rostenkowski What the hell is wrong with you?
raj_koothrappali Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m nice to everyone.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry.
bernadette_rostenkowski Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us.
raj_koothrappali I will. Hey, Bernadette?
bernadette_rostenkowski What?!
raj_koothrappali Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
bernadette_rostenkowski Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
penny You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.
amy_farrah_fowler You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.
penny You know what? Let’s get out of here.
amy_farrah_fowler Where are we going?
penny Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.
sheldon_cooper Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?
penny Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
amy_farrah_fowler Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.
penny Yeah, sure. Yay!
amy_farrah_fowler We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op.
penny Sounds great.
amy_farrah_fowler Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.
penny Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag.
amy_farrah_fowler No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.
leonard_hofstadter Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
sheldon_cooper Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not in the mood, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk to Amy.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not Amy.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello, dear.
leonard_hofstadter You called my mother?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?
dr_beverly_hofstadter He’s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on? What do you want?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I’m here to help.
leonard_hofstadter That’s so nice.
dr_beverly_hofstadter And we’re back to the obvious. Now, what’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I understand.
leonard_hofstadter Got any advice?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Yes. Buck up.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.
dr_beverly_hofstadter If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.
amy_farrah_fowler Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.
penny You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.
penny I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I can’t let you do that.
penny Why not?
amy_farrah_fowler For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.
raj_koothrappali Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?
amy_farrah_fowler A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
penny How did you know I was here?
raj_koothrappali It’s all over her Facebook page.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
penny Thanks.
amy_farrah_fowler No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?
penny So, hi. What’s up?
raj_koothrappali I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.
penny Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…
raj_koothrappali Aw, there’s a thing.
penny Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships.
raj_koothrappali You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
penny Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.
raj_koothrappali Oh. All right.
penny Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense.
penny Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?
raj_koothrappali No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.
penny Oh, you did, didn’t you?
raj_koothrappali Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.
penny So, we didn’t actually…
raj_koothrappali I did. It was beautiful.
penny Oh!
raj_koothrappali Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.
penny Of course I won’t. No, I won’t.
raj_koothrappali Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?
penny Sure.
raj_koothrappali Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?
penny No.
raj_koothrappali Can I say I ruined you for white men?
penny Also no.
raj_koothrappali Okay, just the candle thing.
penny Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Cool. All right friend.
penny Hmm.
raj_koothrappali I’ll see you around.
penny Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend.
raj_koothrappali Penny?
penny Mm-hmm?
raj_koothrappali It’s getting beautiful again.
sheldon_cooper All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.
howard_wolowitz I don’t see anything.
sheldon_cooper Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
howard_wolowitz Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
raj_koothrappali Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?
howard_wolowitz Fine with me.
raj_koothrappali Sure, whatever.
sheldon_cooper You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games.
sheldon_cooper This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, no and no.
sheldon_cooper Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.
howard_wolowitz Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.
sheldon_cooper No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. Geology isn’t a real science!
howard_wolowitz Damn those sons of bitches!
leonard_hofstadter Let’s get ’em!
sheldon_cooper If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!
leonard_hofstadter I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.
howard_wolowitz@raj_koothrappali Here, here.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal.
penny Hi. You guys have a minute?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, sure.
penny Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.
raj_koothrappali Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.
penny Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?
raj_koothrappali Sorry. Go on.
penny Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska.
leonard_hofstadter You’re leaving?
penny Yeah.
howard_wolowitz What are you going to do in Nebraska?
penny I don’t know, maybe teach acting. Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?
leonard_hofstadter Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman.
penny Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
sheldon_cooper What about Nebraska?
penny Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!
sheldon_cooper Have you ever thought of teaching physics?
actress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode01 Ready to ride?
penny I don’t think so, Mom. Not today.
actress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode01 Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?
penny You don’t know the half of it.
actress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode01 Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.
penny Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
actress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode01 Now, the H is for Her.
leonard_hofstadter I’m proud of you.
penny Shh! Here comes my joke.
actress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode01 How are you doing?
penny Sittin’ pretty.
