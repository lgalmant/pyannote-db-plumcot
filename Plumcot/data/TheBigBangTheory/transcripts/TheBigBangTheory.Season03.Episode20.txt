penny Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
sheldon_cooper Uh-oh.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I was going to get my mail.
penny Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
sheldon_cooper I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
penny God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
sheldon_cooper Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
penny Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
sheldon_cooper Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.
penny Really?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.
penny Right.
sheldon_cooper Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
penny Everyone.
sheldon_cooper Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.
penny Great.
sheldon_cooper Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.
penny So, how you been?
sheldon_cooper Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
penny You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?
sheldon_cooper Bazinga.
penny Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?
sheldon_cooper He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
penny I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.
sheldon_cooper I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
penny Yep.
sheldon_cooper That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.
penny Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
sheldon_cooper I’m hungry now.
penny Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?
sheldon_cooper Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
penny I don’t have hot dogs.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. .
leonard_hofstadter Hey, where you been?
sheldon_cooper I was talking with Penny.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
sheldon_cooper Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
howard_wolowitz So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.
sheldon_cooper Which one picks last?
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.
sheldon_cooper Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Why?
sheldon_cooper Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!
howard_wolowitz Oh, God, this is good.
raj_koothrappali Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
howard_wolowitz Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.
leonard_hofstadter Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
leonard_hofstadter So, you guys want to do something tonight?
howard_wolowitz Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.
leonard_hofstadter What about you, Raj?
raj_koothrappali Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.
leonard_hofstadter I never stopped hanging out with you.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman.
howard_wolowitz I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
raj_koothrappali What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?
sheldon_cooper Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.
leonard_hofstadter Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, since when do you take walks?
sheldon_cooper I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.
howard_wolowitz Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.
howard_wolowitz Or we could go together.
sheldon_cooper I can’t think of a reason why not.
howard_wolowitz Let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Hold on. Nope, no reason.
raj_koothrappali I’ve missed you.
sheldon_cooper All right, say hello to your mother for me.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
sheldon_cooper What?
howard_wolowitz You said you were going for a walk.
sheldon_cooper I didn’t say outside.
howard_wolowitz So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?
sheldon_cooper No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
woman Here Bubbles. Here boy.
howard_wolowitz Which way are you going?
sheldon_cooper Which way are you going?
howard_wolowitz I parked my scooter down the block.
sheldon_cooper I’m going the other way. Bye.
howard_wolowitz Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
sheldon_cooper No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
howard_wolowitz I definitely smell raw hot dog.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
howard_wolowitz All right, have a nice walk.
sheldon_cooper I shall. Have a nice scoot.
howard_wolowitz You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny. Penny. Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
raj_koothrappali I haven’t had sex in a year.
leonard_hofstadter Where you going with this, Raj?
raj_koothrappali Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
leonard_hofstadter So, go.
raj_koothrappali Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.
leonard_hofstadter And you think my presence will help with that?
raj_koothrappali Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not going out tonight, Raj.
raj_koothrappali All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
leonard_hofstadter Very much.
raj_koothrappali Doesn’t have to be Asian.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
raj_koothrappali No, I won’t.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
raj_koothrappali You really think so?
leonard_hofstadter I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
raj_koothrappali But we’ll have sex first, right?
sheldon_cooper Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.
penny So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
penny Well, good.
sheldon_cooper I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
penny He’s been crying?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.
penny Oh, God, I feel terrible.
sheldon_cooper Do you have a stomach ache, too?
penny No. Why, do you?
sheldon_cooper No.
penny Why did you ask if I had one, too?
sheldon_cooper Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
penny All right. So, what’s new in your life?
sheldon_cooper Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
penny Have you been running?
sheldon_cooper No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
penny I’m so glad you like it.
sheldon_cooper I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
penny Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.
sheldon_cooper You can’t cook and you made me this.
penny Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.
raj_koothrappali Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
leonard_hofstadter I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
raj_koothrappali You don’t know that. Prison changes people.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, where you been?
sheldon_cooper I told you, walking.
leonard_hofstadter For an hour and a half?
sheldon_cooper I got lost.
leonard_hofstadter How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
sheldon_cooper Satellites are down. Solar flares.
raj_koothrappali There are no solar flares right now.
sheldon_cooper Yes, there are.
raj_koothrappali Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell was that about?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, we really need to get you a girl.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, just come in!
sheldon_cooper Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Maybe this isn’t a good time.
leonard_hofstadter Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
sheldon_cooper Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want?
sheldon_cooper You may want to sit down.
leonard_hofstadter I’m in bed!
sheldon_cooper Point taken. You may want to sit up.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?
sheldon_cooper We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
sheldon_cooper I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
leonard_hofstadter Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
leonard_hofstadter Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
leonard_hofstadter I guess not.
sheldon_cooper And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
penny Oh, um, I, I can come back.
leonard_hofstadter D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.
penny Yeah, I guess you’re right.
leonard_hofstadter You used to it yet?
penny Nope.
leonard_hofstadter Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.
penny Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.
leonard_hofstadter His mother?
penny Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
leonard_hofstadter I was going to do that.
penny Oh, well, then you, you do it.
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.
penny Okay, you can take him for shoes.
leonard_hofstadter I just took him for shoes.
penny Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
penny Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
leonard_hofstadter You’re taking him to Disneyland?
penny Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
leonard_hofstadter All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
penny We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.
leonard_hofstadter All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
penny Okay, whatever.
leonard_hofstadter And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
penny All right, got it. Is there anything else?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.
penny What’s the problem with Goofy?
leonard_hofstadter Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
raj_koothrappali Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
howard_wolowitz Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about.
penny We’re home.
leonard_hofstadter It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?
sheldon_cooper We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
leonard_hofstadter I was going to see that with him.
penny How was I supposed to know that?
sheldon_cooper It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
leonard_hofstadter And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
penny I know, I know.
sheldon_cooper I can still eat.
penny No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
sheldon_cooper Okay, but just don’t fight
leonard_hofstadter We’re not fighting.
penny Just go.
leonard_hofstadter Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Penny.
penny You’re welcome, sweetie.
leonard_hofstadter Want a cup of coffee?
penny Oh, um, I should probably get going.
leonard_hofstadter Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
penny Yep, okay.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.
leonard_hofstadter What am I smelling?
penny Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
penny He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
penny I think we can do it.
leonard_hofstadter Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
penny No, be friends. You and me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
penny Good. I’m glad.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.
penny Good night, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
sheldon_cooper No, Goofy, no.
