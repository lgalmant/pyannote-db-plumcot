sheldon Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?
amy I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
sheldon But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.
amy And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.
sheldon So as they say, all good things must come to an end.
amy After only 232 episodes.
sheldon 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
amy You said you weren’t gonna bring that up.
sheldon And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?
amy That was a good one.
sheldon It was so good.
raj You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.
howard Doesn’t Professor Abbott’s family want any of this stuff?
leonard I don’t think he had a family.
raj That’s rough.
leonard I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box.
howard Makes you think. Oh, well.
leonard Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important.
howard I did. It’s all outdated or disproved.
raj I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
howard Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.
leonard It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
howard Don’t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.
leonard That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.
howard That’s intense.
raj Poor Roger Abbott.
howard Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
raj Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.
dan Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.
penny Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine.
dan Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.
penny Aw.
dan Yes. Why don’t you come over to my table.
penny I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car.
dan Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.
penny Come on. She’s not that bad.
dan Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.
penny I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…
bernadette Hey, what are you talking about?
penny Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?
sheldon Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.
amy And, yes, even shed a tear or two.
sheldon Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
amy How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
sheldon How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
sheldon Crikey, what flag do we have today?
amy Australia, mate.
sheldon And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
kripke Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.
amy Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?
sheldon I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
amy Then who did sew it, hmm?
sheldon Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
sheldon Fancy a dip, my dear?
amy I do.
sheldon Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.
amy Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
sheldon No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
kripke Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.
raj When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?
howard Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?
raj Wrong, smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.
leonard Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
howard Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
leonard Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?
raj Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.
leonard This has to mean something.
howard Well, there’s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check.
leonard Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.
howard Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
leonard Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.
howard Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.
raj Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
howard Oh, let’s do that.
leonard Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?
howard Yeah, I’m not even sure if it’s the right word.
penny So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?
dan Seven.
bernadette Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.
penny I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
bernadette Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”
dan I need another drink.
bernadette What’s his problem?
penny Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.
bernadette Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.
penny Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.
bernadette What? I’m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.
penny Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean.
bernadette Oh, yeah? You one of those people?
penny No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.
amy Action.
sheldon Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.
levar_burton Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.
sheldon You do this, I delete your contact information.
levar While?
sheldon While you watch me do it.
levar Great. Happy to be back.
sheldon Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? Hi. My name is George.
levar Oh, hell, no.
sheldon You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist.
howard Are we sure this is the place?
raj The doorman said this is the right building.
leonard I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman.
man Who is it?
leonard Uh, I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?
prof_sharpe Hold on. Can I help you?
leonard Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
howard We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
leonard Any chance you know what it is?
prof_sharpe Yes, he was always working on this.
raj I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
prof_sharpe It’s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That’s his food diary.
leonard Really?
prof_sharpe Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.
raj Does it work?
howard Seriously?
raj Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.
prof_sharpe Sorry it’s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.
leonard So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?
prof_sharpe To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.
raj You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.
raj Well, you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm.
bernadette I’m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.
penny No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.
bernadette I did say that, didn’t I?
penny Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.
bernadette Where? To Babies R Us?
penny You’re doing it again.
bernadette Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.
penny Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.
bernadette I think I’d rather go.
penny No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.
bernadette Thank you.
penny Even though your dress is ugly.
sheldon Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.
amy Take that, glass ceiling.
sheldon And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off, I’d, uh, I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night.
amy Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.
sheldon If you didn’t press record…
amy I pressed it.
leonard Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott.
raj And we still don’t know who framed him.
leonard I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
howard I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.
leonard That’s a nice way of looking at it.
howard Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I’m covered.
leonard You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.
howard I love that.
raj Yeah, me, too.
leonard Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face.
raj Oh, well, that’s the best part.
howard Oh, yeah.
bernadette Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?
dan Sure, go ahead.
bernadette Just want you to know I didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.
dan No, it’s okay.
bernadette No, it’s not. Penny told me that everyone’s scared of me.
dan What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?
penny What?
bernadette No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.
dan Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I’ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.
bernadette No problem. When does that start?
dan Five months ago.
bernadette What?
dan Yeah.
bernadette Who’s been paying for my coffee?
dan All of us.
penny Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
bernadette What else don’t I know about?
penny Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?
bernadette Yeah?
penny That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
bernadette You’re kidding.
dan No, no. It’s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she’s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.
bernadette I feel so bad.
penny Well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.
bernadette Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster.
dan But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.
bernadette No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person.
dan Come on, don’t cry. It’s okay.
bernadette It’s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?
penny Because this company needs you.
dan It’s fine. We don’t mind paying for the coffee.
bernadette I can’t let you do that.
dan Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.
bernadette I guess that would be all right.
penny See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.
bernadette You’re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
leonard How come you’re up so late?
sheldon I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
leonard Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
sheldon It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all.
leonard Sad?
sheldon Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
leonard Yeah. What did they say?
sheldon Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.
leonard Congratulations.
sheldon Let’s celebrate.
leonard Sheldon, that wasn’t for you.
sheldon Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.
sheldon LeVar Burton? LeVar Burton? LeVar Burton?
levar Ugh. What are you doing here?
sheldon You told me not to call, and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.
levar Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don’t know why I didn’t get a gate.
sheldon You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk
