howard It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
leonard Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.
sheldon Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts.
howard What?
sheldon It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all.
howard Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere.
leonard We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
sheldon I know, I was there.
howard Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights.
sheldon How late?
howard Well, I don’t know, midnight, one.
sheldon One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.
howard If you’re tired, have some coffee.
sheldon What? You have some coffee.
howard I am having coffee.
sheldon And look how irritable it’s making you!
leonard Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try
sheldon Fine. I don’t think I can go much longer.
leonard It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up.
sheldon I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
leonard Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.
penny Good morning.
leonard What is this?
amy Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.
leonard Oh, that is so nice.
sheldon Ow, it does hurt.
leonard So, what are you guys gonna do today?
amy Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening.
sheldon Oh, that was never happening.
penny Oh, I’ll go. I like a party.
amy Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.
penny It’s okay, I’ll still go.
leonard You don’t think you’ll be bored?
penny Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?
sheldon I won’t be there.
leonard Look at that, it is a party.
howard Sorry I have to work all weekend.
bernadette It’s okay.
howard Thanks again for breakfast.
raj Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.
bernadette You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
raj So, what should we do today?
bernadette Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me.
raj Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?
bernadette Not really.
raj Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.
bernadette I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas.
raj Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?
bernadette Isn’t it a little early for that?
raj You have to get to it eventually.
bernadette Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing.
raj How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
bernadette I don’t think you are.
raj You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.
voice Psst, hey, kid.
sheldon Huh, what?
the_flash You look tired. Why don’t you have an energy drink? Everyone’s doing it.
sheldon Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.
the_flash Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.
sheldon I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.
the_flash All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.
sheldon Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
the_flash You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.
sheldon I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
the_flash Here. It’s on the house.
sheldon The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?
the_flash You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.
amy Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.
penny Hi.
bert Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke.
amy Bert’s a geologist.
bert And a joker.
penny How early are we?
amy Oh, actually, we’re an hour late.
penny I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
bernadette I don’t even know where to begin.
raj Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.
bernadette Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here.
raj Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
bernadette Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
raj Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?
bernadette My dad built it for me.
raj Wow, it’s so cute.
bernadette This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.
raj Oh, and did they have kids?
bernadette They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.
raj Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all.
bernadette Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
raj I skipped spin class for this.
howard Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
leonard Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
sheldon Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.
leonard Are you okay?
sheldon Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.
howard You wanted him awake.
penny So should we talk to each other or mingle?
amy I don’t know where everyone is.
penny Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.
bert Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up.
amy Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.
penny Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
bert Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing.
penny Wait, what do you mean she’s her?
bert Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?
penny No.
amy No.
bert Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.
penny What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?
amy I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon.
bert Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you.
penny Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?
howard Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
leonard According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two.
sheldon My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.
howard Why don’t you just go home?
sheldon No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.
leonard What?
sheldon I want another one.
leonard So?
sheldon That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.
leonard You only had one.
sheldon No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.
howard You can’t develop a problem that fast.
sheldon You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling.
leonard We can’t afford to lose any more time.
howard Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?
leonard That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
sheldon I’m sorry. Yes, of course.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.
howard No worries.
sheldon You guys stink.
bernadette Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.
raj I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
bernadette Does it really need one?
raj Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?
bernadette Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.
raj Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.
bernadette Are you just gonna name all the colours?
raj Well, not now.
bernadette I don’t care what colour the room is.
raj Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you.
bernadette Well, you’re not, so just drop it. I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?
raj Sorry. Sorry.
bert And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.
penny You trend setter.
amy Just the right idea at the right time.
penny Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard.
bert Who?
penny Leonard Hofstadter.
bert Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.
penny That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down.
bert It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.
amy And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
penny You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.
amy Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart.
penny Wow, you popular girls are mean.
leonard I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?
sheldon Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?
leonard Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem.
sheldon I do.
leonard You don’t.
sheldon Yeah, but I do.
leonard No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?
sheldon With what?
leonard Your problem.
sheldon I thought I didn’t have a problem.
howard That was painful to watch.
raj So where are we going?
bernadette I don’t know.
raj Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
bernadette Raj, why don’t I care about anything?
raj I’m sorry?
bernadette It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?
raj Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.
bernadette I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?
raj Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.
bernadette Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.
raj Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story.
sheldon Leonard, can I ask you a question?
leonard Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
sheldon Howard, can I ask you a question?
howard No.
sheldon All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…
leonard Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care.
sheldon You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
leonard Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
sheldon I can’t.
leonard Yes, you can.
sheldon No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing.
leonard Seriously?
sheldon I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.
leonard It’s okay, we’ll figure something out.
sheldon But what if we can’t?
leonard It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy?
howard When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.
amy Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.
bert My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?
amy I think we’re good.
bert Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people.
penny Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.
bert You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.
penny Okay.
amy Bye.
raj Uh, pull over.
bernadette What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you.
raj Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.
dr_koothrapalli Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?
raj What? No.
dr_koothrapalli Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?
raj No.
dr_koothrapalli Great. What’s up?
raj This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
dr_koothrapalli Of course. What seems to be the trouble?
bernadette Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies.
dr_koothrapalli Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby.
bernadette But I thought I’d be more excited.
dr_koothrapalli Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.
bernadette Thank you. I feel better now.
raj Well I don’t.
dr_koothrapalli Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.
leonard Um, I don’t really know how to say this.
colonel_williams Well, you could try starting with sir.
leonard Right. Sorry, sir.
sheldon He said start with it, not end with it.
leonard Sir.
colonel_williams Hmm?
howard We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.
sheldon The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
leonard I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.
colonel_williams How long do you need?
howard We, we’re thinking, two years.
colonel_williams All right.
howard That’s it? You’re okay with that?
colonel_williams What, you think you’re the first government contractor who isn’t gonna deliver on time? We’re still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.
leonard Thanks for understanding, sir.
howard Yes, thank you so much.
sheldon We, we really appreciate it.
leonard All right, pressure’s off
howard Wanna see a movie?
sheldon Popcorn’s on me.
