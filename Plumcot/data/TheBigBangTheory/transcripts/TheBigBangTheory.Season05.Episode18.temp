leonard I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.
sheldon Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.
barber Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.
barber I’m sorry, Uncle Tony’s in the hospital. He’s pretty sick.
sheldon Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?
barber I can cut it for you.
sheldon You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?
leonard Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber.
sheldon He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.
leonard What are you talking about?
sheldon When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio.
leonard There’s no such thing as haircut records.
sheldon Yes, there are.
leonard Have you ever seen them?
sheldon No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?
barber Your what?
sheldon To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.
leonard Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
sheldon Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you.
barber So my kid said the funniest thing today.
sheldon Nope.
leonard When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.
sheldon Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
leonard Sure. What are you doing?
sheldon I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
leonard Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
sheldon Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
howard Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
raj Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
howard Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred.
raj But it says eight a.m.
howard You read it as oh eight hundred.
raj It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
howard You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy.
leonard So, what kind of things are they… will you stop that?
sheldon I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.
penny You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you.
sheldon Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…
leonard Sheldon, be nice.
sheldon I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.
raj You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
howard Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going
raj Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you.
amy I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.
sheldon I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it.
amy What about Supercuts?
sheldon I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
amy Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?
sheldon Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?
amy Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.
howard Hi.
bernadette Hi, sweetie.
howard I miss you.
bernadette I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.
howard Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.
bernadette Cool. How do they do that?
howard It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.
bernadette You threw up?
howard Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.
bernadette That sounds mean.
howard No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?
bernadette Sure, why?
howard I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.
sheldon Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.
nurse Can I help you?
sheldon Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
nurse Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?
sheldon Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut.
nurse I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
sheldon I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.
penny So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?
leonard Hmm.
penny Well, is it or isn’t it?
leonard You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.
penny Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy.
leonard Like I said, complicated game.
penny So did I win or not?
leonard Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Hey.
penny Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move.
sheldon Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?
penny Okay, what just happened?
leonard I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.
penny Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
sheldon No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.
penny Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand.
sheldon Leonard, explain it to her.
leonard Oh, uh, he’s crazy.
sheldon I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time.
leonard Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
penny You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen.
sheldon Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point.
leonard I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
sheldon You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.
leonard Great. What are you going to do first?
sheldon I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
leonard I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him.
penny If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.
howard Hi.
bernadette Howie, what happened to you?
howard We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.
bernadette Survival training? Is that like camping?
howard Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.
bernadette Do you sleep in tents?
howard No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.
bernadette Poor baby.
howard But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.
bernadette You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.
howard I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.
bernadette Are you crying?
howard No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.
bernadette Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you.
howard Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.
bernadette Well, is there anything I could do to help?
howard No. Wait. Send more underwear.
leonard Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
sheldon Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos.
leonard Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning.
sheldon Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
leonard I was sleeping.
sheldon Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
leonard No, he doesn’t.
sheldon Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
leonard Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
penny What the hell?!
leonard Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.
penny Why did you get bongos?
sheldon Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.
leonard Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
penny Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.
sheldon Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
leonard Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.
sheldon Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.
leonard W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
sheldon Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
penny Where are you going?
sheldon Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
bernadette Surprise.
howard What are you doing here?
bernadette I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.
howard Oh, I love you so much.
bernadette Oh, I love you.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, your bath is getting cold!
howard Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo.
amy He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
leonard Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
amy That was kind of uncalled for.
leonard No, it was called for.
sheldon What’s going on?
penny All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.
sheldon Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records.
penny All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once.
leonard I’m sorry, duh, what?
penny It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.
sheldon Amy, what do you think?
amy There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim.
sheldon Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
amy There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
leonard What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
sheldon Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.
penny Almost done.
sheldon At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.
penny Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes.
sheldon That’s okay, I never understood them anyway.
penny Okay, what do you think?
sheldon Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.
penny Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.
sheldon Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.
penny Okay. Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.
sgeldon Thank you very much.
penny You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move.
