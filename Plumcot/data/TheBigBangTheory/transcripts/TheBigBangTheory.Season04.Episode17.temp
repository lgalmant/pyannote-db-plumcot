sheldon Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?
leonard Okay, I’m out of here.
sheldon Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid. Where are you going?
leonard I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
sheldon But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.
leonard Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
sheldon We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.
leonard Just come with me to Raj’s.
sheldon Well, I don’t want to go to a party.
leonard It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.
sheldon I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.
leonard How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
sheldon Because we don’t throw parties.
leonard I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?
sheldon Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.
leonard I guess you’re right. See you later.
sheldon Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
leonard Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
sheldon I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
leonard I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
sheldon But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both.
leonard What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?
sheldon No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.
sheldon Oh, dear!
leonard What?
sheldon Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
leonard So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
sheldon And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style.
leonard Ugh!
sheldon The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?
leonard Right.
sheldon Is it about me or the dead pixels?
raj Hey, you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.
leonard Oh, sounds great.
sheldon Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.
priya Hey, you.
leonard Hi.
howard That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?
sheldon Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.
priya There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.
sheldon Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in.
leonard Just sit here.
sheldon Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone.
raj Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.
sheldon Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.
priya Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?
sheldon A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
penny Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?
sheldon Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
penny Where are all your friends?
sheldon Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.
penny Okay.
sheldon Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
penny Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What’s troubling you, buddy?
sheldon I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment.
penny Oh, the horror.
sheldon Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?
penny Ugh!
sheldon Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?
amy Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj’s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.
sheldon Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.
amy Wise.
penny There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
amy Hi, bestie.
penny Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
amy Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.
penny Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?
sheldon Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
penny Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.
amy Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.
penny Okay, I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya.
amy Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
sheldon Cluck-cluck-cluck.
amy Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.
sheldon Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
amy I’m not saying that you’re not fun. You’re the most fun person I know.
penny A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.
amy Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.
penny Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards.
amy So needy.
leonard What you doing?
sheldon I’m setting out snacks.
leonard You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
sheldon I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?
leonard You’re having people over?
sheldon Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton.
leonard Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
sheldon Possibly. I Tweeted him.
leonard Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.
sheldon Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.
leonard Of course. Good night.
sheldon Leonard.
leonard Yeah?
sheldon We had a good run, you and I.
leonard Okay.
sheldon But change is a part of life.
leonard It certainly is.
sheldon Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
leonard I am leaving.
sheldon Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard.
leonard Good-bye, Sheldon.
sheldon And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back.
leonard Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
sheldon Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?
stuart Um. Hi. I’m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I’m currently living in. And I guess what I’m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.
sheldon That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?
zack I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… uh… could you come back to me?
sheldon Of course. Barry?
barry I’m Barry Kwipke, and I’m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?
sheldon Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.
barry One more question…
sheldon Yes, you must be present to win.
zack Okay, I’m ready. I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… oh, crap, why is this so hard?
penny Oh, hey.
bernadette Hi.
amy Yo, P-dog.
penny What’s up?
bernadette We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
amy Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.
penny I kind of figured that.
amy Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.
penny No.
amy She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.
bernadette We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.
penny Oh. Gee, thanks, but I’m not really in the mood.
amy You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
penny Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?
amy Yes.
bernadette Sure.
penny All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.
amy If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.
zack Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There’s no one around, so naturally, I’m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.
sheldon Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
barry Weally? That’s your question?
zack What’s the difference?
sheldon Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
zack Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?
sheldon Surprisingly, yes.
zack Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?
stuart Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I’d like something to think about in the shower.
zack Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…
sheldon The water level rose.
zack No.
sheldon Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.
barry Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.
sheldon Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting.
barry Does yours have wet bweasts in it?
sheldon Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.
zack So, long story short, I nailed her.
sheldon When he finished, he shouted Eureka!
zack No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don’t know why. Just do.
sheldon All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun.
barry That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?
zack Great, I’ll make a beer run.
stuart And I’ll take a shower. We’ll meet back here in fifteen.
barry Check.
sheldon I’m unhappy.
leonard This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
priya When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.
leonard I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
priya Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn’t he?
howard Oh, please. That crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.
leonard Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.
howard Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?
priya Oh, God, you’re kidding.
raj Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”
leonard Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
raj I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
leonard Hear, hear.
howard Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?
priya Why is it called a toast?
leonard Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
raj Sheldon tells it better.
leonard He kind of does.
howard Yeah.
leonard Aw, hell, I miss him.
penny So, where do you guys want to go dancing?
bernadette We were hoping you’d know a place.
amy Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.
penny Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?
amy That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.
penny Okay, let’s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.
bernadette But you could if you wanted to, right?
penny Well, yeah, I guess.
bernadette Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?
penny More or less.
amy What’s that like?
penny I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.
bernadette I would take that deal all day long.
penny Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m totally okay with it.
amy You know, if being on your own is new to you, I’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I’ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?
penny Um, no.
amy You should get one.
bernadette What’s that?
amy It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
penny Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
bernadette Oh, God, that is so romantic.
penny Yeah, it was.
bernadette Leonard’s really one of a kind.
amy Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?
penny Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite.
amy Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.
bernadette That’s kind of creepy.
stuart Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?
sheldon No.
stuart Dibs.
priya I’m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?
leonard He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
raj I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
priya Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?
leonard Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
sheldon All my friends. All my friends. All my friends.
howard I think it’s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
raj Come on in.
sheldon Thank you.
leonard Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
sheldon I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
priya Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.
sheldon Thank you.
priya Would you like some homemade chili?
sheldon Are there beans in it?
priya Yes.
sheldon Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.
priya Sheldon, do you want some or not?
sheldon Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered.
raj I’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.
all Cheers.
sheldon Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?
priya Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
sheldon She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
levar_burton Hello? I… Oh, I don’t think so. I am so done with Twitter.
