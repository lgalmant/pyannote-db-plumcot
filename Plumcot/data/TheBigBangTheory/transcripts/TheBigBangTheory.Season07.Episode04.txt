sheldon_cooper So what’d you think?
amy_farrah_fowler It was good.
sheldon_cooper That’s it? Good”
amy_farrah_fowler I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.
sheldon_cooper My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites.
amy_farrah_fowler It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
sheldon_cooper Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it.
amy_farrah_fowler All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?
penny Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter You bought my mom’s book?
penny Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.
penny Oh, cool. Are there pictures?
leonard_hofstadter Seriously, please find another book.
penny Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?
leonard_hofstadter There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.
penny Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
leonard_hofstadter It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.
penny Oh, my God, you still go left.
raj_koothrappali Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
howard_wolowitz Halle Berry. Why?
raj_koothrappali Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.
howard_wolowitz Because her life wasn’t enough?
raj_koothrappali Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Aw!
howard_wolowitz Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Aw!
penny Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
leonard_hofstadter They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.
penny You were wearing her bra.
leonard_hofstadter That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
penny Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.
penny Well, why were you so angry?
leonard_hofstadter Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.
penny Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
leonard_hofstadter I do, too, but there’s not.
penny Really? Are you sure about that?
leonard_hofstadter Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it.
stuart_bloom Is make-up really necessary?
raj_koothrappali Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
stuart_bloom You got it.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.
stuart_bloom I don’t think I can give you that.
raj_koothrappali Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?
stuart_bloom Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?
raj_koothrappali Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?
stuart_bloom I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?
raj_koothrappali My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?
raj_koothrappali Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on.
stuart_bloom Really? Like what?
raj_koothrappali Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business.
stuart_bloom Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.
raj_koothrappali Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?
stuart_bloom I do have one oddly long testicle.
raj_koothrappali Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!
leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doin’?
sheldon_cooper Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works.
leonard_hofstadter So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
sheldon_cooper Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm. And?
sheldon_cooper And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
sheldon_cooper Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, buddy.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
sheldon_cooper Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?
leonard_hofstadter I gotta go.
leonard_hofstadter You ready to go?
penny Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.
leonard_hofstadter Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
penny Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…
leonard_hofstadter Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go.
penny Hey, what’s going on with you?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing, I’m fine.
penny All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?
leonard_hofstadter No. Not everything is about my mom.
penny ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go.
leonard_hofstadter Except this is totally about my mom.
penny I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
leonard_hofstadter That sounds nice. Yeah.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, you ready for lunch?
leonard_hofstadter One sec. Hey. Sorry.
howard_wolowitz Hi, Penny.
penny Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.
penny Okay.
howard_wolowitz Wow. Sex at work?
leonard_hofstadter Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.
howard_wolowitz Sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Who just had sex with me at work.
howard_wolowitz Damn. How’d you swing that?
leonard_hofstadter Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.
howard_wolowitz Seriously?
leonard_hofstadter Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.
howard_wolowitz You sound kind of proud of it.
leonard_hofstadter I am, I’m really proud.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Why?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.
sheldon_cooper April 13, a dark night, indeed.
amy_farrah_fowler So what can I do for you?
sheldon_cooper I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
sheldon_cooper Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.
amy_farrah_fowler That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
sheldon_cooper Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I’m in.
sheldon_cooper Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.
amy_farrah_fowler Good night, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?
bernadette_rostenkowski You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.
howard_wolowitz How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes.
howard_wolowitz That’s it? No compassion?
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.
howard_wolowitz Bernie…
bernadette_rostenkowski God, what is going on with you?
howard_wolowitz I’m sharing my pain.
bernadette_rostenkowski And I’m not buying it. Try again.
howard_wolowitz I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
bernadette_rostenkowski Strike two.
howard_wolowitz I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
howard_wolowitz I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes.
raj_koothrappali Three, two, one.
stuart_bloom That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.
raj_koothrappali Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!
stuart_bloom That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around.
raj_koothrappali Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight.
stuart_bloom If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now.
raj_koothrappali What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?
stuart_bloom Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no.
amy_farrah_fowler I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
sheldon_cooper Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
sheldon_cooper That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it.
sheldon_cooper Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.
amy_farrah_fowler I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you feel better?
sheldon_cooper Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I was just… what is happening?
penny Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, oh, I have. So bad.
penny And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Mom?
dr_beverly_hofstadter I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.
leonard_hofstadter I… uh…
penny Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.
dr_beverly_hofstadter When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t dream that?
dr_beverly_hofstadter How did that make you feel?
leonard_hofstadter Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now.
raj_koothrappali In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?
stuart_bloom Combined?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
stuart_bloom Zero.
raj_koothrappali Dude, this is, this is brutal.
stuart_bloom I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.
raj_koothrappali This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
stuart_bloom And make them look us in the eye.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, anything is better than this.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 Not interested.
raj_koothrappali I was wrong. This is worse.
howard_wolowitz Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.
sheldon_cooper That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
raj_koothrappali Like a hero.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Yeah!
leonard_hofstadter Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Aw!
