leonard Will you please turn your shirt off?
raj What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.
howard Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples.
leonard Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?
stuart Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
sheldon Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
stuart No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan’s doing him a favour.
sheldon Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
leonard Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
sheldon Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now.
raj Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee!
howard I’m sad to say I taught him those moves.
leonard I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass?
sheldon I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
howard That’s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
sheldon Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.
raj That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
sheldon What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
howard Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.
raj Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision.
sheldon There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
howard Why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
leonard He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
sheldon Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.
penny Hi!
leonard Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
penny Um, can you give me a hint?
leonard Stan Lee.
penny Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?
leonard No, no, Stan Lee.
penny Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!
leonard You have no idea who he is, do you?
penny Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
leonard Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?
penny Um, he was on Star Trek.
leonard Nope.
penny Star Wars?
leonard No.
penny Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
leonard That’s Bruce Lee.
penny Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother, Stan?
howard Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?
sheldon Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
howard But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?
sheldon I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.
howard You’ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
sheldon Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.
penny I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
sheldon It bothers me.
howard Sheldon, this is a summons.
sheldon A summons for what?
howard Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
sheldon November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.
penny No, it isn’t.
sheldon Yes, it is.
penny No, it isn’t.
sheldon Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
penny Mmm, no, it isn’t.
sheldon Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?
penny Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?
sheldon So you betrayed me?
penny No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
sheldon But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
penny Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.
leonard It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
sheldon I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
howard You are guilty. That one I liked.
sheldon I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.
penny Sheldon, I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
sheldon You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now.
howard Okay, he’s going to jail.
leonard Oh, that’s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.
sheldon Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee.
leonard Whoa! What do you mean all?
sheldon Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious.
leonard Yeah, okay. No.
sheldon Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
leonard That’s what I’m saying.
sheldon Howard?
howard Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie’s Choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. No.
sheldon Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you? All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness.
penny Oh, balls.
sheldon Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
sheldon Penny. Penny.
penny Penny.
sheldon That’s just wrong.
penny All right, let’s go.
sheldon Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress.
penny What is this?
sheldon I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?
penny Do I have a choice?
sheldon Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?
penny Darn tootin’, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.
sheldon Excellent. Go on.
penny The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in, like, ever.
sheldon And who performed that heroic act?
penny Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
sheldon There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.
penny But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
sheldon Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
penny But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally.
sheldon Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
judge Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?
sheldon Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.
judge I know what it means. I went to law school.
sheldon And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement.
judge The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.
sheldon Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.
judge Impressive.
sheldon Thank you.
judge Guilty. Pay the cashier.
sheldon I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
judge No, I’m following the law. I’m ignoring you.
sheldon Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.
judge Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I’m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.
sheldon I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
sheldon That’s my spot.
raj I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
leonard Oh, come on, why would you do that?
raj Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.
howard Okay, I’m cutting. I’m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.
leonard Hey.
penny Sheldon’s in jail.
leonard Sheldon’s in jail?
raj You called it.
leonard For what?
penny What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.
leonard So tell him to apologize.
penny Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail.
leonard Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye.
sheldon Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?
guard What?
sheldon I need to use the restroom.
guard Knock yourself out.
sheldon That’s the toilet?
guard Well, it ain’t a wishing well.
sheldon Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
leonard Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
howard Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
raj Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.
howard That’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.
raj Hey, I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.
penny We’re home.
leonard Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?
sheldon You know very well how it went.
leonard Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
sheldon I was found guilty and fined $533.
penny I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.
sheldon I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.
howard Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee.
leonard Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.
howard You’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.
sheldon You had gelato with Stan Lee?
howard He said we could call him Stan.
leonard Except for Raj.
sheldon Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.
penny Okay, I realize that…
sheldon Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.
penny Okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…
sheldon No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!
penny Did he just somehow give me the finger?
howard Not just the finger. The moving finger.
penny Hey, Stuart.
stuart Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.
penny What’s going on?
stuart Nothing. I’m just getting ready to close up and head out.
penny Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
stuart Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.
penny Oh, nice.
stuart Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn’t even show up.
penny Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.
stuart Sure, yeah, name it.
penny Well, I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.
stuart Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have his phone number.
penny Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
stuart Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.
penny Really? Great!
stuart But I can’t give it to you.
penny Then why did you tell me you had it?
stuart I don’t know. Just chatting. You’re looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.
penny I’m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.
stuart Mm-hmm. Wait.
penny Yeah?
stuart Maybe we can make a deal.
penny What kind of deal?
stuart I will give you the address if you go to my cousin’s wedding with me.
penny You’re extorting a date out of me?
stuart I kind of have to. The cousin who’s getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.
penny Can I bring Leonard?
stuart Sure. What the hell.
penny Deal.
stuart We’ll tell people he’s your cousin.
sheldon This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door.
penny Yup.
sheldon Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
penny Okay, sweetie, I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies.
