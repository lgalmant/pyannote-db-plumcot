sheldon Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?
howard Sure.
leonard Really?
howard Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.
sheldon There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…
leonard Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.
sheldon Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.
leonard That’s pretty cool, Sheldon.
sheldon Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.
raj Hey.
leonard Hey.
howard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
raj You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?
leonard Yeah.
raj Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.
leonard Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.
sheldon All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.
raj Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
sheldon Excellent.
howard Good for you.
leonard Congratulations.
raj And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
leonard Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
sheldon I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
howard Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.
sheldon Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
howard Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?
raj Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.
leonard My mommy raised a gentleman.
raj Hey. Thanks for coming by.
leonard Yeah. I’m excited to help.
raj I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.
leonard I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.
raj You should have told him to mind his own business.
leonard Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.
raj What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
leonard Mmm, they’re alpha males.
raj Huh, what does that make us?
leonard We could be betas. They’re second in charge.
raj Okay, that sounds good.
leonard Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
raj Okay, that sounds like us.
leonard Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?
raj I don’t know. How do you want to start?
leonard I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
raj No. We can do this by ourselves.
leonard Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
raj I don’t know. How do you want to start?
penny Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.
sheldon I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.
penny Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.
sheldon I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali.
penny Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.
sheldon How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.
penny No, no. It’s about my acting career.
sheldon Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list.
penny Well.
sheldon Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.
penny Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.
sheldon Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.
penny Well, why?
sheldon I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.
penny You’re really not gonna tell me?
sheldon No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.
bernadette What’s going on in here?
howard I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
bernadette Oh. How do you drink it?
howard Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.
bernadette I think I’ll have a beer.
howard First take a picture with me.
bernadette Why?
howard Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.
bernadette Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?
howard You betcha. The very one.
bernadette Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together.
howard I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.
bernadette Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.
howard With my honeybunch.
bernadette You’re being childish.
howard No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.
bernadette I’m sorry. What do we know?
howard In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.
bernadette Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?
howard You don’t think I’m a leader?
bernadette I was kidding. Of course you are.
howard Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.
bernadette You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?
howard All by myself.
bernadette There’s my big boss man.
sheldon So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.
penny Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.
sheldon Mmm.
penny If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?
sheldon Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
penny No.
sheldon All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.
penny Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
sheldon Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?
penny Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
sheldon No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.
penny I’m sorry. What was I thinking?
sheldon Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?
penny ‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it.
sheldon Ah, it’s just like he’s here.
raj Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.
leonard Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.
raj Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
leonard That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
raj Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.
leonard My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.
raj And he’s all white.
leonard They zip him up in that bag.
raj And Gertie can’t stop crying.
leonard The flower dies.
raj Okay, let’s talk about something else.
leonard All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.
raj And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
leonard It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.
raj Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.
leonard That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
raj Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
leonard Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
raj Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.
leonard The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
raj Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
leonard All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
raj We, we can totally do that.
leonard I know.
raj This is great.
leonard Yeah, you know what else it is?
raj What?
howard Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
raj Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.
sheldon It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.
howard Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?
sheldon You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.
leonard Hey.
howard Hello.
raj Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.
howard Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?
sheldon I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
leonard We want you back on the project with us.
sheldon Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?
raj Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help.
howard I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
raj It wasn’t, so are you in?
sheldon Certainly.
howard Sure.
leonard Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.
sheldon Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.
raj Okay, I think we should do it right now.
sheldon Tonight works better for me.
raj Okay.
penny Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? I’m starting to remember.
raj So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.
sheldon Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.
leonard How is that building on what he just said?
howard Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.
raj Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.
sheldon Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.
leonard Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant.
howard I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
sheldon Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out.
leonard It’s not Simon Says.
raj Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon.
sheldon You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?
girl Penny?
penny Oh, hey.
girl Hey. I haven’t seen you auditioning in a while.
penny Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.
girl You quit acting?
penny Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.
second_girl I heard you can make good money doing that.
penny Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.
first_girl Really?
penny Mmm.
first_girl ‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.
audiitoner Chelsea?
first_girl Wish me luck.
second_girl They’re gonna love you. I heard she’s pushing 40 and everything’s fake.
penny Yeah. I started that rumour.
leonard Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.
raj Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.
howard The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
sheldon Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.
leonard Squeeze yourself.
sheldon Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.
raj Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.
howard You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.
raj Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
sheldon Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.
raj Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.
howard It’s not always.
leonard What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.
sheldon We looked great.
leonard You let a guy sit on me.
howard He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.
leonard I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.
raj Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.
howard You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.
sheldon Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.
howard Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.
sheldon Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.
leonard Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
sheldon I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?
leonard Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge.
sheldon Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?
raj He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge.
sheldon No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?
penny I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.
amy I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
penny I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.
bernadette Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.
penny I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
bernadette Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard.
penny Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life.
bernadette You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.
penny Sure.
amy And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.
penny Okay.
bernadette How about now?
penny All right.
bernadette Don’t forget your wallet.
penny I, uh, huh.
sheldon Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it.
first_alien That soft pink alien looks delicious.
second_alien I could eat.
