sheldon_cooper Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I have pokh.
all@ Have it. Got it.
leonard_hofstadter Potl.
all@ Yup. Have it. Have it.
leonard_hofstadter Pukhpa.
all@ Have it. Got it. Yup.
howard_wolowitz I have Chorrr.
raj_koothrappali@sheldon_cooper Got it. Yup.
howard_wolowitz Nekhmakh.
raj_koothrappali@sheldon_cooper Yeah. Yeah.
howard_wolowitz And Kreplach.
raj_koothrappali Hold on a second. Kreplach?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
raj_koothrappali That isn’t Klingon, it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.
howard_wolowitz Well, as it turns out, it’s also a Klingon word.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Define it.
howard_wolowitz Kreplach, A hearty Klingon… dumpling.
raj_koothrappali Judge’s ruling?
sheldon_cooper Bilurrrbe.
penny Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
sheldon_cooper What’s wrong with your TV?
penny I don’t know, it just died, I’m getting a bunch of static.
howard_wolowitz Did you pay your cable bill?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…
leonard_hofstadter No,no, don’t tell her.
sheldon_cooper …playing Klingon Boggle.
leonard_hofstadter Aw!
howard_wolowitz What do you mean, aw? Like she didn’t know we were nerds?
sheldon_cooper All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.
penny Fine.
sheldon_cooper All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!
howard_wolowitz Look at those women.
leonard_hofstadter They’re gorgeous.
sheldon_cooper Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun.
howard_wolowitz Oh, look, the’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
sheldon_cooper Is qochbe’ spelled with a or a ?
howard_wolowitz Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
penny Oh. That’s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.
howard_wolowitz House? What house?
penny They all live in a house together.
howard_wolowitz A house, where?
penny I don’t know. Somewhere in L.A.
howard_wolowitz Wait a minute, you’re telling me that I’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?
penny Yeah, I guess.
howard_wolowitz And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, wh-where are you going?
penny To pay my cable bill.
sheldon_cooper All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?
leonard_hofstadter Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
raj_koothrappali Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
howard_wolowitz Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, the food’s here.
raj_koothrappali There’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
raj_koothrappali Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
howard_wolowitz Isn’t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.
sheldon_cooper Is my hamburger medium well?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Dill slices, not sweet?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Individual relish packets?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Onion rings?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Extra breading?
leonard_hofstadter I asked.
sheldon_cooper What did they say?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Did you protest?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Vociferously?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Well, then what took you so long?
leonard_hofstadter Just eat.
penny Hey, guys, what’d I miss? What’d I miss?
howard_wolowitz Giselle’s hanging by a thread.
penny Oh, good, I hate her.
howard_wolowitz Then you’re not invited to our wedding.
leonard_hofstadter Here you go.
penny Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
all@ Yes.
sheldon_cooper You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
leonard_hofstadter Put it on the agenda.
sheldon_cooper But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
penny Oh, Giselle’s not getting kicked off. It’s totally going to be Summer. What?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!
penny It’s one onion ring.
howard_wolowitz Just put it back before he comes!
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, I don’t think that’s where it was.
howard_wolowitz Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
sheldon_cooper Who touched my…
all@ Penny! Penny did it.
sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
penny I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?
sheldon_cooper The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
penny All right. Look, I didn’t know, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m sorry, but that is your second strike.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.
penny A sports metaphor?
sheldon_cooper Yes, baseball.
penny All right, yeah, I’ll play along. What was my first strike?
sheldon_cooper March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
penny I did?
sheldon_cooper The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
penny Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats.
sheldon_cooper I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
howard_wolowitz You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.
penny Come on, I touched one onion ring.
sheldon_cooper And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.
penny Oh, honey, the buses don’t go where you live, do they?
sheldon_cooper Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.
leonard_hofstadter Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.
howard_wolowitz One of us, one of us.
penny Well, what a thrill.
sheldon_cooper You’re sitting in my spot.
penny Oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, she’s in my spot.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.
penny I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.
sheldon_cooper All right, that’s it. Strike three.
penny Ooh, strike three.
penny I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
leonard_hofstadter Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.
penny Yeah, you do that.
leonard_hofstadter Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!
howard_wolowitz So based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.
raj_koothrappali Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.
howard_wolowitz When we find it, you want to go with us?
leonard_hofstadter To do what?
raj_koothrappali Party with the pretty girls, dude!
leonard_hofstadter Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place.
howard_wolowitz That’s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
sheldon_cooper No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.
howard_wolowitz Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America’s top models.
raj_koothrappali And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
penny Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
penny Oh, I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
sheldon_cooper Why?
penny Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don’t like your attitude.
sheldon_cooper You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.
penny Yeah, no, there’s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Look, here’s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
penny Really? Well, that’s great.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?
penny What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say.
penny Leonard, don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.
penny Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do.
leonard_hofstadter Well, actually, technically, you did do it.
penny That’s strike one, Leonard.
penny There you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Go ahead, eat it. I dare you
howard_wolowitz That’s it. There’s the house, I found America’s top models!
raj_koothrappali Are you sure?
howard_wolowitz Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.
leonard_hofstadter You can recognize people on Google Earth?
howard_wolowitz Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.
leonard_hofstadter NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?
howard_wolowitz It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.
penny Okay, where is he?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
penny Here. Try and go online.
leonard_hofstadter Problem with the WiFi?
penny No, just try.
sheldon_cooper Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.
penny Well?
leonard_hofstadter I reiterate, knuckle under.
penny No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Penny, you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
penny I don’t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
howard_wolowitz No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.
leonard_hofstadter There, see? Problem solved.
howard_wolowitz Voila!
sheldon_cooper Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks a lot, Howard.
howard_wolowitz What are you complaining about? I’m the one who has to take the class again.
sheldon_cooper Oh! Hello.
penny Time to do your laundry, huh?
sheldon_cooper It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
penny I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.
sheldon_cooper What are you implying?
penny I’m implying that you’re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant. Knuckle under, my ass.
penny Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?
sheldon_cooper No problem, I’ll just do my laundry another night.
penny Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
sheldon_cooper Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
penny Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.
penny Sheldon Sheldon Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Yes?
penny Where are my clothes?
sheldon_cooper Your clothes?
penny Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.
sheldon_cooper Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
penny Sheldon, where are my clothes?
sheldon_cooper You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?
penny How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
sheldon_cooper When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!
penny Get them down.
sheldon_cooper Apologize.
penny Never.
sheldon_cooper Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.
penny Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I’ve done some stupid things, you’ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
sheldon_cooper I’ve done no stupid things.
penny Look, you’ve got to meet me halfway here.
sheldon_cooper I am meeting you halfway, I’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
penny Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it’s junior rodeo on.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?
sheldon_cooper I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.
leonard_hofstadter A-a-a-aw!
sheldon_cooper Mwah-ha-ha.
penny Telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?
leonard_hofstadter No. Look, this has to stop.
penny Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
leonard_hofstadter All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here.
penny What’s this?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s Kryptonite.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter He can never know that I gave that to you.
penny Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?
leonard_hofstadter It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
raj_koothrappali Oh, pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.
howard_wolowitz God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy.
howard_wolowitz You know what? If it’s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I’m creepy.
leonard_hofstadter Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I’ll get him. Sheldon, it’s for you.
sheldon_cooper Who is it?
leonard_hofstadter Your mother.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
sheldon_cooper Penny,Penny,Penny… I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here’s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.
penny Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Yes?
sheldon_cooper Well played.
penny Thank you.
penny Understood.
model Can I help you
howard_wolowitz Yes, we here to fix the cable.
model I think we have satellite.
howard_wolowitz That’s what I meant.
model Oh. Okay, come on in.
howard_wolowitz She’s taller than all the women in my family combined.
raj_koothrappali What do we do now?
howard_wolowitz Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
