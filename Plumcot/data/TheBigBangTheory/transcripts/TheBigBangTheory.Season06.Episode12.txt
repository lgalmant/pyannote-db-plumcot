sheldon_cooper Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
sheldon_cooper No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I’ve never felt so alive. Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings.
leonard_hofstadter What recordings?
sheldon_cooper Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it’s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.
alex_jensen Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
alex_jensen Oh, I know, I’m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?
leonard_hofstadter Well, most of Saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. How about you?
alex_jensen Oh, I’m gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.
leonard_hofstadter Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.
alex_jensen Well, if you want, you can come with me.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, I’d love to, but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny.
alex_jensen Well, bring her.
leonard_hofstadter Well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff.
alex_jensen Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Jenga, I win!
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, that can’t be true.
raj_koothrappali I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig’em the Frog, Cap’n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.
leonard_hofstadter Are we done with this?
raj_koothrappali Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific. Something weird happened and I don’t know what to do about it.
howard_wolowitz What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.
raj_koothrappali How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.
leonard_hofstadter Working it? You can’t even talk to her.
raj_koothrappali I talk with my eyes.
howard_wolowitz You look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.
leonard_hofstadter She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God. You’re loving this.
leonard_hofstadter To my bones. I mean, I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.
raj_koothrappali I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
sheldon_cooper Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?
raj_koothrappali Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t steal anyone.
raj_koothrappali Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s not acceptable. I mean, I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.
leonard_hofstadter I’m androgynous?
sheldon_cooper Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.
leonard_hofstadter What do you guys think I should do?
raj_koothrappali I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
sheldon_cooper I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I’ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies.
penny What is happening?
sheldon_cooper I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I’ll be changing their names.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s involved?
sheldon_cooper Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let’s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.
penny You’re talking about Leonard.
sheldon_cooper No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s your assistant Alex, isn’t it?
sheldon_cooper No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
penny Wait, what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?
sheldon_cooper No, uh, no, I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?
penny Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
sheldon_cooper Okay, look, it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things.
penny I’m gonna kill her.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.
amy_farrah_fowler She’s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.
sheldon_cooper Ladies, ladies, please. We’re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We’re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat’s out of the bag. Let me explain what’s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.
penny We know what’s going on, Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper Well, what should I do?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, Alex is your employee. If she’s doing something that’s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. No, he’s loving it. Yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six.
penny What? He’s loving it?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.
sheldon_cooper Talk to her? That’s all you’ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.
sheldon_cooper Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?
alex_jensen I think it’s pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here’s something at four o’clock. Give Alex a talking to?
sheldon_cooper Well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?
alex_jensen Is there a problem?
sheldon_cooper Let’s not call it a problem. Let’s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.
alex_jensen What did I do?
sheldon_cooper You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.
alex_jensen What? I didn’t make a sexual advance on anybody.
sheldon_cooper Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.
alex_jensen What?
sheldon_cooper Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
alex_jensen This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.
alex_jensen I have to go.
sheldon_cooper So does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, pretty lady.
penny Oh, you seem extra happy.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I guess I am.
penny Any particular reason why?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.
penny Mm-hmm. Anything else?
leonard_hofstadter Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
penny That’s great.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. It. Was.
penny Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
penny Oh, and who’s that?
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
penny Oh, I just didn’t know if you meant me or Alex.
leonard_hofstadter Um, why would I mean Alex?
penny Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
leonard_hofstadter I’m missing something. Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you do that?
sheldon_cooper I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.
leonard_hofstadter At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
sheldon_cooper Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, what did you do?
sheldon_cooper Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I’m a delight.
sheldon_cooper Human Resources Department. Human Resources Department. Human Resources Department.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Come in.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.
sheldon_cooper So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
sheldon_cooper Like what?
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don’t even know what that means, but I’m gonna go ahead and tell you you can’t say it.
sheldon_cooper Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 I’m a what?
sheldon_cooper Well, y-you, I-I’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Whuh-ah! Woah! You can’t talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I’m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.
sheldon_cooper I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Hofstadter… Wolowitz… and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?
sheldon_cooper Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I’m sorry Alex hit on me, I’d no idea I’m cute.
penny Oh, damn it, you are.
leonard_hofstadter Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
penny I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?
leonard_hofstadter Of course not. No. Why?
penny Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.
leonard_hofstadter You do that?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship.
penny Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?
leonard_hofstadter No, I’m not happy.
penny Why are you smiling?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.
penny Well, I do.
leonard_hofstadter Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
penny Good.
leonard_hofstadter Come here. Tell you a secret?
penny What’s that?
leonard_hofstadter With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.
penny Can I tell you a secret?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
penny Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we’re all gonna stop.
leonard_hofstadter Message received. Ah, excuse me. Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That’s weird. I’m getting called in to Human Resources.
penny What did you do?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
howard_wolowitz Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
raj_koothrappali Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.
howard_wolowitz Do you really think you should be drinking right now?
raj_koothrappali How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Seek professional help?
raj_koothrappali I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
howard_wolowitz Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
howard_wolowitz Oh.
raj_koothrappali I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
howard_wolowitz Relax. Everything’s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.
raj_koothrappali Well, this is all your fault.
leonard_hofstadter How is this my fault?
raj_koothrappali If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening.
leonard_hofstadter I wasn’t screwing around with anyone.
raj_koothrappali Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
hr_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it’s been a while.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?
janine_davis Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn’t do anything.
janine_davis Is that alcohol on your breath?
raj_koothrappali Howard built a sex robot.
howard_wolowitz That is not true. All I did was build a robot.
janine_davis Did it have six breasts?
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, I’m a feminist, I don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has.
sheldon_cooper Well, hello.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
janine_davis And I’m a little busy right now.
sheldon_cooper But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
janine_davis And who was that?
sheldon_cooper You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.
janine_davis That’s it. All of you, in my office now!
sheldon_cooper And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don’t have to.
sheldon_cooper It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.
alex_jensen Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future.
alex_jensen Okay.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad.
penny So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, would you stop worrying about that?
penny I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.
leonard_hofstadter That’s great.
penny No, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don’t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.
leonard_hofstadter Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.
penny I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, come with me.
penny Where are we going?
leonard_hofstadter To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.
