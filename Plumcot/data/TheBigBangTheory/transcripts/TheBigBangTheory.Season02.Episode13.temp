raj Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.
sheldon First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…
howard Hey, I’m thinking of growing a mustache.
leonard Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
sheldon It is extracted from the plant…
howard I’m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!
raj Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
howard Oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.
leonard Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.
howard Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…
sheldon Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
raj Feel better now?
sheldon It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!
kripke Hey Hofstadter!
leonard Hey Kripke.
kripke Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!
howard What a jerk.
raj Don’t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.
howard Even twenty thousand of ’em.
leonard Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore.
howard C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke.
raj Yeah, he’s a ginormous knob.
howard That’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.
raj Fo’ shizzle.
sheldon Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.
leonard Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
sheldon Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!
kripke Yeah?
sheldon What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
kripke I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.
sheldon Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?
kripke Yeah, I’ll do that.
sheldon Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
leonard There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
penny Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
leonard Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line.
sheldon Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I’m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I’m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.
penny What’s up with Ichabod?
leonard Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
penny Oh really? Well, good for him.
leonard Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
penny Well, how did you guys become friends?
leonard There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
penny And you moved in anyway?
leonard I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
penny Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
leonard I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.
penny Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?
leonard I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
penny Oh come on, really?
sheldon First warning.
sheldon Penny Penny Penny.This is for you.
penny Hello Sheldon.
sheldon Hi.
penny What is this?
sheldon It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.
penny Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
sheldon Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.
penny Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
sheldon I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.
penny Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
sheldon Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.
penny Thanks pal.
sheldon You got it, buddy.
penny Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don’t know, pleasant?
sheldon Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
sheldon Your questionnaire, very disappointing.
leonard I answered every question Sheldon.
sheldon You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
leonard Aw, you picked up on that huh?
sheldon How could I not?
leonard Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?
leonard Hold on. I put some real work into that!
sheldon Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.
leonard It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
sheldon What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
leonard Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
sheldon I don’t see how you could.
leonard What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
sheldon What do you mean!?
leonard Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
sheldon I did learn how to swim.
leonard On the floor.
sheldon The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
leonard Then why learn how to swim?
sheldon The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists.
leonard No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
sheldon That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
leonard Where are we going?
sheldon You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
leonard Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
sheldon Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
woman_in_queue Thank you.
sheldon Family or friend?
woman Family.
sheldon Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill the void. It’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls.
leonard Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel.
sheldon Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
bookstore_employee Um, yeah but they’re all for little kids.
sheldon I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
employee Uh, I guess. They’re right over there by the wooden train set.
sheldon Oh! I love trains!
employee I bet you do.
sheldon Oh my! That’s awfully sticky. Alright, let’s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It’s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?
little_girl I don’t like birds, they scare me.
sheldon Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
girl Curious George.
sheldon Oh I do like monkeys!
girl Curious George is a monkey.
sheldon Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?
girl Okay.
leonard Sheldon, what are you doing?
sheldon I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
girl Rebecca.
sheldon Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon.
leonard No you’re not, let’s go.
sheldon We were really hitting it off.
leonard Don’t look up, there’s cameras.
raj I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?
leonard_and_howard Lysine.
raj Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
sheldon Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
leonard Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!
howard Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.
sheldon See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.
raj Stu the cockatoo?
leonard Yes, he’s new at the zoo.
sheldon It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
howard Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
sheldon Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because I hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don’t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I’m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.
leonard Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop.
howard I can fix it.
sheldon Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that.
howard Gee. Why can’t Sheldon make friends?
sheldon Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.
sheldon You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.
kripke Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.
sheldon This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.
kripke You afwaid of heights, Cooper?
sheldon Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?
kripke Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.
sheldon Little kid Hominids, perhaps. Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
kripke Let’s go, Cooper.
sheldon Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.
kripke Hey, look at you, Cooper. You’re almost halfway to the top.
sheldon I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
sheldon Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
kripke Are you saying you’re stuck?
sheldon What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
kripke Understood all that. I’m not a mowon. Just keep going.
sheldon Yeah, I don’t think I can.
kripke Well, then. Cwimb back down.
sheldon No, that doesn’t seem any more likely.
kripke So what’s the pwan, Cooper?
sheldon Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out.
leonard I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
howard Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and…
leonard It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
sheldon Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.
together Oh…
kripke Hewo to you, too.
leonard How was rock climbing?
kripke He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
sheldon D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
kripke Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?
howard How much time you got?
leonard Want some Chinese food?
kripke Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?
leonard In the bathroom.
kripke Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I’m gonna eat Chinese.
penny Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.
leonard What’s that?
sheldon Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go.
howard Me, me. Let it be me.
sheldon Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.
leonard Can I whistle?
sheldon Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.
howard Guilty as charged. I’m out.
sheldon No. You, too, are safe.
howard Oh come on. What do I have to do?
penny Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…
sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?
leonard He had Lysine but changed it.
sheldon Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.
kripke I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.
penny Eww.
kripke Hewo. How did I walk past you? I’m Bawy.
penny Penny.
kripke Yeah, it’s not a vewy hot name. I’m gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.
howard Suddenly I’m looking pretty good, huh?
sheldon So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.
kripke No.
sheldon No? But we’re friends!
kripke I’m sowy. No, my fwiend?
sheldon I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
kripke No, that’s wong. There’s an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
sheldon Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys.
howard You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
leonard I didn’t think he had it in him.
raj He almost made it to the top this time.
