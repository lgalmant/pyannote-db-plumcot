sheldon Hold.
raj What?
sheldon Explain your sneeze.
raj I’m sorry?
sheldon Do you have allergies?
raj No.
sheldon Is there too much pepper on your salad?
raj I don’t put pepper on salads.
sheldon I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
raj Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself.
sheldon That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.
raj Guys, help me.
howard Sheldon, come on.
leonard Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. You’re on your own.
howard See you, buddy.
sheldon Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
leonard When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
sheldon Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.
howard Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
sheldon Sarcasm?
howard Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.
sheldon For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
raj The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
sheldon Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university.
leonard Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
sheldon I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto.
leonard Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
sheldon My room, of course.
raj Holy crap! Holy crap!
howard Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.
sheldon Go ahead.
howard A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
sheldon A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
howard So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
sheldon Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
leonard Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
sheldon Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?
raj When can I sit with you again?
sheldon When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
leonard I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
raj I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
howard Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where’s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
penny What? What are you doing with, what?
sheldon The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
penny Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
sheldon I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
penny Oh. What?
sheldon I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
penny Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?
sheldon Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
penny Oh, no, no, no, no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah, let’s go with puzzled.
sheldon A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.
penny Female jibber jabber?
sheldon Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.
penny Oh, they’re not my friends.
sheldon I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
leonard She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
sheldon Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.
leonard Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.
elizabeth Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I’d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn’t confuse it with what I’d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I’d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.
sheldon Hello.
elizabeth Nice to finally meet you in person.
sheldon I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard, I live
sheldon I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
elizabeth No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I’m sorry, I’m rambling. Hi-lo.
leonard Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
sheldon No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
elizabeth Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I’d pick the yogurt.
sheldon Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
leonard Look, it’s you.
elizabeth Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.
leonard Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys.
elizabeth I’m so glad you understand.
sheldon No, he doesn’t understand. I understand.
leonard Well, I understand, too.
sheldon You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
leonard Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
sheldon From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
elizabeth All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.
leonard Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart.
sheldon Get it together, man.
sheldon All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.
elizabeth Good to know.
elizabeth What if there’s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
sheldon Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?
elizabeth Can I ask a question about your roommate?
sheldon He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?
elizabeth What’s his relationship status?
sheldon Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.
elizabeth Okay.
sheldon Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
elizabeth How thoughtful.
sheldon Sleep well, my friend.
elizabeth You, too.
sheldon Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck.
leonard Yes?
elizabeth I saw your light on.
leonard Is everything all right?
elizabeth Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
leonard Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you.
elizabeth I thought you already read it.
leonard I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
elizabeth Aw, you’re smart.
leonard Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across.
elizabeth What chapter are you on?
leonard Uh, six.
elizabeth Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?
leonard Sure.
elizabeth I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
leonard Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way.
elizabeth Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble’s constant.
leonard Wow. You really make science come alive.
sheldon Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
leonard Morning, Sheldon.
sheldon Morning.
elizabeth Morning, Sheldon.
sheldon Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
elizabeth More than pleasant.
sheldon Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself.
leonard How do you take your coffee?
elizabeth Black.
leonard Okeydoke.
sheldon Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.
leonard Something his mother taught him.
sheldon All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.
elizabeth That’s very thoughtful, but I think I’ll finish my coffee first.
sheldon Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
penny Oh, good, you’re up. Look, my car won’t start. I need a ride to work.
sheldon Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
penny No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
sheldon Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
leonard Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.
penny Hello.
elizabeth Hi.
penny Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
elizabeth Nice to meet you.
penny Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?
elizabeth Yes, very much.
penny Good.
sheldon Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.
elizabeth Excuse me.
leonard Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car.
penny Hang on.
leonard Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
penny We just broke up.
leonard What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?
penny Not as good as you apparently.
leonard I, um, I don’t follow.
penny You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.
leonard Well, now…
sheldon Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
penny I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened.
sheldon That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.
leonard Well…
sheldon No.
leonard Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
sheldon The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
penny You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work.
leonard Penny, I can still drive you.
penny Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
sheldon I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal.
leonard I didn’t betray Penny.
sheldon Not Penny, me!
leonard How am I betraying you?
sheldon Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!
leonard Yeah, I guess I did.
howard What the hell are you doing?
raj Relax, it’s Nyquil.
leonard You still have a cold?
raj Maybe, but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.
leonard Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night.
raj Did you get a cold, too?
leonard No, but I was awake all night.
howard If you want, I can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills.
raj She won’t notice they’re missing?
howard She doesn’t know she takes them.
leonard No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues.
raj Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
leonard No.
howard Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
leonard No.
howard ‘Cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.
leonard Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.
raj Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
howard How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
raj It is if you love her and give her a name.
sheldon Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
raj Hi.
sheldon And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
howard Hi.
raj I’m a big fan of your work.
elizabeth Thank you.
sheldon And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard Hey, you.
elizabeth Hey, you.
leonard Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
elizabeth You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
leonard Sure. Black, right?
elizabeth Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.
leonard Coming right up.
raj What?
howard What do you mean what? It’s Halo night.
raj I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
howard That’s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom’s chicken soup.
raj I’m not hungry.
elizabeth Don’t send him away. Let him in.
howard Who’s that
raj I bought a parrot.
howard Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?
elizabeth Hi. Howard, right?
howard Uh, yeah.
elizabeth Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?
howard Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master.
elizabeth Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don’t have enough money to pay you. So we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.
howard Beg pardon?
elizabeth You two figure out the details, I’m going to go change into something I don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.
howard What the frak?
raj Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.
howard We broke up weeks ago.
raj Why didn’t you say anything?
howard I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
leonard Hey, who’s ready for Halo?
raj Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
howard He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
leonard I don’t understand.
elizabeth Oh, good. Leonard’s here.
raj Good?
leonard Elizabeth? What’s going on?
elizabeth What’s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don’t have enough money to pay any of you.
leonard Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
howard Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
raj Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this?
leonard We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
howard I’m out.
elizabeth Everybody ready?
raj Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.
