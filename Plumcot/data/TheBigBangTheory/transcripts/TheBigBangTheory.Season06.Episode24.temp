raj So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.
leonard Oh, that sounds romantic.
raj It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
leonard So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
raj I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.
sheldon Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.
leonard How’s that been working for you?
sheldon Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.
howard Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.
leonard I have a job.
sheldon Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.
howard No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.
leonard Well, do you really think I have a shot?
howard Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.
leonard He knows, wow.
sheldon Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
raj Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.
sheldon No one asked you, Uhura.
sheldon Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
leonard What do you think?
sheldon Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
leonard Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
sheldon Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting.
leonard I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
sheldon I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?
leonard Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.
sheldon Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?
raj If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.
lucy Wow. Your friend was actually up there?
raj Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
lucy Did he take the T-shirt to space?
raj Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?
lucy I don’t know. How many are there?
raj Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.
lucy Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?
raj Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?
lucy Will you be there?
raj Of course.
lucy Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.
penny So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.
leonard Oh, that’s awful.
penny Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
leonard So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?
penny I thought I said that to you.
leonard Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.
penny Wow, Hawking. Good for you.
leonard Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.
penny Well, how long?
leonard Three, four months.
penny Whoa. When would you leave?
leonard Couple of weeks.
penny Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.
leonard That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.
penny On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
leonard Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.
penny Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.
leonard Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up.
penny Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.
leonard Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
penny Okay. Good.
leonard I do have to ask you one favour.
penny Sure.
leonard Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.
penny Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?
leonard Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.
leonard Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.
howard Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?
amy Hello, Rajesh.
howard Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent.
leonard There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal.
sheldon Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.
penny Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.
bernadette You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.
penny Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.
raj Okay. I have a request to make.
amy And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.
raj The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
sheldon Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy.
raj Actually, I was thinking Leonard.
leonard Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured.
howard What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
raj You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
penny You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.
raj Good idea. Bernadette?
penny What the hell?
raj Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.
penny Oh, yeah.
bernadette Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?
howard Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary.
amy It should be me.
raj Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
amy A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.
sheldon Fine, I’ll do it.
amy So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me.
lucy That’s really nice to hear.
amy Maybe next week, we could all get together.
raj Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.
amy Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
raj What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
amy Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!
raj Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.
lucy I think I have to go to the bathroom.
raj We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.
sheldon This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section.
penny Yeah, it does, and here we are.
sheldon You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.
penny Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him.
sheldon Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches.
penny Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.
sheldon It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.
penny Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
sheldon I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
penny Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.
sheldon It was you.
penny It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
sheldon You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
penny I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do.
sheldon They lie so they don’t look petty.
penny Yeah.
sheldon How?
penny Like this. I am so happy for you.
sheldon Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
raj Hey.
lucy Hi.
raj I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?
lucy Amy wasn’t the problem.
raj Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.
lucy Thank you.
raj You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.
lucy A party?
raj A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there.
lucy I’m not sure.
raj Oh, please?
lucy Raj.
raj Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it.
lucy Okay.
raj Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me.
bernadette So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?
leonard Yeah.
bernadette Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
leonard Yeah.
howard I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.
leonard I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.
howard Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
leonard It’s not a competition.
howard You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water.
amy Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.
raj She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?
sheldon Um, can I have your attention, everyone? That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.
leonard Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.
sheldon Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.
howard Cheers.
penny Cheers.
howard It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
sheldon Thank you.
howard It must’ve killed you when I went to space.
raj Oh, no.
howard Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.
bernadette What’s going on?
raj Uh, go ahead. Read it.
howard Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.
raj Excuse me.
penny Raj, I’m so sorry.
amy Me, too.
sheldon It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
penny Well, here we are.
leonard Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.
penny I’m gonna miss you, too.
sheldon Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.
penny Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…
leonard Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.
sheldon All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you.
leonard Would you just relax?
sheldon Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.
penny Did you bring enough inhalers?
leonard Yeah.
penny And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World.
leonard I’m covered.
penny Okay.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made.
leonard Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.
penny Oh, Leonard.
sheldon It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.
penny I love you.
leonard I love you, too.
sheldon Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs.
penny Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?
raj Hang on.
penny Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.
raj That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.
penny Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?
raj No.
penny Oh. I’m so sorry.
raj No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.
penny Oh, Raj.
raj Penny, I, I miss her already.
penny I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.
raj What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?
penny You will.
raj No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable.
penny That’s just the booze talking.
raj No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.
penny You’re talking to me.
raj I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!
penny Oh, me, too.
raj So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.
penny That’s great. Do you want some wine?
raj Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…
amy Does he ever shut up?
raj … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….
