sheldon_cooper Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
amy_farrah_fowler And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
sheldon_cooper And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags.
sheldon_cooper Hit it.
howard_wolowitz For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
raj_koothrappali What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 Fun with flags, fun with flags.
howard_wolowitz Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 Fun with flags.
amy_farrah_fowler As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.
sheldon_cooper Who haven’t learned their place yet.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
sheldon_cooper Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.
amy_farrah_fowler So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.
sheldon_cooper So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…
penny I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?
leonard_hofstadter It’s cute, they’re having fun living together.
penny Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.
bernadette_rostenkowski Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.
leonard_hofstadter So, she’s just been lying to him?
penny Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.
sheldon_cooper Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
howard_wolowitz Oh, right.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.
howard_wolowitz Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny.
raj_koothrappali We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone.
sheldon_cooper So?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
sheldon_cooper I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
amy_farrah_fowler Anyway, how about dinner?
sheldon_cooper You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.
amy_farrah_fowler Thanks, but you don’t have to.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.
amy_farrah_fowler Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?
sheldon_cooper Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?
amy_farrah_fowler No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?
sheldon_cooper I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.
howard_wolowitz I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.
leonard_hofstadter So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
raj_koothrappali If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?
leonard_hofstadter You’re awful quiet, everything okay?
sheldon_cooper I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?
sheldon_cooper Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.
leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
sheldon_cooper Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
howard_wolowitz You heard him, guys, don’t ask.
sheldon_cooper Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand.
leonard_hofstadter She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
sheldon_cooper So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
raj_koothrappali Oh my God, that’s who you look like.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.
raj_koothrappali Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
howard_wolowitz And how single are you right now?
raj_koothrappali Eating cake on the toilet single.
sheldon_cooper Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.
howard_wolowitz Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
howard_wolowitz So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Well, of course not.
howard_wolowitz So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, no.
howard_wolowitz I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me?
howard_wolowitz See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.
leonard_hofstadter Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.
sheldon_cooper Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
leonard_hofstadter I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month.
sheldon_cooper It’s khoo-vakh.
leonard_hofstadter Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
sheldon_cooper No, no, he’s over there.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, there he is.
penny So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?
amy_farrah_fowler Um, it was a drywall problem.
penny Oh, no, what happened?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…
penny Wet wall?
amy_farrah_fowler Or damp wall, just as bad.
penny Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…
penny Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.
amy_farrah_fowler I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.
penny But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.
penny Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.
amy_farrah_fowler Thanks.
penny The woman at the wall store?
amy_farrah_fowler Let it go.
sheldon_cooper Are you going to confront Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, I’m going blind.
penny Hi.
amy_farrah_fowler Food’s here.
sheldon_cooper Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. Very interesting.
penny Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.
sheldon_cooper Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?
penny I did, still a mess.
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
sheldon_cooper jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny?
leonard_hofstadter jISovbe’
amy_farrah_fowler Why are you speaking Klingon?
sheldon_cooper Why are you speaking English?
amy_farrah_fowler This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?
penny Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
amy_farrah_fowler Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
penny Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble.
sheldon_cooper Oh, wait, stop that.
amy_farrah_fowler You stop that.
sheldon_cooper Dayaj’a’
leonard_hofstadter ghobe’
sheldon_cooper Qu’vatlh
penny Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
leonard_hofstadter Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
sheldon_cooper How could you lie to me?
penny Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?
penny What? Tha… That is not true.
leonard_hofstadter Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.
penny Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
leonard_hofstadter You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
penny Uh, did you notice your key chain?
leonard_hofstadter Where’s Batman?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
penny Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
bernadette_rostenkowski One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
howard_wolowitz It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv
amy_farrah_fowler Everybody stop it with that.
raj_koothrappali I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.
amy_farrah_fowler And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
howard_wolowitz You’re up, blabby.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.
amy_farrah_fowler I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.
sheldon_cooper It’s all right.
leonard_hofstadter And?
penny And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
raj_koothrappali Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?
sheldon_cooper Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you saying you’d like to live with me?
sheldon_cooper I’m open to the possibility.
penny Ubamy bube cubool.
amy_farrah_fowler Whatever.
howard_wolowitz You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.
penny That’s a great idea.
leonard_hofstadter Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
raj_koothrappali That would be amazing.
sheldon_cooper Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room.
leonard_hofstadter But you won’t be living here.
sheldon_cooper But that’s my room.
leonard_hofstadter But you won’t be living here.
sheldon_cooper But that’s my room.
leonard_hofstadter You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.
penny Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
sheldon_cooper But that’s my room.
all@ But you won’t be living here.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you for understanding.
sheldon_cooper Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.
amy_farrah_fowler Good night.
sheldon_cooper Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. It, it could be.
sheldon_cooper Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.
amy_farrah_fowler Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.
sheldon_cooper I hate your apartment.
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry, you brought it up?
sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
sheldon_cooper But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper I’m not a child, don’t do that.
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
penny Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.
leonard_hofstadter I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
penny Do you really mean that?
leonard_hofstadter I really do.
penny Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah? What are you keeping?
penny That candle and you.
leonard_hofstadter What about my robot poster?
penny Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
amy_farrah_fowler Can it be more of an internal struggle?
sheldon_cooper I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.
amy_farrah_fowler How about if I just don’t breathe at all?
sheldon_cooper That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, Sheldon.
penny We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
sheldon_cooper No.
amy_farrah_fowler What is happening?
howard_wolowitz Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?
sheldon_cooper Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
raj_koothrappali We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Over my assless chaps you will.
howard_wolowitz This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali Do you like living with her?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Do you know what you need to do now?
sheldon_cooper Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
amy_farrah_fowler I understand. I’ll leave you be.
sheldon_cooper What, you’re familiar with the reference?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
sheldon_cooper Exactly.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
sheldon_cooper Really?
amy_farrah_fowler Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.
sheldon_cooper Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.
sheldon_cooper Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.
penny Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
leonard_hofstadter Wow.
penny I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.
penny Oh, that means so much. I love you.
leonard_hofstadter I love you, too.
leonard_hofstadter Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny.
