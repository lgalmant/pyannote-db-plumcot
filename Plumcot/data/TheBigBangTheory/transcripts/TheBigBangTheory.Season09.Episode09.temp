raj Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
howard No. How does it work?
raj You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?
siri The time is 6:37 p.m.
howard So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
raj Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
howard Oh. Cool. Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
raj I don’t sound like that.
siri Here are some images of naked grandma butts.
sheldon Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?
leonard Well, we’re having everyone over.
penny Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.
leonard Otherwise we’d love to.
penny But we can’t.
leonard Yeah, poor us.
penny Mm-hmm.
bernadette And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.
sheldon Well, Howard, what about you?
howard Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too.
bernadette You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
howard If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?
amy Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?
sheldon Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.
amy No one can go with you?
sheldon No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like.
amy Oh. Okay. Thank you.
sheldon And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
amy Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.
sheldon You don’t think that will be awkward?
amy Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine.
sheldon Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
amy See you then.
sheldon Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.
amy Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?
sheldon And there goes my list.
emily So, how does this work?
bernadette The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.
howard Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long.
raj Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
howard I happen to be a giving and generous lover.
emily Are you and I close enough for me to say that’s creepy?
bernadette We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.
soup_kitchen_manager Uh, can I help you?
bernadette Hi. We’d like to volunteer.
soup_kitchen_manager Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.
bernadette Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
howard Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
emily Are you and I close enough for me to say…
bernadette That he’s an ass? He beat you to it.
soup_kitchen_manager I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.
bernadette Oh, great. We’d love to help.
howard Wipe that smug smile off your face.
bernadette I can’t.
penny Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
leonard I know. I feel so grown up.
penny Sweetie, you are grown up.
leonard Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?
penny Yep. What’s the code?
leonard My birthday.
penny It’s not working.
leonard It’s just the four digits, month and day.
penny Nope.
leonard Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?
penny Uh.
leonard You don’t know my birthday, do you?
penny Yes, I do.
leonard Well, what is it?
penny May.
leonard May what?
penny I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
leonard You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
penny Well, you don’t know everything about me.
leonard Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.
penny Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
sheldon Hello.
amy Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
sheldon I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.
amy If that makes you more comfortable.
sheldon If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?
amy No. You?
sheldon No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?
amy I might go visit my aunt next week.
sheldon Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
amy No, the one in Bakersfield.
sheldon Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
soup_kitchen_manager We’re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I’ll be around.
howard So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?
bernadette What difference does it make?
howard I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.
raj You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!
howard It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing.
sheldon and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.
amy Are we done discussing the weather?
sheldon I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.
amy Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
sheldon All right. Well, what should we talk about?
amy I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.
sheldon Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
amy Man, I walked right into that one.
leonard Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.
penny Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?
leonard Baby.
penny Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?
leonard Justin.
penny Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?
leonard Nice try. NSYNC forever.
penny Damn it.
leonard Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…
penny Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?
leonard Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
penny Interesting. I never told you that.
leonard Sure you did.
penny No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
leonard What? I didn’t know you had a journal.
penny I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.
leonard No, it doesn’t.
raj You know, this reminds me of high school.
emily You worked in a restaurant?
raj No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.
howard All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad.
emly Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.
howard We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?
raj You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.
howard Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.
raj No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being.
howard Huh. Okay, I’ll try it.
soup_kitchen_manager I need three people out front.
bernadette I’ll do it.
raj Me.
emily Right here!
howard No fair, I was meditating.
leonard Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.
penny How can reading my journal be an accident?
leonard I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
penny Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?
leonard You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.
penny All right. Let’s just finish cooking.
leonard Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.
penny Okay, really, I’m fine.
leonard Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.
penny Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.
leonard Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”
penny Does it really say that?
leonard Why would I lie?
penny OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?
leonard Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.
sheldon I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
amy No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.
sheldon All right.
amy So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.
sheldon Just a few.
amy Go ahead.
sheldon How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.
amy Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
sheldon Is that regular or honey nut?
amy I mixed them.
sheldon You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
amy Just one. Are you doing okay?
sheldon I am.
amy Good. I want you to be happy.
sheldon I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
man Here you go.
howard Thanks. You got to be kidding me.
man Sorry?
howard Y, you’re Elon Musk.
elon I am.
howard Wh, what are you doing here?
elon I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.
howard Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.
elon Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?
howard Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer.
elon And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
howard Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.
elon Well, you’re here on Thanksgiving, so you’re probably a good person.
howard Oh. I made my wife come down, too.
elon You think you might ever get back out to space?
howard Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.
elon Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.
howard Thank you.
elon Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?
howard A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.
sheldon You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.
amy You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
sheldon They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.
amy Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.
sheldon Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
amy Sure. What is it?
sheldon It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.
amy So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
sheldon What is that?
amy It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill.
sheldon Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.
amy Let’s just play.
sheldon I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.
amy Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.
sheldon Very well done.
amy Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.
sheldon Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?
amy But you can pal around with a hagfish?
sheldon Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.
amy Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.
sheldon I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down.
amy I miss this.
sheldon How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?
amy I guess sometimes I’m silly.
penny Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
leonard Be right there. Hi, lover.
penny What are you doing?
leonard I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
penny I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.
leonard Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?
penny Oh.
leonard Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?
bernadette Happy Thanks… Yikes.
leonard I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.
sheldon Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.
penny Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.
sheldon Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello.
amy Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s.
sheldon Did you have a nice time?
amy I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.
sheldon Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.
amy It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again.
sheldon Oh. I thought we were just friends.
amy We are. But I was hoping, maybe…
sheldon Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.
amy Okay. I understand.
sheldon Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.
amy Okay. Sure.
