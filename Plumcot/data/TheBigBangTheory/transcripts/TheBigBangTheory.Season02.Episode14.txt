leonard_hofstadter Hmmm.
sheldon_cooper The problem appears to be unsolvable.
raj_koothrappali Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
howard_wolowitz There are too many variables. It would take forever.
leonard_hofstadter We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
sheldon_cooper Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.
leonard_hofstadter Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.
raj_koothrappali What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
sheldon_cooper They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
raj_koothrappali We could eat after the movie.
sheldon_cooper Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work.
raj_koothrappali Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.
howard_wolowitz Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?
raj_koothrappali That’s how we missed it.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I guess we only have one option.
raj_koothrappali Yep, I don’t see any way around it.
leonard_hofstadter Bye, Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz See ya.
raj_koothrappali Later, dude.
sheldon_cooper They’re right, it was the only option.
penny Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.
sheldon_cooper Why?
penny Just do it! Get inside and shut the door.
sheldon_cooper Well, you didn’t specify.
penny Is Leonard around?
sheldon_cooper He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?
penny The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.
penny It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
sheldon_cooper If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.
penny Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
sheldon_cooper You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.
penny Yes, it occurs to me, too.
sheldon_cooper Hang on a moment. Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
penny Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
sheldon_cooper That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
penny Don’t be silly.
sheldon_cooper I’m never silly. Here.
penny No, I can’t.
sheldon_cooper Don’t you need money?
penny Well, yeah, but…
sheldon_cooper This is money I’m not using.
penny But what if you need it?
sheldon_cooper My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.
penny Really? I mean, are you sure?
sheldon_cooper I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
penny Are they working on that?
sheldon_cooper I sincerely hope so.
penny Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can’t. Sheldon honey, I don’t want things to be weird between us.
sheldon_cooper Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
penny I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.
sheldon_cooper Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
penny I’m regretting this already.
sheldon_cooper You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.
leonard_hofstadter Interesting.
sheldon_cooper Ask me why.
leonard_hofstadter Do I have to?
sheldon_cooper Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. How was work?
penny Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
sheldon_cooper Was that sarcasm?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Was that sarcasm?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Was that sarca..
leonard_hofstadter Stop it!
sheldon_cooper Penny, you appear to have a package here.
penny Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
sheldon_cooper Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
leonard_hofstadter He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating.
penny Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?
sheldon_cooper All right.
penny Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?
leonard_hofstadter Weird.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure.
leonard_hofstadter Did you guys have an argument?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.
sheldon_cooper I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked.
leonard_hofstadter Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.
howard_wolowitz It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
leonard_hofstadter Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.
penny Thank you, Leonard. What’s my share?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
penny No, really, how much?
leonard_hofstadter It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.
penny Well, which is it, ten or eleven?
leonard_hofstadter Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one.
penny What?
howard_wolowitz He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
penny What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?
penny ‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody! What was that about?
howard_wolowitz He has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
penny Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.
leonard_hofstadter It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Dinner’s here.
penny Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
penny You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.
sheldon_cooper Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.
penny Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wait, you lent her money?
penny She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
penny Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills.
leonard_hofstadter Where are you going?
penny Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
sheldon_cooper In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can.
leonard_hofstadter But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter A little mood lighting, huh?
penny Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, they’re very considerate that way.
penny I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.
leonard_hofstadter Fourteen dollars, huh?
penny Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it.
leonard_hofstadter Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him.
penny Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem.
leonard_hofstadter So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
penny Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what was the plan?
penny Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
leonard_hofstadter Was there a plan B?
penny TV star.
leonard_hofstadter It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
penny Oh, no, I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress.
leonard_hofstadter You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
penny That is not the definition of professional.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
penny Oh, that’s nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.
penny Well, remember Kurt?
leonard_hofstadter Your ex-boyfriend?
penny Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny He was drunk.
leonard_hofstadter I would hope so.
penny Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.
leonard_hofstadter Did he pay you back?
penny No, but he will.
leonard_hofstadter And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
penny Leonard, I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.
leonard_hofstadter Well what are you gonna do?
penny I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that.
penny Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?
penny Well, do you know anybody?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.
penny Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
penny And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
howard_wolowitz Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
howard_wolowitz Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, what’s going on?
raj_koothrappali We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
howard_wolowitz You want the Valley of Fire? It’s right here.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?
sheldon_cooper Outside? I just made cocoa.
leonard_hofstadter – Come on. It’ll be fun.
howard_wolowitz What is it?
leonard_hofstadter Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt? Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, double sixes.
leonard_hofstadter Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
raj_koothrappali Oh, cool, I got a sword.
leonard_hofstadter I could use some help.
raj_koothrappali Here.
leonard_hofstadter You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?
leonard_hofstadter I do.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not afraid of him.
sheldon_cooper All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
sheldon_cooper They did.
leonard_hofstadter Well?
sheldon_cooper They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.
raj_koothrappali Plus, no one stole their pants.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little.
leonard_hofstadter You guys suck. Come on, please? He’s so big.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
howard_wolowitz Yes. Koothrappali’s going to wet himself, I’m gonna throw up, Sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?
leonard_hofstadter Guys, there are four of us and one of him.
sheldon_cooper Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.
raj_koothrappali I should’ve peed before we left.
kurt Yeah?
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Kurt.
kurt Lenny, right?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.
kurt No. What do you want?
sheldon_cooper You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, not now.
sheldon_cooper I remember him.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.
kurt And she sent you to get it from me?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.
kurt You do?
leonard_hofstadter Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.
kurt She’ll get it when she gets it.
howard_wolowitz Well, there you go. Problem solved.
raj_koothrappali A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
leonard_hofstadter No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off.
sheldon_cooper I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Leonard, let’s go
leonard_hofstadter No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
leonard_hofstadter I guess, technically, that was my fault. I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.
kurt What happened to your backup?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.
howard_wolowitz Maybe we should have your head notarized.
raj_koothrappali If anybody cares, I still have to pee.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey, is Sheldon here?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
penny Nice hat.
leonard_hofstadter It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
penny Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Penny.
penny Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?
penny Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Did he say why?
penny Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
penny Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Bye.
sheldon_cooper Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
sheldon_cooper That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.
