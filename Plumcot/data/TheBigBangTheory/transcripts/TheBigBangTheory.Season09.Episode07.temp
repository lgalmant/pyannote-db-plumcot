leonard Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
raj Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.
penny In school?
raj Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.
penny Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
leonard You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
sheldon Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
leonard Why is he writing to you?
sheldon Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it.
raj Oh. Hey, high five.
sheldon Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?
penny Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
sheldon This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful.
bernadette Hey. You got a minute?
howard Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
bernadette Pause the game, Howard.
howard Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?
bernadette We need to talk about redecorating this place.
howard Oh, no, not this again.
bernadette Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.
howard Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?
bernadette All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.
howard May I say something?
bernadette Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
howard Never mind.
sheldon Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life.
leonard I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.
penny And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
sheldon Hello.
wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.
adam Nice to meet you.
sheldon Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.
wil I told you. This guy is gold.
bernadette Whatcha doing?
howard Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.
bernadette Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.
howard I’m listening.
bernadette Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.
howard That is reasonable. But what room?
bernadette How ’bout this one?
howard No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.
bernadette Then how ’bout the bathroom?
howard I want to change my answer.
bernadette Fine. Then the dining room.
howard I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
bernadette Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.
adam All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera’s not here.
sheldon All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
leonard How long have you known Adam?
wil A few years.
leonard And what are you getting him back for?
adam Let’s start with your name and occupation.
sheldon Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.
adam And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?
adam What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
sheldon I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.
penny Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.
leonard My brother was mean to me, too.
penny Yeah, you probably had it coming.
adam Do you have any Spock collectibles?
sheldon I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.
penny Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.
adam Can we see the napkin?
sheldon Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
leonard When did we get a wall safe?
sheldon When there was no more room in the floor safe.
leonard When did we get a floor safe?
sheldon When we got the security camera.
leonard There’s a security camera?
sheldon Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.
penny Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.
sheldon Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.
raj So, your father-in-law is in there right now?
howard Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
raj Oh, okay. Got it.
howard Hey. What’s going on?
raj Hey.
bernadette Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.
raj You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.
mr_rostenkowski What’s so great about it?
raj I’m sorry. I did what I could.
bernadette Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
howard Your dad’s on your side.
bernadette He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.
raj That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.
howard Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.
raj Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
howard When is your visa up?
sheldon Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.
wil Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?
sheldon No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.
penny Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?
sheldon Wouldn’t you like to know?
penny I would.
sheldon All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.
leonard You have a will?
sheldon Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.
leonard Will Wil want it?
wil Wil won’t.
penny Oh, what’s that ring box?
sheldon Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
penny What?
leonard You bought her a ring?
sheldon No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.
wil Sheldon, that’s awful.
sheldon No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.
penny Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?
sheldon No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
leonard Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.
sheldon No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.
penny I know. It just…
sheldon I said I’m fine! We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?
adam Did you find that helpful?
sheldon Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.
penny I knew I could smell ’em.
adam What about from when you were a kid?
sheldon Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
adam Did it work?
sheldon Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.
adam That must have been very upsetting for you.
sheldon Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.
penny Oh pfft.
sheldon Excuse me?
penny I’m sorry. I’m not here.
sheldon No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
penny Um.
leonard You did go pfft.
penny All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.
leonard Just like you.
penny I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.
sheldon Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.
penny Sweetie, you’re yelling.
sheldon Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.
wil This documentary is gonna be awesome.
mr_rostenkowski You gonna be okay down here?
howard Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.
mr_rostenkowski Yeah, that’s a rat skull.
howard Oh.
mr_rostenkowski Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more.
howard Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?
mr_rostenkowski Yeah. I think that’s the den.
howard Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.
mr_rostenkowski Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.
howard Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?
mr_rostenkowski ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.
howard That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.
mr_rostenkowski Huh.
howard I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…
bernadette Earthquake.
howard Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.
bernadette Aftershock.
penny I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.
leonard I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
penny Yeah.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Hey, buddy. How you doing?
sheldon Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
leonard Oh, yeah.
penny Definitely.
sheldon Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.
penny Do you know what that means?
leonard No.
penny Are you telling the truth?
leonard Nirsh.
sheldon Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.
penny What are you gonna do?
sheldon I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.
leonard He didn’t meant that.
bernadette So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
howard That would be nice.
bernadette I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.
howard But you were okay throwing me under the bus?
bernadette Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.
mr_rostenkowski Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.
bernadette Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?
mr_rostenkowski This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.
raj It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.
howard Why are you still here?
raj Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.
howard All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.
bernadette Why?
howard Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.
bernadette Okay, I’ll think about it.
howard And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?
bernadette It’s an actual I’ll think about it.
howard I really believe I’d be a great dad.
bernadette I know you would.
howard Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?
kirk Dr. Dana feels he isn’t that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
spock Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is logic.
sheldon Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?
leonard Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.
sheldon Those are very wise words.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
