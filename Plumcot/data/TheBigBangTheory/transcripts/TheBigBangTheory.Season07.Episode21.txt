penny So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
penny But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.
leonard_hofstadter It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.
penny Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I could use your assistance.
leonard_hofstadter Sure. What’s up?
sheldon_cooper Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?
leonard_hofstadter Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.
sheldon_cooper That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…
penny Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
sheldon_cooper It is just so frustrating.
penny ‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
penny Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?
leonard_hofstadter You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
penny Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?
sheldon_cooper All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.
leonard_hofstadter Great, what do you want to do?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. What do you want to do?
penny I don’t know. What do you want to do?
leonard_hofstadter I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.
sheldon_cooper Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?
leonard_hofstadter What can we do that’s different?
penny What can we do that’s free?
sheldon_cooper Oh, got it. We order a pizza.
penny Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.
penny Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.
sheldon_cooper Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper All right.
leonard_hofstadter Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?
penny No. Bernadette’s working late.
sheldon_cooper Amy’s sick.
leonard_hofstadter Aw. What’s wrong with her?
sheldon_cooper Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not what I meant.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?
leonard_hofstadter What ails her?
sheldon_cooper Oh. Who knows?
penny Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.
howard_wolowitz Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.
raj_koothrappali No problem. How’s your mom feeling?
howard_wolowitz Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine.
raj_koothrappali You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.
howard_wolowitz Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?
raj_koothrappali I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
howard_wolowitz Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.
raj_koothrappali Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?
howard_wolowitz A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.
raj_koothrappali I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.
howard_wolowitz That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.
raj_koothrappali Uh, so, you’ll watch it?
howard_wolowitz Sure.
raj_koothrappali You’re a good friend. I owe you one.
debbie_wolowitz Howard. Help me get out of the tub.
raj_koothrappali Not that one.
sheldon_cooper So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?
penny Yep.
sheldon_cooper Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?
sheldon_cooper Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.
penny What the hell? What? She’s not working late.
sheldon_cooper And Amy doesn’t look sick.
penny Why would they lie to us?
sheldon_cooper That’s a good question. Amy and Bernadette. Amy and Bernadette. Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?
raj_koothrappali Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.
howard_wolowitz I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you.
raj_koothrappali You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.
howard_wolowitz Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets.
raj_koothrappali All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.
penny You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?
sheldon_cooper And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.
bernadette_rostenkowski We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
amy_farrah_fowler But none of that means we don’t love you.
penny I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
leonard_hofstadter I also love you.
penny Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Where are we going?
penny We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.
sheldon_cooper Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…
penny Shut up.
penny What’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.
penny It’s fusion.
sheldon_cooper My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
penny Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?
sheldon_cooper Not at all.
penny Thank you.
sheldon_cooper But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.
penny Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.
sheldon_cooper I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
raj_koothrappali Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.
howard_wolowitz And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
raj_koothrappali On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?
howard_wolowitz What difference does it make?
raj_koothrappali What do you mean?
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her.
raj_koothrappali I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
amy_farrah_fowler I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter He’d probably give you homework.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
bernadette_rostenkowski Of course.
amy_farrah_fowler And you don’t feel guilty about it?
bernadette_rostenkowski Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice.
leonard_hofstadter Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.
penny Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.
sheldon_cooper Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch.
penny Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.
sheldon_cooper This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.
penny Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not.
penny How is that not good?
sheldon_cooper Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.
penny Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours.
sheldon_cooper Have you ever paid for a meal?
penny Not with money. Read.
sheldon_cooper Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
penny Oh, try again.
howard_wolowitz Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.
raj_koothrappali I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
howard_wolowitz Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.
raj_koothrappali What?
howard_wolowitz I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.
penny Oh, I think I see our next stop.
sheldon_cooper You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.
penny No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.
sheldon_cooper Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.
leonard_hofstadter You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?
amy_farrah_fowler I know, it’s weird, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. We should do it more often.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, it’s Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler Is she still mad?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.
amy_farrah_fowler A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.
leonard_hofstadter Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.
amy_farrah_fowler Because she has sex with you.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, she does.
amy_farrah_fowler Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
amy_farrah_fowler I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.
leonard_hofstadter Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? What did you do?
leonard_hofstadter Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.
bernadette_rostenkowski I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.
sheldon_cooper I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.
penny All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.
sheldon_cooper Okay, I just did. What was it?
penny Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.
sheldon_cooper For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.
penny Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with.
sheldon_cooper That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with.
penny Oh, oh, here we go.
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 Does she have dark hair?
penny Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.
sheldon_cooper The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 Does she work in a similar field to you?
sheldon_cooper Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 They’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.
penny Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.
penny Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.
psychic#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.
sheldon_cooper You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey.
penny Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before.
raj_koothrappali Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.
emily_sweeney Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.
raj_koothrappali Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.
emily_sweeney Okay.
raj_koothrappali And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.
emily_sweeney I wonder that, too.
raj_koothrappali Then, why do you watch these things?
emily_sweeney Can I tell you something without you judging me?
raj_koothrappali Sure.
emily_sweeney They kind of turn me on.
raj_koothrappali And play.
sheldon_cooper Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.
sheldon_cooper And how do you propose to do that? Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this.
