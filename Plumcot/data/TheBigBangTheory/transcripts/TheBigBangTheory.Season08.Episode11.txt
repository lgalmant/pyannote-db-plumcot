penny Hey, how are things going with your parents?
sheldon_cooper You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.
penny You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire.
raj_koothrappali Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
amy_farrah_fowler If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.
raj_koothrappali That would be nice.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
sheldon_cooper Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re going.
sheldon_cooper Why do you hate me?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t hate you. I love you.
sheldon_cooper Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.
raj_koothrappali Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
howard_wolowitz I agree.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
penny Me, too.
raj_koothrappali You guys suck.
leonard_hofstadter You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen.
howard_wolowitz We should get going to Amy’s.
leonard_hofstadter Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
howard_wolowitz I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty.
leonard_hofstadter Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
howard_wolowitz How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
leonard_hofstadter You shut the loading doors, right?
howard_wolowitz I thought you did.
leonard_hofstadter Do you know what a disaster this is?
howard_wolowitz You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?
leonard_hofstadter What do we do? Should we call someone?
howard_wolowitz And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, how do we catch it?
howard_wolowitz Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a moth.
howard_wolowitz Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?
howard_wolowitz Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do.
penny So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?
dr_vm_koothrappali Twenty hours.
penny Oh, that’s rough.
dr_vm_koothrappali Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?
raj_koothrappali Can we please talk about anything else?
dr_vm_koothrappali Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?
penny Oh, great. Everything’s good.
dr_vm_koothrappali I see you got engaged.
penny Yes, we did.
dr_vm_koothrappali Let me tell you a story.
raj_koothrappali Dad.
dr_vm_koothrappali Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s going on?
raj_koothrappali There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
dr_vm_koothrappali You want me to come?
raj_koothrappali Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
dr_vm_koothrappali Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.
penny You’re just gonna leave him here?
dr_vm_koothrappali Relax, he says.
raj_koothrappali Yup. Bye.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
bernadette_rostenkowski Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?
sheldon_cooper Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
sheldon_cooper My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
sheldon_cooper Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
sheldon_cooper Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s just excited about the holidays.
sheldon_cooper Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.
bernadette_rostenkowski How?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
sheldon_cooper I’m going to buy her a present.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.
sheldon_cooper With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.
bernadette_rostenkowski Then you’re both sad?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
bernadette_rostenkowski So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
sheldon_cooper That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.
howard_wolowitz Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.
leonard_hofstadter A Slim Jim?
howard_wolowitz It’s all I could find. It’ll work.
leonard_hofstadter Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, what’s your plan?
leonard_hofstadter I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.
howard_wolowitz And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
leonard_hofstadter No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.
howard_wolowitz Why do you keep assuming it was me?
leonard_hofstadter Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.
howard_wolowitz Like when?
leonard_hofstadter What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?
howard_wolowitz Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
howard_wolowitz Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
leonard_hofstadter I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
raj_koothrappali Hey, what’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
raj_koothrappali Should have put it in the bag first.
penny So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?
dr_vm_koothrappali It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?
penny No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.
penny Like what?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.
penny Sorry. She’s taken, too.
howard_wolowitz You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
leonard_hofstadter And you found somebody you could push around?
raj_koothrappali Hey.
howard_wolowitz Stay out of this.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
howard_wolowitz You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me.
raj_koothrappali Actually.
howard_wolowitz I said, stay out of it.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
raj_koothrappali All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.
howard_wolowitz Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.
raj_koothrappali No, you’re the one who let him in.
howard_wolowitz How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?
raj_koothrappali Come on.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about that sweater?
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, you really do love her.
sheldon_cooper I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
amy_farrah_fowler You won.
penny Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?
dr_vm_koothrappali You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.
penny Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.
dr_vm_koothrappali Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
penny Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
santa All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?
sheldon_cooper Correct.
santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
sheldon_cooper There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
photographer Smile.
santa Ho, ho. ho.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
howard_wolowitz Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
leonard_hofstadter Do you want the fire extinguisher?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I do.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Here you go.
howard_wolowitz Okay. One, two, three.
raj_koothrappali Uh, you have to take the pin out.
leonard_hofstadter You miss the blanket now, don’t you?
howard_wolowitz On three. One, two, three.
raj_koothrappali What did you do?
howard_wolowitz It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter Relax, it wasn’t your fault.
howard_wolowitz Uh, maybe it’s just stunned.
raj_koothrappali Dude, it’s not breathing.
howard_wolowitz Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.
raj_koothrappali What do you mean, not again?
howard_wolowitz When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
howard_wolowitz Great. Do it.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
raj_koothrappali I’ll do it.
howard_wolowitz No. I need to do it. This is on me.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
raj_koothrappali Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.
leonard_hofstadter Anything?
howard_wolowitz I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait, his wing moved.
howard_wolowitz Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.
raj_koothrappali It’s a Christmas miracle.
howard_wolowitz I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain.
raj_koothrappali Someone should really close that loading door.
raj_koothrappali Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
howard_wolowitz You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.
leonard_hofstadter No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?
penny It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
penny Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?
leonard_hofstadter No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.
penny So erase them and walk out.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t do that.
howard_wolowitz Can’t do what?
leonard_hofstadter She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
howard_wolowitz We can’t do that.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter@raj_koothrappali Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.
raj_koothrappali Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.
sheldon_cooper If you like raisins.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. And it’s figs.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.
bernadette_rostenkowski You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
howard_wolowitz It smelled too much like blue jay.
dr_vm_koothrappali Can I help you clean up?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.
sheldon_cooper Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?
penny Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you hate giving gifts.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
amy_farrah_fowler You got me something?
sheldon_cooper Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
amy_farrah_fowler Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.
sheldon_cooper Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
amy_farrah_fowler No, I love it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Well, how about now? Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I did get you something.
sheldon_cooper But what about our agreement?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you got me something. Here.
sheldon_cooper Cookies?
amy_farrah_fowler They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
sheldon_cooper They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
amy_farrah_fowler Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
penny Of course it is.
amy_farrah_fowler One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
raj_koothrappali If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy.
