howard So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?
leonard Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.
howard All right.
raj You suck, Wolowitz.
howard What’s that about?
raj I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.
sheldon He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck.
penny Hi. What’s going on?
leonard Baseball.
penny Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.
leonard He’s practicing.
penny For what?
howard The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?
penny What, you? Really?
howard Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me.
penny That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
sheldon Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
penny I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
leonard C’mon now, throw one.
howard All right, here we go.
raj You look like a jackass.
howard Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.
leonard Now you know why we’re not outside.
sheldon Did you enjoy my lecture?
amy No, and neither did our waiter.
sheldon Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.
amy It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
penny Hey, how was dinner?
sheldon Good, I had Cornish game hen.
leonard Oh, that poor waiter.
amy Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?
penny You guys are going out two nights in a row?
sheldon I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.
penny That’s so hot.
amy It’s better than hot, it’s binding.
sheldon If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date.
penny Aw.
amy You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.
sheldon Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.
bernadette I can’t believe you’re sore.
howard Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.
bernadette But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.
howard For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.
bernadette I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
howard They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no.
bernadette Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.
howard Thank you, that would be great.
bernadette Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.
howard What’s wrong with the way I run?
penny Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.
sheldon At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.
amy I then suggested a pub.
sheldon Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.
leonard You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.
sheldon No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.
amy After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.
leonard Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
sheldon Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours.
penny Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
sheldon I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.
leonard You don’t honestly think that, do you?
sheldon Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.
leonard There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.
penny Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
leonard That’s the part you have a problem with?
penny Relax.
amy There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.
raj So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?
howard Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.
bernadette All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.
howard Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?
bernadette Keep going.
howard How about now?
bernadette I’ll let you know.
howard Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?
bernadette Okay, stop.
howard Are you kidding me?!
bernadette That’s sixty feet.
howard There’s no way this is sixty feet.
bernadette I’m looking at it.
howard You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
leonard Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?
sheldon For starters, we enjoy spending time together.
leonard So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
sheldon It’s called parallel play.
leonard Yeah, toddlers do that.
sheldon Not as well as we do.
leonard You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
penny So what? Why do you even care?
sheldon Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.
leonard Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
sheldon If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.
amy It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire.
bernadette Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.
howard That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.
bernadette Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with.
raj Come on Howard, fire it in.
bernadette Throw the damn ball!
amy So when do you guys plan on getting married?
penny Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.
sheldon May I have one of your fries?
amy Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
sheldon Absolutely not.
leonard Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.
sheldon It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
leonard I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
sheldon Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.
leonard How ridiculous is he?
penny A hundred.
leonard Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.
sheldon No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig.
penny Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.
sheldon Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.
penny Oh, what did those rascals do now?
amy They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.
sheldon Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.
leonard So, this is accurate?
sheldon It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.
penny Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.
sheldon Kind of? It does it perfectly.
amy Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
leonard Fine. We’ll take it right now.
penny No, don’t.
leonard What?
penny Just don’t take it.
leonard Why not?
penny ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?
leonard Come on. It’ll be fun.
penny I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.
leonard Sorry.
amy I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.
bernadette Think he’s getting any better?
raj Yup.
howard That was a close one.
bernadette Okay.
raj Is it too late for him to cancel?
bernadette I think so.
howard Heads up! Watch out!
leonard Are you mad at me?
penny No, stop being stupid.
leonard Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?
penny Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.
leonard What are you worried about?
penny That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.
leonard Yeah, that scares me, too.
penny It does?
leonard Sometimes.
penny Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.
leonard Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.
mike Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?
howard Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?
mike Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?
howard Why shouldn’t I do it?
mike There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.
howard But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?
mike That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.
howard Well, maybe I’ll do a good job.
mike I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.
howard Okay, thanks for the pep talk.
mike Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her.
bernadette He’s so nice.
penny Hey, sorry about that.
amy No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.
sheldon Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.
leonard I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
sheldon The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.
leonard I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
penny Let’s just take the test.
leonard No, no, no, I don’t want to.
penny Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.
leonard Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
sheldon Or a one. A one is possible.
leonard Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.
penny Leonard.
amy It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
sheldon We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy.
raj Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.
penny Look at you, talking sports.
leonard This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.
sheldon Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
amy Sheldon, what did you expect?
sheldon I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.
amy I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.
sheldon Who’s the bobblehead of?
amy Does it matter?
sheldon No, as long as it bobbles.
bernadette Howie, I am so proud of you.
howard Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.
man You ready?
howard Let’s do it.
man All right.
howard Wish me luck.
bernadette Go get ’em.
stadium_announcer Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
howard Thank you. Thank you.
penny Can he really throw a ball?
leonard On our Quidditch team, he…
penny Yeah, that’s a no.
howard I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.
bernadette Why is it going so slow?
howard ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.
sheldon Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.
howard Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about Mars.
man_in_crowd You suck, Wolowitz!
sheldon He makes a valid point.
howard Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster.
