howard Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn’t matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!
raj That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?
sheldon I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.
leonard I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
sheldon Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
leonard I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!
raj You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
sheldon You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good.
leonard Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
sheldon No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.
leonard Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.
howard A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother’s house.
raj Where would you go?
howard I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
raj You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.
howard What’s that? Some weird sex thing?
raj No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?
leonard I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell.
howard Sounds like we’re in business.
raj I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Oh!
raj Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?
leonard I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord, shush.
leonard What?
sheldon You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?
penny Who, me?
howard Sheldon, I don’t think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
sheldon The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
leonard She’s not going to steal our idea.
penny What idea?
leonard We’re gonna write an application…
sheldon The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…
penny Okay, stop, stop!
sheldon Of Texas.
penny Whatever your secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, so I’m not interested.
leonard It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…
penny Bored.
leonard Satisfied?
sheldon Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
penny Hey, wait a minute.
howard Well, hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
sheldon Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
howard Hey, I…
penny Hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
sheldon She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.
leonard That is ridiculous.
sheldon Oh, is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.
penny Oh, great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this.
howard There’s your answer, free food.
sheldon All right, I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.
raj Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
sheldon A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
raj Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
sheldon Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.
howard Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
sheldon Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present.
leonard Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
sheldon Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks.
leonard Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge.
sheldon Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder.
leonard Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
sheldon You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.
leonard Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
raj Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
sheldon All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.
leonard Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed.
leonard So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
sheldon Good one, boss.
leonard What?
sheldon This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
leonard It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
sheldon In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?
leonard Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.
sheldon Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.
leonard Are you done?
sheldon If you say so, boss.
howard So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…
sheldon How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
raj So it spells Sheldon?
sheldon Does it? A happy accident.
leonard We’re not doing names now. Howard?
howard Like I was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
sheldon All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?
leonard No.
sheldon Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
leonard That’s just Sheldon backwards.
sheldon Another happy accident.
leonard We’re not wasting time with names right now.
sheldon I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
leonard No.
sheldon Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
leonard No.
howard Again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
sheldon I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
leonard Oh Sheldon, stop it.
sheldon When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…
leonard That’s enough, Sheldon.
sheldon All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.
leonard Okay, that’s it, you’re fired.
sheldon Really? Why?
leonard Because you’re impossible to work with.
sheldon I see. And is that open for discussion?
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.
leonard But I fired you.
sheldon Oh, I know. I’m now an independent contractor.
leonard No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
sheldon But I made it better.
leonard I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
sheldon Well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants.
leonard What the hell are bus pants?
sheldon They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man.
leonard Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends.
sheldon Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.
leonard You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
raj Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?
howard It means after we play handball, I’m showering at home.
sheldon Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.
raj World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
sheldon Don’t thank me. You earned it.
howard Howard Wolowitz. Why not World’s Greatest Engineer?
sheldon I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.
howard We’re not quitting on Leonard.
sheldon I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
raj What are you talking about?
sheldon Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back.
howard Okay, let’s try this one. Spherical Hankel function.
leonard Hold on. That’s it!
howard Eureka!
raj Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.
howard Fine. Let’s say it together.
raj No. The moment has passed.
sheldon Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?
raj You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?
sheldon Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?
leonard We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
sheldon Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress.
leonard Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?
howard No. It’s a little tricky. I’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
leonard What are you doing?!
sheldon Playing the theremin.
leonard No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
sheldon Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.
leonard Sheldon! We’re working here!
sheldon That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. Well, that was a little uncalled for.
leonard No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
sheldon So, your project is more important than mine?
leonard Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
sheldon Don’t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don’t want me here, just say the word, and I’ll leave.
sheldon Could have beaten around the bush a little.
sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.
penny What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
sheldon I’m practicing my theremin.
penny Oh.
sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.
penny Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
sheldon Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
penny Oh, honey, I’m sorry.
sheldon He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
penny Is that so?
sheldon Yes. And they’re still sticky.
penny Aw.
sheldon Probably going to have to throw them away.
penny Hey, you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
sheldon With you?
penny Seriously, I have a great idea for one.
sheldon Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
penny Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
sheldon That’s your app idea?
penny Well, you don’t like it?
sheldon I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t.
penny Why not?
sheldon Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.
penny And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.
sheldon I know, it’s baffling. Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.
penny Sheldon, I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
sheldon Do you make it with milk or water?
penny Milk.
sheldon Real cocoa?
penny That’s what it says on the packet.
sheldon Do you have those little marshmallows?
penny No, sorry.
sheldon Well, I suppose it’s appropriate.
penny What does that mean?
sheldon A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
raj Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.
leonard I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit.
raj What do you think we should sell it for?
howard Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I’d say about a million dollars a pop.
raj Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.
penny Hi. I’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your Sheldon back.
leonard What’s he doing in your apartment?
penny Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.
leonard Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.
penny Look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?
leonard We’re not playing. This is real work.
howard We’re going to be hundred-aires.
penny Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
leonard Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
penny Okay. Wait right here.
raj I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.
sheldon Really? Leonard wants me back?
penny Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.
sheldon Well, we sure saw that coming.
penny That’s right.
sheldon You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
penny No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
sheldon How?
penny Say you’re sorry.
sheldon Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars.
penny Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?
sheldon No.
penny No?
sheldon I was being sarcastic.
penny Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.
sheldon Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.
penny Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let’s go.
sheldon Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.
penny Oh, you’re welcome.
sheldon Boy, I’m getting good at this.
leonard Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up.
sheldon Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.
leonard Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
sheldon Well, I must say, I am impressed.
leonard Thanks.
sheldon You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
howard We have.
sheldon As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea.
penny Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
sheldon Bored.
penny Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
sheldon Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…
penny Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they’re so cute…
sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…
