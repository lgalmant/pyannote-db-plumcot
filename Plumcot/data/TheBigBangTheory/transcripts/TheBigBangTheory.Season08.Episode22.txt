raj_koothrappali It’s, like, the best one they make, I just can’t get it to work.
howard_wolowitz I’ll figure it out.
raj_koothrappali It streams HD video straight to your phone while it’s flying.
howard_wolowitz Nice. Where were you when I was single?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?
penny Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.
sheldon_cooper If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you’re packed.
amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?
leonard_hofstadter Nope. It’s pretty exciting.
sheldon_cooper Aren’t you afraid of being blinded?
leonard_hofstadter How would I be blinded?
sheldon_cooper At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It’s all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll take my chances.
sheldon_cooper Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
raj_koothrappali Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they’re boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?
howard_wolowitz Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Why do I own one?
amy_farrah_fowler I think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, I thought it’d be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.
amy_farrah_fowler With a beautiful girl on your arm.
sheldon_cooper And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
leonard_hofstadter How’d you get ready so fast?
penny Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.
leonard_hofstadter Why did you need a belt?
penny It’s called an evening look. I’ve never been to New Jersey before.
leonard_hofstadter It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
penny So it’s not really like that?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s like that. Well, I’m excited to show you around.
penny You think we’ll have time to visit your mom over there?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. We’ll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I’m not doing that either. Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight’s been cancelled.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, looks like there’s a big storm all up the East Coast.
penny Well, can we get on another airline?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think so.
penny So, that’s it? We’re not going?
leonard_hofstadter I guess not.
penny Well, that sucks.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.
penny Oh. You could tell it to me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, thank you, but I’m okay.
penny Are you sure? I could pretend I’m a high school cheerleader who can’t control herself around esteemed alumni.
leonard_hofstadter Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.
penny Ooh.
howard_wolowitz Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera’s on, they’re both on the same network. We should be getting an image.
sheldon_cooper All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
howard_wolowitz Maybe we should recalibrate it.
sheldon_cooper All right.
howard_wolowitz Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.
sheldon_cooper It actually says at least?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You see where I’m going with this.
howard_wolowitz Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
sheldon_cooper All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they’re still getting at least one angry letter.
howard_wolowitz Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
sheldon_cooper Initiating rotation sequence. Don’t look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?
howard_wolowitz It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It’s a good thing I didn’t send that letter.
raj_koothrappali Mm. Hello, Daddy. What’s up?
dr_vm_koothrappali Not much, just wanted to see how my son’s doing.
raj_koothrappali Very well, thank you.
dr_vm_koothrappali Are you still dating that dermatologist?
raj_koothrappali If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn’t have to ask.
dr_vm_koothrappali Oh, and there’s something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month’s rent on a toy helicopter?!
raj_koothrappali Oh, you’re where that bill goes.
dr_vm_koothrappali I’m tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It’s time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.
raj_koothrappali No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.
dr_vm_koothrappali No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you’re on your own.
raj_koothrappali But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…
dr_vm_koothrappali I’m cutting you off.
raj_koothrappali Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?
howard_wolowitz No red and yellow, no red and yellow.
sheldon_cooper Yay.
howard_wolowitz It’s green.
sheldon_cooper We did it. Oh, if it’s this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no.
howard_wolowitz Oh. All right, playtime’s over. Let’s open this baby up.
sheldon_cooper Won’t that void the warranty?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I have a master’s degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, where’d you go?
penny I got you a little something to cheer you up.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?
penny Just open it.
leonard_hofstadter A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?
penny Because you are giving your commencement speech.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
penny I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.
leonard_hofstadter Really? That’s amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
penny Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.
leonard_hofstadter Short and sexy, that’s my wheelhouse.
penny Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Boy, oh, boy, that’s a lot of pieces.
sheldon_cooper You know what they all do, right?
howard_wolowitz Yes, of course.
sheldon_cooper What about this one?
howard_wolowitz Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?
sheldon_cooper Not very.
howard_wolowitz That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
sheldon_cooper So, can you get it working?
howard_wolowitz I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I’ve built components for the space station.
sheldon_cooper I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn’t work.
howard_wolowitz It worked fine, it just wasn’t designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
raj_koothrappali I have to return the helicopter. My father… What did you do?
sheldon_cooper Well, don’t worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn’t originate in a Russian man’s colon.
raj_koothrappali I don’t freaking believe this.
howard_wolowitz Relax, it’ll be fine.
raj_koothrappali No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.
sheldon_cooper You can’t return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
raj_koothrappali Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.
howard_wolowitz Calm down.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Okay, you’re right. It’s time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. Hello, Mummy.
mrs_koothrappali Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.
raj_koothrappali Well, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?
mrs_koothrappali Such a sweet boy for asking. Can’t believe you come from the poison seed of your father.
raj_koothrappali Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn’t afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.
mrs_koothrappali What does that mean, active social life?
raj_koothrappali Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.
mrs_koothrappali Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?
raj_koothrappali All I know, Mummy, is that he’s a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there’s no money for your little boy.
mrs_koothrappali Well, however much money your father was giving you, I’ll give you more.
raj_koothrappali Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.
penny What’s taking so long?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think this is gonna work.
penny Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you’re supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.
leonard_hofstadter A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.
penny Oh. Well, you do.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Yeah. You’re gonna be on Skype, they’re not gonna see your legs.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.
penny Add a belt and I’ll take you some place nice.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Done and done.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I think I’ve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.
sheldon_cooper Very impressive. You know, when you’re done with that, can you look at this? It doesn’t make smoke anymore.
howard_wolowitz One toy at a time.
sheldon_cooper Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it’s for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.
raj_koothrappali What’s the first one?
howard_wolowitz Suicide.
sheldon_cooper Wrong. Obesity.
bernadette_rostenkowski I have the tool you wanted.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
raj_koothrappali You guys don’t have to go to the trouble. I’m back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.
howard_wolowitz It’s not about the money. It’s about solving a problem. It’s why I became an engineer. It’s what I like to do, it’s what I’m trained to do. It’s who I am.
sheldon_cooper Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you just call tech support?
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Whoa.
raj_koothrappali Not cool.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.
bernadette_rostenkowski I call tech support all the time.
howard_wolowitz Ha-ha.
sheldon_cooper You call tech support.
raj_koothrappali What a baby.
headmaster#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode22 And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Members of the faculty, students, I’m excited to speak to you today. I can’t help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I’d also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancée for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.
penny Oh. Hello. I, I didn’t know he was gonna point it at me, so, don’t do drugs and stay in school.
leonard_hofstadter They’re graduating.
penny Okay, bye.
howard_wolowitz All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we’re back in business. Let’s just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?
sheldon_cooper Check.
howard_wolowitz GPS?
raj_koothrappali Check.
howard_wolowitz Battery charged?
sheldon_cooper Check.
bernadette_rostenkowski Four hours of our lives gone? Check.
howard_wolowitz All right. All systems go. In five…
announcer Four, three, two, one.
sheldon_cooper That’s what my train used to do.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ready to call tech support?
howard_wolowitz Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who’s reading from the same manual I have.
raj_koothrappali It’s my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.
dr_vm_koothrappali What did you say to your mother?
raj_koothrappali Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she’s doing okay.
dr_vm_koothrappali Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I’m some sort of playboy.
raj_koothrappali Really? I don’t know where she’d get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I’m so lucky I take after you.
dr_vm_koothrappali You think you take after me?
raj_koothrappali Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn’t be a scientist if you hadn’t been my role model. Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?
leonard_hofstadter It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I’m boring myself. Sorry, I can’t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school’s great if you look like this, but I didn’t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you’re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you’re graduating and you still haven’t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don’t have any friends. And guess what? That’s okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don’t know what they were doing ’cause I was never there.
penny I’ll, I’ll tell you later.
leonard_hofstadter My point is, while you’re spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you’re really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they’re gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it’s over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.
tech_support Your call is important to us. All our technicians are busy helping other customers. Please stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly.
howard_wolowitz What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, I’ll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.
sheldon_cooper It is awful, isn’t it? Listen to that noise.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, hang on. It’s working. I did it.
raj_koothrappali How’d you do that?
howard_wolowitz No idea, but I did it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you shouldn’t be flying it inside.
howard_wolowitz Well, I’m not flying it.
sheldon_cooper Then who is?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.
sheldon_cooper Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the camera’s working. Oh, look, it’s me.
tech_support_recording Tech Support, can I help you?
sheldon_cooper Yes, it’s a robot uprising. Call the police.
leonard_hofstadter So you really think they liked it?
penny Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech I…
sheldon_cooper Don’t worry, everyone in here is safe.
