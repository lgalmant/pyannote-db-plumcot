raj_koothrappali You’re wrong.
howard_wolowitz No, I’m not.
raj_koothrappali Yes, you are.
howard_wolowitz No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?
leonard_hofstadter Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.
raj_koothrappali The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.
howard_wolowitz Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
sheldon_cooper I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass.
sheldon_cooper You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
leonard_hofstadter Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
sheldon_cooper Agreed.
leonard_hofstadter I was gonna say or, but why bother?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Hey, I got you a little gift.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.
raj_koothrappali You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?
howard_wolowitz Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.
raj_koothrappali Wow, so you’re not curious at all?
howard_wolowitz Nope.
raj_koothrappali Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.
wil_wheaton Thanks again for agreeing to do this.
penny Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
penny Those are Star Trek people.
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
penny I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.
wil_wheaton I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.
penny Sorry.
wil_wheaton Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we’re gonna take some calls, we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.
leonard_hofstadter This is exciting.
penny Yeah, so, how many people listen?
wil_wheaton Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.
penny What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
wil_wheaton Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.
amy_farrah_fowler Can you please pass the salt?
sheldon_cooper Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
amy_farrah_fowler Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?
amy_farrah_fowler No, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.
amy_farrah_fowler According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
sheldon_cooper You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it applies to you, too.
sheldon_cooper I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.
raj_koothrappali So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.
raj_koothrappali You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball.
howard_wolowitz Can I help you?
guy_at_door#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.
howard_wolowitz Wuh, uh, who’s your father?
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 Sam Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Sam Wolowitz is my father.
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 I know.
howard_wolowitz Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?
guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 I think so.
howard_wolowitz Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.
wil_wheaton Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.
leonard_hofstadter Psst.
wil_wheaton I’ve just been handed a note. I’m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.
leonard_hofstadter I, I didn’t want to interrupt.
wil_wheaton Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny’s fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don’t you grab some headphones and join us?
leonard_hofstadter Really?
wil_wheaton Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, great.
wil_wheaton So, while Leonard gets set up, let’s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.
caller I don’t have a question. I just want to say I’m a big fan of the movie. I’ve seen it, like, ten times.
penny Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.
wil_wheaton Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.
penny Really?
wil_wheaton Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.
wil_wheaton All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.
kevin_smith Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me.
penny Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.
leonard_hofstadter It really is.
kevin_smith Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.
penny Oh, wow. I wish it was better.
wil_wheaton Oh, don’t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin’s films?
kevin_smith You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.
penny Aw.
wil_wheaton You know, I’m in the movie, too.
kevin_smith Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute.
penny Seriously?
kevin_smith Oh, yeah, man. I’m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I’ve ever done before. It’s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.
penny Oh, my, I would love that.
leonard_hofstadter You have a new job.
penny Well, maybe I can do both.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think you can do both.
penny I don’t think I asked you.
kevin_smith Yeah, you tell him, Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.
sheldon_cooper Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
amy_farrah_fowler Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
sheldon_cooper You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.
amy_farrah_fowler Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
sheldon_cooper Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself.
amy_farrah_fowler When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
sheldon_cooper I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.
amy_farrah_fowler And at the same time, not.
sheldon_cooper It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.
sheldon_cooper Isn’t that a little juvenile?
amy_farrah_fowler More juvenile than this?
sheldon_cooper I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
howard_wolowitz You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, let me do it, Howard.
howard_wolowitz No, I got it.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, Josh, what do you do?
josh_wolowitz I’m studying oceanography down in San Diego.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.
raj_koothrappali Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
josh_wolowitz Why would I lie?
raj_koothrappali Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?
josh_wolowitz No.
raj_koothrappali A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?
josh_wolowitz No.
raj_koothrappali You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you help with the coffee?
raj_koothrappali Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?
howard_wolowitz Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?
raj_koothrappali I get it. What do you want to do?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this.
raj_koothrappali All right, I’ve got your back.
howard_wolowitz Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.
josh_wolowitz I can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut. That’s amazing. What was it like?
raj_koothrappali Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road.
howard_wolowitz Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.
wil_wheaton So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star…
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.
wil_wheaton All right. We’re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn’t believe women should have dreams.
leonard_hofstadter Give me back that juice.
penny What is the harm if I audition?
leonard_hofstadter Well, what if you get it?
penny I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.
leonard_hofstadter From a Kevin Smith movie?
kevin_smith Oh, I’m hanging up now.
wil_wheaton Don’t you listen to him, buddy. You’re awesome. You’re one of the greatest directors of our time.
kevin_smith I don’t have a part for you, Wheaton.
wil_wheaton And that was Kevin Smith.
penny Thanks a lot.
leonard_hofstadter I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
penny Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?
leonard_hofstadter I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
penny Decent? I make twice what you make.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, twice?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Like, times two twice?
wil_wheaton For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let’s listen.
leonard_hofstadter I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
penny Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
leonard_hofstadter Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
wil_wheaton For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.
amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
amy_farrah_fowler Can I come in?
sheldon_cooper Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.
amy_farrah_fowler Amazing.
sheldon_cooper I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.
amy_farrah_fowler What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.
sheldon_cooper Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
howard_wolowitz I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
josh_wolowitz Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?
josh_wolowitz Sorry, I have a long drive.
howard_wolowitz Well, I hope I get to see you again.
josh_wolowitz I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.
bernadette_rostenkowski Keep dreaming.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.
josh_wolowitz Wow.
bernadette_rostenkowski He did it with a robot.
josh_wolowitz You had sex with a robot?
howard_wolowitz That’s not what she meant.
raj_koothrappali But technically, yes.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?
penny In a safe place.
leonard_hofstadter What does that mean, under your bed?
penny No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute, you have a guy?
penny Don’t you have a guy?
leonard_hofstadter Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
penny Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.
wil_wheaton For those of you listening at home, how great is this?
leonard_hofstadter Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.
wil_wheaton Sure. And we’re back.
penny Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.
leonard_hofstadter Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.
penny Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?
leonard_hofstadter That would be great, thank you.
wil_wheaton I’m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you’re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, it is, Wil.
josh_wolowitz So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?
howard_wolowitz It was actually just a mechanical hand.
josh_wolowitz ‘Cause that’s all you need, right?
howard_wolowitz You are my brother.
sheldon_cooper Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.
amy_farrah_fowler I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold.
sheldon_cooper Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.
sheldon_cooper Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner.
amy_farrah_fowler We both know this one’s gonna win.
sheldon_cooper Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, I’ll help you take this down.
sheldon_cooper Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.
sheldon_cooper That’s a big step.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s a big fort.
sheldon_cooper Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.
amy_farrah_fowler PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
sheldon_cooper G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.
amy_farrah_fowler You got yourself a sleepover.
sheldon_cooper Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
amy_farrah_fowler Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
sheldon_cooper It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?
amy_farrah_fowler Who says this is the only one I hid?
leonard_hofstadter Hello? What is this?
sheldon_cooper We built a fort.
leonard_hofstadter Are those my sheets?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, they are.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.
sheldon_cooper Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m good.
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
sheldon_cooper I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, have a seat on the floor.
sheldon_cooper Not there. That’s my spot.
