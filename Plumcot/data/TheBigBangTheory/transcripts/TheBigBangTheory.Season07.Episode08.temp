penny Hey, can I ask you a question?
leonard Sure.
penny You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but I’ve never seen you play.
leonard Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.
penny What window?
leonard That one over there.
sheldon Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?
leonard Skee-Ball tickets?
sheldon Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.
leonard Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box.
penny Ooh, what are you gonna get?
sheldon None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.
leonard Yup, oh, here you go.
sheldon Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.
leonard Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.
penny Aw, did she hate you?
leonard Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.
sheldon I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
leonard Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there.
sheldon Well, you barely looked. Let me see.
leonard No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.
sheldon Leonard, let me look in the box.
leonard Okay, okay. I’m gonna show you what’s in the box. But just promise not to flip out.
sheldon Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It’s a spider.
penny No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out.
leonard Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?
sheldon That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?
leonard I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it.
sheldon Okay.
leonard I mean it, I’m going to.
sheldon I believe you.
leonard And you’re going to stay calm?
sheldon I said I would.
leonard How about that? Sheldon’s being reasonable.
penny Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.
leonard So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.
sheldon Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.
leonard When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
sheldon You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
leonard Well, I don’t know how to do that.
sheldon How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.
leonard That’s stupid. Why?
sheldon You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way.
leonard I’m telling you, try the hanger.
sheldon Put it on. Let’s share the experience.
leonard You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.
sheldon Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.
leonard Really?
sheldon How those nipples feeling, chief?
bernadette Penny, can we please get our drinks?
penny Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.
amy At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.
bernadette Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.
penny I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ’cause my manager saw me put it there.
amy Oh, my gosh. That’s the girl that broke Rajesh’s heart.
bernadette That’s Lucy?
penny I don’t know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
bernadette I think that reason’s called racism.
penny I’m gonna go talk to her.
bernadette Why? What are you gonna say?
penny I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who’s racist now?
bernadette You because you just called him your Indian friend.
penny Yeah, well, you’re short.
amy We’re never getting our drinks.
bernadette No, but we knew that.
penny Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?
lucy Oh, water would be great.
penny Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.
lucy Wow. How’s he doing?
penny Oh, you know, he’s good.
lucy Great.
penny Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?
lucy Oh, I don’t know. I guess I thought it would be easier.
penny Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.
lucy Any chance I can get a different waitress?
penny I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?
lucy I don’t know your e-mail.
penny You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here, perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess.
lucy Oh, I thought you said he was okay.
penny Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?
howard So, you can never take it off?
leonard No.
raj Not even to sleep?
leonard No.
howard So, you’re just an idiot?
leonard It’s called proving a point.
howard Is the point that you’re an idiot?
sheldon Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can’t walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.
raj So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?
leonard Monday morning I’ll go downtown, look up the owner’s information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!
howard And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
raj I don’t get it.
howard You didn’t have Smokey the Bear in India?
raj No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.
howard You had to be taught not to play with cobras?
raj You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
penny Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?
bernadette We did, you never brought it.
penny Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.
amy Not even close.
penny Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.
amy You want to say sorry.
bernadette So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?
penny What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?
amy You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.
bernadette Then you made her cry and leave.
penny Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.
raj What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.
howard Hey, what’re you working on?
sheldon I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
howard That’s a pretty cool idea.
sheldon Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.
howard Sure.
sheldon This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?
leonard Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.
howard You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin.
leonard Or it’s resolved.
sheldon Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.
howard I believe this is yours.
raj Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?
howard You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.
raj Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?
bernadette If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?
howard Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.
raj He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.
bernadette Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.
raj Well, can I say she looks nice?
bernadette Sure.
raj Can I tell her I miss her?
bernadette Maybe, if she asks.
raj Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?
bernadette I’d save that for the second date.
raj Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.
penny What are you doing?
leonard Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.
penny Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?
leonard There’s a principle at stake.
penny Which is?
leonard Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.
penny Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell.
leonard No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.
penny Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.
leonard No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.
penny Smile.
leonard What is that? What is that for?
penny So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
amy I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.
sheldon I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
amy Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?
sheldon The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?
amy I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?
sheldon There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.
amy Seriously?
sheldon Please. Ha-ha, Oh.
lucy Hi.
raj Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you.
lucy You, too.
raj Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?
lucy I’m pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.
raj Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.
lucy Okay.
raj I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.
lucy Oh, uh, I’m kind of seeing someone.
raj I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?
raj This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?
penny There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
raj I love you, Penny.
sheldon How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
amy I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?
sheldon There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
leonard Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.
sheldon Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?
leonard Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?
sheldon Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.
leonard Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.
sheldon You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.
leonard Why isn’t this bothering you? Isn’t your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn’t this making you crazy?
sheldon Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.
leonard What?
sheldon Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.
leonard What?
sheldon I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.
leonard Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!
amy Sheldon, that was diabolical.
sheldon I know. And it wasn’t easy. Do you have any idea what it’s like to wait for years and never know if you’re going to finally get satisfaction?
raj Wow. You’re even prettier than Penny said. I can’t believe a girl like you doesn’t have a boyfriend.
girl Well, I don’t.
raj I don’t believe you, you’re lying to me.
girl What?
raj Oh, it’s okay. I have no morals and I’m desperately lonely. I’ll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.
girl What is wrong with you?
penny What is wrong with you?
raj What is wrong with you?
