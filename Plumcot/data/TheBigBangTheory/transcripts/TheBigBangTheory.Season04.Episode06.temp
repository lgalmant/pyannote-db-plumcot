howard Gagh!
leonard Problem?
howard This is the worst cobbler I’ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
sheldon Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
raj Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
sheldon Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.
priya Oh, Sheldon. You haven’t changed a bit, have you?
sheldon Why would I change?
leonard The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?
priya I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.
raj Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
sheldon Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible.
leonard And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
priya I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.
leonard I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is.
raj Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
sheldon Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs.
raj I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
howard Hey, I’ve got a girlfriend now.
raj Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
howard Let’s just agree they’re both hot.
raj Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about.
howard Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.
raj Did you pinky swear?
howard Yes.
raj Okay then.
sheldon Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
priya It’s really nice to see you again Leonard.
leonard Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
priya Thanks.
leonard Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Okay.
howard So, you got any special plans with your sister?
raj Oh, not really, just hang out.
sheldon I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.
raj Train day?
sheldon The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
raj I don’t think we’re going to do that.
sheldon Well then apparently, you hate fun.
leonard Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?
raj Uh, my plans with Priya.
sheldon He rejected train day.
leonard Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
sheldon Abundantly.
leonard I guess he just hates fun.
sheldon That’s what I said.
priya Okay, so, what’s new with you guys.
howard I have a girlfriend now.
priya Hey, good for you.
howard Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? .
leonard So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here.
priya I don’t know, I just have the one day.
sheldon Do you like trains?
priya Not particularly.
sheldon You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
sheldon You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.
leonard It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?
sheldon I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
leonard That’s pretty cool.
sheldon Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.
leonard You’ve really got to get out more.
sheldon Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.
priya Raj finally went to bed.
leonard Yeah, well, Sheldon’s still up.
priya You said he goes to bed at nine.
leonard Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
sheldon Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.
priya Can’t you get rid of him?
leonard If the past is any indication, no.
sheldon Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.
leonard Drop axe.
sheldon Drop axe. Brilliant.
leonard Give me a minute. Sheldon,
sheldon Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
leonard Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
sheldon I know.
leonard Well then, bed mister.
sheldon Five more minutes.
leonard Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
sheldon Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
leonard You don’t want that, do you?
sheldon No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
leonard Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
sheldon That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
leonard No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work.
sheldon Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak.
leonard Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!
sheldon I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
leonard We’re going to have to be very quiet.
sheldon I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.
leonard No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
sheldon Yes.
leonard You’re right, you’re lost, good luck.
priya Oh! Leonard, wake up.
leonard Huh! Sorry!
priya For what?
leonard I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response.
priya It’s six o’ clock, I have to get back to Raj’s before he wakes up and realises I’m gone.
leonard Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
priya Mmm. Me too.
leonard You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.
priya Where are you going with this, Leonard?
leonard Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.
priya Leonard, didn’t we have this conversation five years ago.
leonard Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.
priya Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn’t mean I want to have a serious relationship.
leonard It doesn’t?
priya Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They’d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.
leonard I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
priya Aha, you’re funny.
sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard What?
sheldon I heard a woman laughing.
leonard Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
sheldon Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
leonard Air freshener.
sheldon And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
leonard Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash.
sheldon My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
leonard Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
sheldon Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
leonard Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go.
sheldon Do you prefer ointment or cream?
leonard Uh, cream.
sheldon With or without a numbing agent?
leonard Without.
sheldon Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.
leonard Fine. With.
sheldon Prescription or non-prescription strength.
leonard Use your best judgement.
sheldon Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
leonard Sounds great.
sheldon Excellent choice.
leonard Right, right, alright.
sheldon Priya?
priya Good morning, Sheldon.
sheldon For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
leonard Making pretty good time, huh?
sheldon Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?
leonard No.
sheldon What do you want to talk about?
leonard Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
sheldon There it is. What if someone asks?
leonard No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
sheldon Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
leonard Like what?
sheldon Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?
leonard Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
sheldon In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.
leonard What are you talking about?
sheldon April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
leonard Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.
sheldon And Raj.
leonard Alright, and Raj.
sheldon And me.
leonard You?
sheldon Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.
leonard Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
sheldon You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
leonard My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
sheldon You mean, you want me to keep a secret.
leonard Yes.
sheldon You know I can’t keep a secret.
leonard You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?
sheldon Why do you get to be Batman?
leonard Because, well, Batman has the secret.
sheldon Well Alfred has secrets too.
leonard Like what?
sheldon Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret.
sheldon Ta-da!
leonard What.
sheldon Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
leonard Kind of busy here, Sheldon.
sheldon I know, that’s why I shortened it.
leonard What do you want.
sheldon I came to go over your alibi for last night.
leonard What alibi?
sheldon You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.
leonard Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?
sheldon The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.
leonard Oh, God.
sheldon You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.
leonard Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.
sheldon And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
mechanical_voice_on_sheldons_phone Top of the morning to you. You’ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.
sheldon It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.
leonard Where did you get that?
sheldon From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
leonard An orang-u-tan?
sheldon Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.
leonard Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.
leonard Hey.
raj Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
leonard C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
sheldon And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.
raj Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
leonard I didn’t see it.
howard Didn’t see it? What were you doing?
leonard Uh, I was out.
raj On Caprica night?
leonard Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.
howard Really, you, and where, where did you go?
leonard To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s.
sheldon Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole.
leonard Yes.
sheldon Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?
leonard As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
sheldon Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable.
leonard Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
sheldon Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.
raj What were you doing with Priya?
sheldon I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?
raj What? You slept with my sister?
leonard Yeah.
howard How could you? We had a pact!
raj Excuse me, I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
sheldon May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.
leonard Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
raj I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
leonard No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
raj How hard did she stomp?
leonard Very hard.
raj Okay, I’m good.
howard Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.
leonard Really?
howard Mmm.
leonard Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
raj Dude! I put that thing on my face!
sheldon I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
howard Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.
raj That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
howard And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food.
sheldon Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.
leonard You put moths in my food?
sheldon For science.
raj I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
leonard Well, uh, I can’t believe.
