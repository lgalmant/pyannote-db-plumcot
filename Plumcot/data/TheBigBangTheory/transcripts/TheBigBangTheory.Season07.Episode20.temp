leonard I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.
raj I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
howard Only without the sex.
raj Yeah, literally, none of it.
leonard What do you think about it, Sheldon?
sheldon Meh.
raj Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
sheldon Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
leonard Oh, my God, you’re jealous.
sheldon Why would I be jealous?
leonard Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.
sheldon Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.
barry Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.
sheldon Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
barry No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.
sheldon Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.
barry Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.
sheldon Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
howard Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
penny Hey, you’re up early.
sheldon I couldn’t sleep.
penny I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
sheldon No, that’s not it.
penny Is something bothering you?
sheldon Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.
penny Oh, come on, try me.
sheldon All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.
penny Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
sheldon You mean your acting career?
penny No.
sheldon Your relationship with Leonard?
penny No.
sheldon Your failed attempt to go back to college?
penny No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.
sheldon I said Leonard, you said no.
penny I’m talking about other guys.
sheldon Okay. Well, what do you do?
penny You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
sheldon I don’t know if I can do that.
penny I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.
leonard Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?
sheldon Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
leonard Hey, how’s dating two women going?
raj Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
howard And?
raj She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you
leonard Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?
raj At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
howard I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
raj Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
howard She is. But I like that attitude.
sheldon Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
raj You’re really going to do this?
sheldon I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.
howard You’re reading Cosmo?
sheldon Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.
howard What’s this?
sheldon Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
leonard Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
sheldon It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.
raj It’s going to be okay.
sheldon I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.
howard So, you and Emily still together?
howard I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.
raj Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
howard Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?
raj She’s very real.
howard Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.
raj See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
howard I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.
raj You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
howard You got it.
raj No jokes about the year I took ballet.
howard You took ballet?
raj God, you never listen.
leonard Are you sure you want to do this?
sheldon The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
leonard What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
sheldon You stop it.
penny So, how do you want me to cut it?
sheldon Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?
leonard So, business in the front, science in the back.
penny Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
sheldon Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.
penny Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
leonard That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?
sheldon Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.
penny Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.
sheldon Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.
penny Okay, what do you think?
sheldon Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
leonard It actually looks good, Sheldon.
penny Doesn’t it?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.
amy Sorry I’m late. What did you do?
penny I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?
amy Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.
sheldon She’s right. I’m too hot.
bernadette I’m excited to meet Emily.
howard Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.
bernadette Why would you say that?
howard Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.
bernadette How?
howard In a bad way, very bad.
raj Hey, guys.
howard Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.
raj Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.
emily Nice to meet you.
bernadette Hi.
emily Have we met before?
howard Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.
emily You sure? You look familiar.
howard Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.
emily Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?
howard That must be it.
raj Since when do you go to spin class?
howard Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?
amy Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?
sheldon Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?
penny Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
sheldon Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
sheldon Have you considered studying standard model physics?
sheldon You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?
penny Like you could get a brown bear.
leonard Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.
amy Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
sheldon Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.
leonard What about loop quantum gravity?
sheldon Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.
penny Who’s the duchess?
leonard One of the people that lives in his head.
amy I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
leonard Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.
penny Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
sheldon That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.
amy How does that happen?
sheldon A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
penny Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
sheldon Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?
penny And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
bernadette Emily, what do you do?
emily I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.
raj Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.
emily This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.
raj Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.
emily Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?
howard It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…
emily Oh, my God, I remember.
howard Can I finish my astronaut story?
emily It was four years ago.
howard Please don’t say it.
emily We were set up on a blind date.
howard Please don’t say it.
emily You came to my apartment.
howard You’re saying it.
raj Wh, what happened?
bernadette Yeah, what happened?
howard Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.
bernadette Please don’t say it.
howard One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.
emily You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.
howard I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.
emily Right, just water.
howard Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.
emily It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.
raj Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
howard Yeah, yeah, I get it.
bernadette Howie.
howard Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.
amy Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.
sheldon No more than Penny.
amy That’s what I’m saying.
sheldon Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Empty room. Empty room. Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.
bernadette So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?
emily I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.
bernadette You’re kidding, right?
raj She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.
howard Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.
bernadette Howie, we moved on a long time ago.
howard I’m just saying…
bernadette We moved on.
howard Okay. Fine.
bernadette How’s your soup?
howard Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.
bernadette Where are you going?
howard I need some fresh air.
emily Been there.
sheldon Oh, no. What have I done?
leonard How you feeling?
sheldon Not so good.
leonard Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
sheldon It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.
leonard I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?
leonard After she put you to bed, she went home.
sheldon Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.
leonard What?
sheldon Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.
answerphone First new message.
sheldon Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
howard You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?
sheldon Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
howard Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
sheldon I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
howard I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
sheldon Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?
howard Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
sheldon Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.
barry Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.
howard Get out of here, Barry.
barry Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.
sheldon Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.
answerphone Next message.
sheldon It’s me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together.
answerphone Next message.
sheldon Do you know what’s great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That’s fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.
answerphone Next message.
sheldon Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.
answerphone Next message.
sheldon Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. I’m you. Get it?

sheldon Are you mad at me? Oh, no, you’re mad at me. I’m so sorry. Beep bop boop bop.
answerphone Next message.
sheldon Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That’s even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?
stephen_hawking What a jackass.
