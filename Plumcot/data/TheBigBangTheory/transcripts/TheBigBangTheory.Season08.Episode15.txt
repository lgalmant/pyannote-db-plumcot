sheldon_cooper I’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
sheldon_cooper How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
amy_farrah_fowler How many?
sheldon_cooper Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
amy_farrah_fowler Is that really true?
sheldon_cooper Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.
barry_kripke Hey, sowwy to intewupt.
sheldon_cooper Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
barry_kripke Did you know Edison didn’t actuawy invent the wight bulb?
sheldon_cooper What do you want, Barry?
barry_kripke Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s this for?
barry_kripke Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper’s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s fascinating. I can’t wait to read it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.
barry_kripke Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.
sheldon_cooper Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal.
sheldon_cooper Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?
amy_farrah_fowler I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.
sheldon_cooper That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we’re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You’re being petty.
sheldon_cooper I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?
howard_wolowitz Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.
bernadette_rostenkowski Your mom having fun in Florida?
howard_wolowitz Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s just being nice.
howard_wolowitz Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because you have a wife.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know you don’t like Stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, I’m sure he’ll get back on his feet.
howard_wolowitz That would be great. I’d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure.
penny Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny You okay?
sheldon_cooper If I was okay, I would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.
penny What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper I’m mad at Amy.
penny Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?
sheldon_cooper No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
penny Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
sheldon_cooper Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that.
penny I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.
sheldon_cooper Why would she do this to me?
penny Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?
sheldon_cooper No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science.
penny All right, well, if I’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I’m thinking you might have to let this one go.
sheldon_cooper Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel.
penny I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, why don’t you talk to her?
sheldon_cooper Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?
penny Well, you could shove them somewhere.
sheldon_cooper Okay, now you’re getting creative.
stuart_bloom Thanks again for your help.
leonard_hofstadter No problem.
raj_koothrappali Our pleasure.
leonard_hofstadter The place really looks great.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.
stuart_bloom I keep telling you I didn’t burn it down.
leonard_hofstadter We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.
bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, this place looks amazing.
stuart_bloom Thanks.
howard_wolowitz You really did a nice job.
stuart_bloom And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom’s through all this. I couldn’t have done it otherwise.
howard_wolowitz I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?
stuart_bloom Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn’t it look great?
howard_wolowitz Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
stuart_bloom What is your problem? She said it was okay.
howard_wolowitz Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay.
stuart_bloom Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.
howard_wolowitz Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t we leave so you can cool off?
stuart_bloom I think that’s a good idea. Take him out of my store.
howard_wolowitz Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I’m not going anywhere.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we go get the food for the party.
stuart_bloom Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Smart, looks like we’re being helpful.
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.
sheldon_cooper Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?
penny I don’t know, just think about something else.
sheldon_cooper Can I think about the spiny anteater?
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.
penny You know, some people try visualization.
sheldon_cooper How does that work?
penny Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
penny Now imagine you’re holding that pen.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
penny Now open your hand and let it go.
sheldon_cooper But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.
penny Sheldon, this isn’t that hard.
sheldon_cooper I may have a better way that you can teach me.
penny How?
sheldon_cooper What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
penny What? She didn’t give me any puzzles.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure?
amy_farrah_fowler Boy, I just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?
amy_farrah_fowler Darn it. There’s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?
amy_farrah_fowler Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.
penny Son of a bitch.
sheldon_cooper Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go.
penny I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
sheldon_cooper Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.
penny Why would she even do this?
sheldon_cooper She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?
penny Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
sheldon_cooper No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?
penny It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting.
sheldon_cooper Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard.
penny Oh, my, that’s it. Get out.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.
penny Get out.
sheldon_cooper Penny?
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I think I left my pen in there.
bernadette_rostenkowski I understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it’s just furniture.
howard_wolowitz It’s my mom’s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.
howard_wolowitz That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.
waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 Sure, let me go check on that.
raj_koothrappali Dude, I, I think that’s Nathan Fillion.
leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah, look at that.
raj_koothrappali And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
raj_koothrappali No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing.
leonard_hofstadter That would be great.
raj_koothrappali So should we go talk to him?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.
raj_koothrappali What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.
leonard_hofstadter He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
raj_koothrappali I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.
nathan_fillion Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I’m not an actor.
raj_koothrappali Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great.
nathan_fillion Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I’m Nathan Fillion, but I’m not. So if you don’t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.
leonard_hofstadter Come on. Sorry to bother you.
raj_koothrappali Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I’m still floating.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it’s me.
penny Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you talking about?
penny I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, open the door.
sheldon_cooper I can’t. I’m naked.
amy_farrah_fowler I just saw you.
sheldon_cooper Hang on.
penny Open the door now.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hey.
penny Pull up your pants.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.
penny I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.
amy_farrah_fowler So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry again.
nathan_fillion No problem.
raj_koothrappali Are you sure you’re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We’re scientists, not crazy fanboys.
nathan_fillion All right, fine. I’m him.
raj_koothrappali And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him.
nathan_fillion I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let’s take a picture.
leonard_hofstadter That would be great.
raj_koothrappali Great.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, thank you.
nathan_fillion You bet.
raj_koothrappali Wait, hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion, what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?
nathan_fillion I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it, that’s the line.
raj_koothrappali Although, I knew the line, doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion.
nathan_fillion Do you want the picture or not?
raj_koothrappali I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
nathan_fillion How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?
leonard_hofstadter What do you think?
raj_koothrappali Ah, it’s good enough for Facebook.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe they did that.
penny I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.
penny Unbelievable.
leonard_hofstadter And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.
penny Really? You couldn’t get it out?
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Wow, the store looks great.
leonard_hofstadter So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?
penny Eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s not true.
sheldon_cooper That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Can you please just let it go?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.
howard_wolowitz Hold that thought. Hello?
amy_farrah_fowler How can I make this up to you?
penny The answer’s in this puzzle box. Let’s see if you can open it.
stuart_bloom You could have at least warned him about the furniture.
raj_koothrappali That’s what I said when we moved it.
bernadette_rostenkowski You helped him?
raj_koothrappali No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you okay?
howard_wolowitz No.
leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong?
howard_wolowitz My mom died.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, Howie.
leonard_hofstadter I’m so sorry.
raj_koothrappali What can we do?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper May I say something?
leonard_hofstadter Not right now, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper But I think it would be comforting.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy.
howard_wolowitz No, it’s okay. What?
sheldon_cooper When I lost my own father, I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do.
penny I really thought he was gonna say let it go.
raj_koothrappali Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they’ve booked a flight. They’re heading to the airport now.
penny How’s Howard holding up?
raj_koothrappali He’s hanging in there.
leonard_hofstadter How are you doing, Stuart?
stuart_bloom Still can’t believe she’s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn’t for her, I, I would have been homeless.
amy_farrah_fowler One of us would have taken you in.
stuart_bloom Yeah, I don’t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I’m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.
penny Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.
amy_farrah_fowler She did that to me, too.
penny Don’t take this away from me.
sheldon_cooper I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again, I’m sad.
leonard_hofstadter If you want, I can yell at you later.
sheldon_cooper It won’t be as good.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.
