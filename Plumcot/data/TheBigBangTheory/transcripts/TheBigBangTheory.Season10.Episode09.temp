bert Thank you very much. Thanks.
leonard That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
howard Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.
raj Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
sheldon Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
leonard That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too.
howard Ah.
sheldon Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.
leonard How much money did he win?
raj Over half a million dollars.
leonard Wow.
howard And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.
sheldon Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.
howard Here he comes.
leonard Right. Be polite.
sheldon I know how to behave.
howard Do you?
raj Hey, congratulations Bert.
leonard Yeah, good for you.
howard That’s amazing.
bert Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
sheldon Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.
bert I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.
sheldon Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice.
leonard I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.
sheldon Well, aren’t you a peach.
sheldon Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it.
leonard Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.
penny Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
sheldon Who listens to the radio any more?
amy Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
leonard They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
penny You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?
sheldon You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.
amy You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning.
sheldon You want me to read a geology paper?
amy Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy.
howard You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
bernadette Who is it?
howard Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.
bernadette Where did you get that?
howard I found him in an old box.
bernadette Why would you buy it?
howard I didn’t buy it. I made it.
bernadette Last question. What is wrong with you?
howard What’s the big deal?
bernadette Howie, it’s in poor taste.
howard No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.
remotecontrol_hawking Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?
howard His eyes also light up in the dark.
leonard It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
penny It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
sheldon Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why.
amy Sounds like the night we had coitus.
sheldon I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.
amy Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit.
sheldon Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?
penny Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?
leonard What are you doing?
penny I, I knew the answer. I got excited.
leonard Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.
sheldon That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.
leonard Hey, I’m trying to help you.
sheldon Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
leonard You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…
howard Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it.
raj This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.
howard You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it.
bernadette Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.
howard I have no problem calling him.
bernadette Fine, then do it.
howard Fine, I will.
bernadette While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.
raj What’s this button do?
remotecontrol_hawking Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.
howard You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
raj I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
sheldon I admire you, Leonard.
leonard Really, why?
sheldon You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.
leonard I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head.
sheldon How did you deal with it?
leonard I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix.
sheldon I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock.
leonard Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.
sheldon Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
leonard Let it fly.
sheldon Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…
amy What happened?
sheldon I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
leonard Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
penny Well, and what happened to you?
leonard Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.
amy You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop.
leonard Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.
amy You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head.
sheldon Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you.
amy Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
leonard You’re up.
penny This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.
sheldon Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?
penny I do, your life is fine you big baby.
sheldon Maybe you’re right.
amy Really?
leonard If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too.
sheldon Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.
penny There you go.
sheldon And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
penny There you go.
amy What’s up?
howard I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
amy Yep.
howard Do you think this is in poor taste?
leonard Does it spin around and do tricks?
howard Yeah
leonard Then yeah.
howard What do you think?
barry That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom.
howard All right, we’re done. It’s offensive.
sheldon Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.
howard You’re in a good mood.
sheldon Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.
leonard Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?
raj Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward.
sheldon Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.
howard What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
leonard I think he might be learning on his own.
raj Then the robot uprising has begun.
sheldon Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.
raj He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.
sheldon Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.
bert Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great.
sheldon Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.
bert You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year.
sheldon Really? I didn’t know that.
bert So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?
sheldon You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me. Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.
leonard Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.
amy I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
sheldon No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.
bernadette I can’t imagine you being violent.
leonard It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.
sheldon I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
raj It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
amy What about me and Sheldon?
raj Sure.
leonard I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.
raj Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.
amy Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks.
penny Aw, thank you.
amy That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
penny What?
amy You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.
penny You liked my short hair, right?
leonard Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.
penny Seriously, none of you liked it?
bernadette I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
penny You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?
bernadette I think he looks cute.
howard And I think you’re cute.
raj I think you’re both cute.
penny I think I hate all of you nerds.
sheldon Sorry I’m moving slowly.
leonard Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.
sheldon Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.
leonard Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
sheldon I can’t take this any more. Bert. Bert. Bert.
bert Come in.
sheldon All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk.
bert What happened to you?
sheldon Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.
bert Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for.
sheldon I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.
bert Is it working?
sheldon No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.
bert Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.
sheldon We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go.
bert Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?
sheldon You know what? This isn’t gonna work.
bert Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.
sheldon Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?
bert It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better.
penny I can’t believe you punched Bert.
sheldon I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.
leonard Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better.
stephen_hawking Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon Professor Hawking.
hawking I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy.
sheldon Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.
hawking Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.
penny Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair.
hawking It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons.
sheldon How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
hawking I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.
leonard Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care.
hawking Don’t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you’re too brilliant.
amy How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?
sheldon I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
hawking I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.
sheldon What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?
leonard Do not tell Wolowitz.
amy Way ahead of you.
ellen A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that’s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they’re dumb.
sheldon Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.
