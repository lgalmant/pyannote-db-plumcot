sheldon Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down.
leonard Okay, I have pokh.
all Have it. Got it.
leonard Potl.
all Yup. Have it. Have it.
leonard Pukhpa.
all Have it. Got it. Yup.
howard I have Chorrr.
raj_sheldon Got it. Yup.
howard Nekhmakh.
raj_sheldon Yeah. Yeah.
howard And Kreplach.
raj Hold on a second. Kreplach?
howard Yeah.
raj That isn’t Klingon, it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.
howard Well, as it turns out, it’s also a Klingon word.
leonard Really? Define it.
howard Kreplach, A hearty Klingon… dumpling.
raj Judge’s ruling?
sheldon Bilurrrbe.
penny Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
sheldon What’s wrong with your TV?
penny I don’t know, it just died, I’m getting a bunch of static.
howard Did you pay your cable bill?
sheldon Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…
leonard No,no, don’t tell her.
sheldon …playing Klingon Boggle.
leonard Aw!
howard What do you mean, aw? Like she didn’t know we were nerds?
sheldon All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.
penny Fine.
sheldon All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!
howard Look at those women.
leonard They’re gorgeous.
sheldon Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun.
howard Oh, look, the’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz.
leonard Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
sheldon Is qochbe’ spelled with a or a ?
howard Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
penny Oh. That’s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.
howard House? What house?
penny They all live in a house together.
howard A house, where?
penny I don’t know. Somewhere in L.A.
howard Wait a minute, you’re telling me that I’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?
penny Yeah, I guess.
howard And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
leonard Hey, wh-where are you going?
penny To pay my cable bill.
sheldon All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?
leonard Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
raj Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
howard Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.
leonard Sheldon, the food’s here.
raj There’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.
leonard What are you doing?
raj Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
leonard Why?
howard Isn’t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.
sheldon Is my hamburger medium well?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Dill slices, not sweet?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Individual relish packets?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Onion rings?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Extra breading?
leonard I asked.
sheldon What did they say?
leonard No.
sheldon Did you protest?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Vociferously?
leonard No.
sheldon Well, then what took you so long?
leonard Just eat.
penny Hey, guys, what’d I miss? What’d I miss?
howard Giselle’s hanging by a thread.
penny Oh, good, I hate her.
howard Then you’re not invited to our wedding.
leonard Here you go.
penny Thank you.
sheldon Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
all Yes.
sheldon You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
leonard Put it on the agenda.
sheldon But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
leonard Oh, I’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it.
sheldon Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
penny Oh, Giselle’s not getting kicked off. It’s totally going to be Summer. What?
leonard Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!
penny It’s one onion ring.
howard Just put it back before he comes!
leonard No, no, no, no, I don’t think that’s where it was.
howard Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
sheldon Who touched my…
all Penny! Penny did it.
sheldon Why would you do that?
penny I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?
sheldon The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
penny All right. Look, I didn’t know, I’m sorry.
sheldon Well, I’m sorry, but that is your second strike.
penny What?
sheldon You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.
penny A sports metaphor?
sheldon Yes, baseball.
penny All right, yeah, I’ll play along. What was my first strike?
sheldon March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
penny I did?
sheldon The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
penny Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats.
sheldon I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.
leonard Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
howard You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.
penny Come on, I touched one onion ring.
sheldon And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.
penny Oh, honey, the buses don’t go where you live, do they?
sheldon Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.
leonard Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.
howard One of us, one of us.
penny Well, what a thrill.
sheldon You’re sitting in my spot.
penny Oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me.
sheldon Leonard, she’s in my spot.
leonard Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.
penny I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.
sheldon All right, that’s it. Strike three.
penny Ooh, strike three.
penny I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
leonard Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.
penny Yeah, you do that.
leonard Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!
howard So based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.
raj Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.
howard When we find it, you want to go with us?
leonard To do what?
raj Party with the pretty girls, dude!
leonard Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place.
howard That’s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
sheldon No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.
howard Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America’s top models.
raj And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
penny Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.
leonard Thank you.
penny Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.
sheldon Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
penny Oh, I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
sheldon Why?
penny Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don’t like your attitude.
sheldon You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.
penny Yeah, no, there’s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.
howard I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.
leonard Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.
penny Hi.
leonard Look, here’s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
penny Really? Well, that’s great.
leonard Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?
penny What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.
leonard Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say.
penny Leonard, don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him.
leonard We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.
penny Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do.
leonard Well, actually, technically, you did do it.
penny That’s strike one, Leonard.
penny There you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
sheldon Thank you.
penny Go ahead, eat it. I dare you
howard That’s it. There’s the house, I found America’s top models!
raj Are you sure?
howard Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.
leonard You can recognize people on Google Earth?
howard Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.
leonard NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?
howard It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.
penny Okay, where is he?
leonard Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
penny Here. Try and go online.
leonard Problem with the WiFi?
penny No, just try.
sheldon Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.
penny Well?
leonard I reiterate, knuckle under.
penny No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
leonard Oh, Penny, you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
penny I don’t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
howard No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.
leonard There, see? Problem solved.
howard Voila!
sheldon Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.
leonard Thanks a lot, Howard.
howard What are you complaining about? I’m the one who has to take the class again.
sheldon Oh! Hello.
penny Time to do your laundry, huh?
sheldon It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
penny I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.
sheldon What are you implying?
penny I’m implying that you’re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant. Knuckle under, my ass.
penny Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?
sheldon No problem, I’ll just do my laundry another night.
penny Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
sheldon Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
penny Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.
penny Sheldon Sheldon Sheldon.
sheldon Yes?
penny Where are my clothes?
sheldon Your clothes?
penny Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.
sheldon Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
penny Sheldon, where are my clothes?
sheldon You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?
penny How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
sheldon When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!
penny Get them down.
sheldon Apologize.
penny Never.
sheldon Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.
penny Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I’ve done some stupid things, you’ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
sheldon I’ve done no stupid things.
penny Look, you’ve got to meet me halfway here.
sheldon I am meeting you halfway, I’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things.
leonard Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
penny Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it’s junior rodeo on.
leonard Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?
sheldon I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.
leonard A-a-a-aw!
sheldon Mwah-ha-ha.
penny Telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?
leonard No. Look, this has to stop.
penny Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
leonard All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here.
penny What’s this?
leonard Sheldon’s Kryptonite.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard He can never know that I gave that to you.
penny Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?
leonard It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
raj Oh, pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.
howard God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.
leonard Okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy.
howard You know what? If it’s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I’m creepy.
leonard Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I’ll get him. Sheldon, it’s for you.
sheldon Who is it?
leonard Your mother.
sheldon Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?
leonard Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
sheldon Penny,Penny,Penny… I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here’s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.
penny Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
sheldon Thank you.
penny Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny Yes?
sheldon Well played.
penny Thank you.
penny Understood.
model Can I help you
howard Yes, we here to fix the cable.
model I think we have satellite.
howard That’s what I meant.
model Oh. Okay, come on in.
howard She’s taller than all the women in my family combined.
raj What do we do now?
howard Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
