penny Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.
sheldon_cooper No.
penny Why not?
sheldon_cooper Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
penny Are you fun in any of them?
sheldon_cooper The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
penny All right, want some French toast?
sheldon_cooper It’s Oatmeal Day.
penny Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
sheldon_cooper Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
sheldon_cooper Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
sheldon_cooper It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.
leonard_hofstadter We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
sheldon_cooper I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
leonard_hofstadter No, her bed kind of… broke.
sheldon_cooper That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition
penny A homunculus?
leonard_hofstadter Perfectly formed miniature human being.
penny Oh, you’re my little homunculus.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t do that.
penny Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
sheldon_cooper I want oatmeal.
penny Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass.
sheldon_cooper I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.
penny You know what, I give up. He’s impossible.
sheldon_cooper I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
sheldon_cooper What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.
leonard_hofstadter I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
sheldon_cooper You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
leonard_hofstadter It’s a…
sheldon_cooper Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday.
penny Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim.
leonard_hofstadter Wow!
penny I know. What are the odds?
sheldon_cooper Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
penny Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, you guys, let it go.
penny Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
sheldon_cooper Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
penny Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
leonard_hofstadter What was that?
sheldon_cooper You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
leonard_hofstadter It does. But in my experience, you don’t.
sheldon_cooper There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable.
howard_wolowitz What’s going on, day dwellers?
penny Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?
howard_wolowitz No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
penny Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?
howard_wolowitz No, no. I’m going out like this.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, what did you do?
howard_wolowitz They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
sheldon_cooper You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.
howard_wolowitz Really?
sheldon_cooper Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?
howard_wolowitz Okay, how about you two? Look, I’ve got some extra tat sleeves.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you carrying extras?
howard_wolowitz Well, In case I snag one on someone’s nipple ring.
penny Uh, yeah, I think we’ll pass.
howard_wolowitz Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?
leonard_hofstadter In this case, you bet she is.
howard_wolowitz Yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.
leonard_hofstadter They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
penny They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
sheldon_cooper Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
penny Thank you.
raj_koothrappali I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
howard_wolowitz It’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.
raj_koothrappali Oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?
howard_wolowitz Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?
raj_koothrappali No, I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.
howard_wolowitz What?
raj_koothrappali Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.
howard_wolowitz Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.
raj_koothrappali Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 Good for you.
howard_wolowitz I’m actually much morelost than he is.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 Nice ink.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 Two light beers.
raj_koothrappali Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?
second_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 What’s your names?
howard_wolowitz I’m Howard.
raj_koothrappali Raj.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 I’m Bethany.
howard_wolowitz Nice to meet you, Bethany.
raj_koothrappali Yes, very nice.
bethany Nice to meet you too.
second_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 I’m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.
raj_koothrappali Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
penny What’s this cartoon called again?
sheldon_cooper And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime.
penny Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
sheldon_cooper You’re here a lot now.
penny Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Chocolate?
penny Yes please. Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I… You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I know what you’re doing.
sheldon_cooper Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
sheldon_cooper Very good. Chocolate?
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
sheldon_cooper Actually, it turns out I can.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you shouldn’t.
sheldon_cooper There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.
leonard_hofstadter No, this has to stop now.
sheldon_cooper I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.
leonard_hofstadter No, you’re not sanding Penny.
sheldon_cooper Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you’re forbidden.
sheldon_cooper Bad Leonard.
bethany So what do you guys do?
howard_wolowitz Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.
raj_koothrappali Goth food.
sarah What’s goth food?
raj_koothrappali Uh… blackened salmon?
bethany No, I meant what do you do for jobs?
raj_koothrappali Oh, we’re scientists.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.
bethany What are the dark sciences
raj_koothrappali Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.
howard_wolowitz Oy vay.
raj_koothrappali That sounds really cool.
howard_wolowitz Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream.
raj_koothrappali So what do you gals do?
bethany I work at the Gap.
howard_wolowitz Really? How about that? I’ve been to the Gap.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.
sarah I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.
bethany Yeah. Why don’t we go somewhere else and have some fun?
howard_wolowitz Okay.
raj_koothrappali Sure, we like fun.
howard_wolowitz We are fun people.
raj_koothrappali Dark and fun.
bethany Come on, I know a place you’ll really dig.
howard_wolowitz Did you bring the black condoms?
raj_koothrappali In my fanny pack.
howard_wolowitz Let’s go.
raj_koothrappali Are you happy now?
howard_wolowitz Not particularly.
penny Oh’ my God, she didn’t!
leonard_hofstadter What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
sheldon_cooper Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.
leonard_hofstadter You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
sheldon_cooper No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.
leonard_hofstadter Forget it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
sheldon_cooper You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
leonard_hofstadter You’re not changing how Penny laughs.
sheldon_cooper No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.
penny Uh, sorry guys, that girl is freaky!
sheldon_cooper Come again?
penny Freaky.
sheldon_cooper Freaky?
penny Yeah, freaky.
sheldon_cooper Have a chocolate.
penny Thank you.
raj_koothrappali Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
howard_wolowitz Uh, yeah!
raj_koothrappali What is your mother going to say?
howard_wolowitz She’s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
bethany What are you going to get, Howard?
howard_wolowitz Well, I can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.
bethany Kermit the Frog?
howard_wolowitz You know Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!
bethany Get the mean little skull, and I’ll see if I can make him smile.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’d like the mean little skull, please.
sarah What are you going to get, Raj?
raj_koothrappali With my luck, hepatitis
tattooist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 Okay, here we go.
howard_wolowitz Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
tattooist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 That’s just rubbing alcohol.
howard_wolowitz I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!
tattooist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 I’m putting on the stencil.
howard_wolowitz What comes after the stencil?
tattooist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode03 This.
howard_wolowitz Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.
bethany What’s the big deal, you’ve done this before.
howard_wolowitz No, I haven’t, look. I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud.
raj_koothrappali We’re both frauds.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I think I covered that.
raj_koothrappali But I was summing up.
howard_wolowitz We’re not goth, we’re just guys.
raj_koothrappali Very, very smart guys.
bethany So you were totally scamming us?
howard_wolowitz Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
bethany I’m leaving.
sarah I’m leaving too. Not that anyone cares.
raj_koothrappali When we tell this story, let’s end it differently.
howard_wolowitz What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum.
penny Of course.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Mmm, these are so good
leonard_hofstadter Unbelievable.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.
penny well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
leonard_hofstadter Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late.
penny Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
howard_wolowitz Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.
raj_koothrappali I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?
howard_wolowitz What’s that got to do with the story?
raj_koothrappali Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
howard_wolowitz Fine, they smelled good.
raj_koothrappali Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.
howard_wolowitz Whatever.
raj_koothrappali And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.
howard_wolowitz No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry. Go on.
howard_wolowitz Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.
raj_koothrappali But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
howard_wolowitz We say they’re in a very intimate area.
raj_koothrappali Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?
howard_wolowitz Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.
raj_koothrappali But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
howard_wolowitz True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls.
raj_koothrappali Wow. What a great night.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.
howard_wolowitz Could happen.
raj_koothrappali I wonder how they smell.
