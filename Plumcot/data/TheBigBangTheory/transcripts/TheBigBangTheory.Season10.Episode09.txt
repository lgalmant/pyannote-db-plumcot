bert_kibbler Thank you very much. Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
howard_wolowitz Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.
raj_koothrappali Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
sheldon_cooper Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
leonard_hofstadter That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too.
howard_wolowitz Ah.
sheldon_cooper Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.
leonard_hofstadter How much money did he win?
raj_koothrappali Over half a million dollars.
leonard_hofstadter Wow.
howard_wolowitz And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.
howard_wolowitz Here he comes.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Be polite.
sheldon_cooper I know how to behave.
howard_wolowitz Do you?
raj_koothrappali Hey, congratulations Bert.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, good for you.
howard_wolowitz That’s amazing.
bert_kibbler Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
sheldon_cooper Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.
bert_kibbler I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.
sheldon_cooper Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice.
leonard_hofstadter I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.
sheldon_cooper Well, aren’t you a peach.
sheldon_cooper Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it.
leonard_hofstadter Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.
penny Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
sheldon_cooper Who listens to the radio any more?
amy_farrah_fowler Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
leonard_hofstadter They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
penny You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?
sheldon_cooper You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning.
sheldon_cooper You want me to read a geology paper?
amy_farrah_fowler Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy.
howard_wolowitz You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who is it?
howard_wolowitz Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where did you get that?
howard_wolowitz I found him in an old box.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why would you buy it?
howard_wolowitz I didn’t buy it. I made it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Last question. What is wrong with you?
howard_wolowitz What’s the big deal?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, it’s in poor taste.
howard_wolowitz No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.
remotecontrol_hawking#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?
howard_wolowitz His eyes also light up in the dark.
leonard_hofstadter It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
penny It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
sheldon_cooper Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why.
amy_farrah_fowler Sounds like the night we had coitus.
sheldon_cooper I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?
penny Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
penny I, I knew the answer. I got excited.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.
sheldon_cooper That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I’m trying to help you.
sheldon_cooper Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
leonard_hofstadter You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…
howard_wolowitz Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it.
raj_koothrappali This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.
howard_wolowitz You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.
howard_wolowitz I have no problem calling him.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine, then do it.
howard_wolowitz Fine, I will.
bernadette_rostenkowski While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.
raj_koothrappali What’s this button do?
remotecontrol_hawking#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.
howard_wolowitz You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
raj_koothrappali I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
sheldon_cooper I admire you, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Really, why?
sheldon_cooper You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.
leonard_hofstadter I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head.
sheldon_cooper How did you deal with it?
leonard_hofstadter I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock.
leonard_hofstadter Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
leonard_hofstadter Let it fly.
sheldon_cooper Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…
amy_farrah_fowler What happened?
sheldon_cooper I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
leonard_hofstadter Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
penny Well, and what happened to you?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop.
leonard_hofstadter Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you.
amy_farrah_fowler Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
leonard_hofstadter You’re up.
penny This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.
sheldon_cooper Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?
penny I do, your life is fine you big baby.
sheldon_cooper Maybe you’re right.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
leonard_hofstadter If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.
penny There you go.
sheldon_cooper And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
penny There you go.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s up?
howard_wolowitz I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
amy_farrah_fowler Yep.
howard_wolowitz Do you think this is in poor taste?
leonard_hofstadter Does it spin around and do tricks?
howard_wolowitz Yeah
leonard_hofstadter Then yeah.
howard_wolowitz What do you think?
barry_kripke That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom.
howard_wolowitz All right, we’re done. It’s offensive.
sheldon_cooper Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.
howard_wolowitz You’re in a good mood.
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?
raj_koothrappali Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward.
sheldon_cooper Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.
howard_wolowitz What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
leonard_hofstadter I think he might be learning on his own.
raj_koothrappali Then the robot uprising has begun.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.
raj_koothrappali He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.
sheldon_cooper Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.
bert_kibbler Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great.
sheldon_cooper Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.
bert_kibbler You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year.
sheldon_cooper Really? I didn’t know that.
bert_kibbler So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?
sheldon_cooper You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me. Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
sheldon_cooper No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t imagine you being violent.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.
sheldon_cooper I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
raj_koothrappali It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
amy_farrah_fowler What about me and Sheldon?
raj_koothrappali Sure.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.
raj_koothrappali Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.
amy_farrah_fowler Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks.
penny Aw, thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.
penny You liked my short hair, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.
penny Seriously, none of you liked it?
bernadette_rostenkowski I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
penny You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?
bernadette_rostenkowski I think he looks cute.
howard_wolowitz And I think you’re cute.
raj_koothrappali I think you’re both cute.
penny I think I hate all of you nerds.
sheldon_cooper Sorry I’m moving slowly.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.
leonard_hofstadter Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
sheldon_cooper I can’t take this any more. Bert. Bert. Bert.
bert_kibbler Come in.
sheldon_cooper All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk.
bert_kibbler What happened to you?
sheldon_cooper Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.
bert_kibbler Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for.
sheldon_cooper I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.
bert_kibbler Is it working?
sheldon_cooper No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.
bert_kibbler Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.
sheldon_cooper We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go.
bert_kibbler Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?
sheldon_cooper You know what? This isn’t gonna work.
bert_kibbler Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?
bert_kibbler It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better.
penny I can’t believe you punched Bert.
sheldon_cooper I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better.
stephen_hawking Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking.
stephen_hawking I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy.
sheldon_cooper Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.
stephen_hawking Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.
penny Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair.
stephen_hawking It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons.
sheldon_cooper How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
stephen_hawking I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care.
stephen_hawking Don’t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you’re too brilliant.
amy_farrah_fowler How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?
sheldon_cooper I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
stephen_hawking I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.
sheldon_cooper What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?
leonard_hofstadter Do not tell Wolowitz.
amy_farrah_fowler Way ahead of you.
ellen_degeneres A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that’s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they’re dumb.
sheldon_cooper Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.
