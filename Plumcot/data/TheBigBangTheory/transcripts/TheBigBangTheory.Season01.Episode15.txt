leonard_hofstadter On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.
raj_koothrappali Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.
raj_koothrappali We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?
leonard_hofstadter I don't know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board. What's going on?
howard_wolowitz Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon's office? Is she lost?
howard_wolowitz Don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe she's his lawyer.
howard_wolowitz Well she's free to examine my briefs.
leonard_hofstadter Howard...
howard_wolowitz I know, I'm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 Well, that should do it.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for coming by. Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey buddy.
sheldon_cooper Buddy.
howard_wolowitz Sorry I'm late, I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.
sheldon_cooper How can you be late, I wasn't expecting you at all.
howard_wolowitz Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and... BAM! Howard Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?
sheldon_cooper Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard.
missy_cooper It's nice to meet you.
leonard_hofstadter You too, swell, also.
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter So, how do you two know each other.
missy_cooper Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
sheldon_cooper She's my twin sister, she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it.
missy_cooper It's because you have no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.
sheldon_cooper How exactly would one measure a sense of humor? A humormometer?
howard_wolowitz Well, I think you're delightfully droll. Or as the French say, tres drole.
missy_cooper Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and... I'm sorry what was your name again.
sheldon_cooper Rajesh.
leonard_hofstadter So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?
howard_wolowitz Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.
missy_cooper My friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
howard_wolowitz Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
missy_cooper And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
sheldon_cooper The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she.
missy_cooper I guess that's why they call you a genius.
sheldon_cooper They call me a genius because I'm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I'm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Woah, woah.
leonard_hofstadter If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?
missy_cooper Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like company. Even as a little boy he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.
sheldon_cooper They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.
leonard_hofstadter Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.
sheldon_cooper No we don't.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Shelly, she's family.
sheldon_cooper So what? I don't issue invitations to your mother.
missy_cooper Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.
sheldon_cooper And don't ever call me Shelly.
leonard_hofstadter So it's settled. You'll stay with us.
howard_wolowitz I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right?
sheldon_cooper What just happened?
missy_cooper So anyway, we're eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.
leonard_hofstadter Hee-hee, just classic.
sheldon_cooper I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
missy_cooper He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
sheldon_cooper Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
missy_cooper Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there's a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.
howard_wolowitz Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?
missy_cooper Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.
sheldon_cooper Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
penny Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.
leonard_hofstadter Those are not mine.
penny Really, they have your little name label in them.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I do, I use those... uh... just to polish up my... spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.
missy_cooper Hi.
penny Wow, you don't look that much alike.
howard_wolowitz Can I get a hallelujah.
sheldon_cooper Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.
howard_wolowitz Hallelujah.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guess what. I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.
penny Hey, good for you, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello Missy. They mentioned there may be side effects.
raj_koothrappali So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?
missy_cooper Well, there's Dr Patel at our church.
raj_koothrappali Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.
howard_wolowitz Do you like motorcycles, 'cos I ride a hog.
raj_koothrappali A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
howard_wolowitz You still have to wear a helmet.
raj_koothrappali Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
missy_cooper The sex book?
raj_koothrappali The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.
penny Hey, Sheldon's sister's pretty cute, I w...
leonard_hofstadter I wasn't staring!
penny I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall... and perfect.
penny Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?
sheldon_cooper I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.
leonard_hofstadter I brought snacks.
missy_cooper Oh my! Gherkins and...
leonard_hofstadter Onion dip, it's onion dip.
missy_cooper Oh.
leonard_hofstadter We don't entertain much.
raj_koothrappali Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?
missy_cooper I guess.
raj_koothrappali We Indians invented them. You're welcome.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome!
penny Missy, I'm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?
missy_cooper God yes. Thanks.
penny You're welcome.
missy_cooper Bye guys.
howard_wolowitz Bye Missy.
leonard_hofstadter Bye Missy, see you.
penny Goodbye Leonard!
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.
howard_wolowitz Okay, you two have to back off.
raj_koothrappali Why should I back off, you back off dude.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister.
howard_wolowitz So what, you've already got Penny.
leonard_hofstadter How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
howard_wolowitz So I can have Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Hell, no!
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, can I interject something. I'm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
sheldon_cooper I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper That's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
howard_wolowitz I'm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!
raj_koothrappali Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?
sheldon_cooper Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.
leonard_hofstadter That's fascinating, but I...
sheldon_cooper I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.
leonard_hofstadter Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz... they're hitting on your sister.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.
leonard_hofstadter That's great, but I...
sheldon_cooper What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever. You have to do something about it.
sheldon_cooper Why?
leonard_hofstadter Because she's your sister.
sheldon_cooper I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh... oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
sheldon_cooper I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.
leonard_hofstadter Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.
sheldon_cooper You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.
raj_koothrappali I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!
howard_wolowitz I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.
sheldon_cooper Alright, that's enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I'm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.
howard_wolowitz Who are you to decide that?
leonard_hofstadter He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.
sheldon_cooper You're out too, by the way.
leonard_hofstadter Say what?
sheldon_cooper It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.
howard_wolowitz What are you so happy about?
raj_koothrappali I'm not happy, it's the medication, I can't stop smiling.
sheldon_cooper Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.
howard_wolowitz Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?
leonard_hofstadter We all make mistakes, let's move on.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.
sheldon_cooper How so?
raj_koothrappali Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
sheldon_cooper In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.
raj_koothrappali I think you're focussing entirely too much on the drugs.
howard_wolowitz Is it 'cause I'm Jewish, 'cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.
sheldon_cooper This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
sheldon_cooper Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
missy_cooper Oh really?
sheldon_cooper Oops.
missy_cooper Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?
sheldon_cooper Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
leonard_hofstadter We all make mistakes, let's move on.
missy_cooper Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
sheldon_cooper Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.
missy_cooper What on earth are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.
missy_cooper And what do you mean, mediocre stock?
sheldon_cooper That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.
missy_cooper Sheldon 2.0?
sheldon_cooper Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.
missy_cooper You have got to be kidding me!
sheldon_cooper Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
missy_cooper Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.
sheldon_cooper I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.
missy_cooper I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?
sheldon_cooper I have an alternate proposal.
missy_cooper Go on.
sheldon_cooper You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.
sheldon_cooper Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
howard_wolowitz Look, we have to settle this.
leonard_hofstadter I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.
raj_koothrappali She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.
howard_wolowitz Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.
raj_koothrappali Don't start with me dude.
howard_wolowitz You want to go again? Let's go.
leonard_hofstadter Sit down.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
leonard_hofstadter If we're going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way. The honorable way.
leonard_hofstadter And he's down!
howard_wolowitz Come on, come on, get up.
leonard_hofstadter Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.
sheldon_cooper I weep for humanity.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news.
penny Ah, hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?
penny Uh, pretty much, why?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?
penny Of course.
missy_cooper Hi, Leonard, what's up?
leonard_hofstadter Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?
missy_cooper That's so sweet. But no thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. You have other plans, or...?
missy_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Alright uh... enjoy the rest of your evening.
missy_cooper Thanks. See you.
leonard_hofstadter Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.
penny What do you want, Howard?
howard_wolowitz I'm fine, thanks for asking. I've come to call on Missy.
penny Missy?
missy_cooper Hi Howard.
howard_wolowitz The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
missy_cooper Not really. No.
howard_wolowitz Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. Da-dah!
missy_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
penny Missy?
raj_koothrappali Thank you. I apprec... apprec... appreeee... oh-oh.
penny Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?
missy_cooper Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you'd show up.
missy_cooper We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.
missy_cooper Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?
sheldon_cooper Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.
missy_cooper Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.
sheldon_cooper Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.
missy_cooper Come on, Shelly. I want you to know I'm very proud of you.
sheldon_cooper Really?
missy_cooper Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.
sheldon_cooper You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?
missy_cooper Well yeah.
sheldon_cooper I'm a theoretical physicist.
missy_cooper What's the difference?
sheldon_cooper What's the difference?
missy_cooper Goodbye Shelly.
sheldon_cooper My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.
