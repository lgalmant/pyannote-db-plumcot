leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, your food’s getting cold.
sheldon_cooper I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
penny It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
raj_koothrappali So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
howard_wolowitz Let me see.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?
penny Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, so, I’m out.
raj_koothrappali What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
sheldon_cooper Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Don’t waste my time.
leonard_hofstadter You get that these are personalised action figures.
penny Honey, if you want one, just get one.
howard_wolowitz You’re still out, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yep.
sheldon_cooper A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!
barry_kripke Cooper?
sheldon_cooper Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.
barry_kripke What’s that?
sheldon_cooper That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?
barry_kripke I have some bad news. You’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.
sheldon_cooper So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones.
barry_kripke No, they’re making us work together.
sheldon_cooper That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
leonard_hofstadter Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
howard_wolowitz Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.
raj_koothrappali They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.
leonard_hofstadter A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
howard_wolowitz Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.
raj_koothrappali Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
howard_wolowitz Oh, man. Look at my nose.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe it’s a shipping problem.
howard_wolowitz What?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
raj_koothrappali This sucks.
howard_wolowitz I can’t believe I wasted all that money.
leonard_hofstadter Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.
penny I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
leonard_hofstadter Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.
penny Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.
leonard_hofstadter They could show bloopers. Oh, no.
penny What is that?
leonard_hofstadter That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place.
penny Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?
leonard_hofstadter Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
penny You doing okay, sweetie?
sheldon_cooper There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay.
leonard_hofstadter Want me to make you some tea?
sheldon_cooper Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.
leonard_hofstadter So, cocoa?
sheldon_cooper Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, teacher! Me! Me!
sheldon_cooper See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
penny What beverage do you make for that?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
sheldon_cooper Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
barry_kripke What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.
sheldon_cooper And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.
barry_kripke We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.
sheldon_cooper Why don’t you show me yours first.
barry_kripke You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.
sheldon_cooper How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
barry_kripke How do I know you’re not going to do that with mine?
sheldon_cooper Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.
barry_kripke Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other’s work, meet again tomowow?
sheldon_cooper Fine.
barry_kripke Nice twy. This is bwank paper.
sheldon_cooper And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
barry_kripke Cough it up, Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Very well.
barry_kripke If this one’s bwank, too, I’m going to be fuwious.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
raj_koothrappali You! Always bet on black.
howard_wolowitz Get that waste of money out of my face.
raj_koothrappali It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them. He’s right, dawg.
howard_wolowitz Please, I’m working.
raj_koothrappali You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah? How’s that?
raj_koothrappali Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
howard_wolowitz I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
raj_koothrappali Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but they’re so expensive.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
howard_wolowitz Well, the prices have been coming down.
raj_koothrappali Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.
howard_wolowitz And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…
raj_koothrappali Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
howard_wolowitz We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.
raj_koothrappali Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
sheldon_cooper I’m fine.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what’s going on?
sheldon_cooper I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?
sheldon_cooper What do we have to lose?
amy_farrah_fowler How’s that?
sheldon_cooper I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late.
sheldon_cooper I can’t go in today. I’m sick.
leonard_hofstadter You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.
sheldon_cooper No, look.
leonard_hofstadter 128.
sheldon_cooper See?
leonard_hofstadter What did you do, put this in your tea?
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
sheldon_cooper Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.
sheldon_cooper All right, geez. What a grouch.
leonard_hofstadter How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
howard_wolowitz Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?
raj_koothrappali I think this thing was made in China.
howard_wolowitz Eh, what can you do?
raj_koothrappali Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.
howard_wolowitz Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
raj_koothrappali And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
howard_wolowitz Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I wish I was in better shape.
howard_wolowitz Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
howard_wolowitz All right, you can suck it in a little bit.
barry_kripke Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.
sheldon_cooper I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.
barry_kripke Don’t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.
sheldon_cooper We do?
barry_kripke You have a girlfwiend.
sheldon_cooper So?
barry_kripke So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.
sheldon_cooper Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.
barry_kripke You wucky bastard.
sheldon_cooper What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.
barry_kripke Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we’re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.
sheldon_cooper I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic
howard_wolowitz Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz Say hello to my little friend.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.
howard_wolowitz I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Howie, I love these.
howard_wolowitz I thought you might.
bernadette_rostenkowski Were they expensive?
howard_wolowitz Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.
bernadette_rostenkowski How?
howard_wolowitz Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.
bernadette_rostenkowski $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?
howard_wolowitz Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.
bernadette_rostenkowski At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?
howard_wolowitz It’s kind of dawning on me now.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.
howard_wolowitz What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
bernadette_rostenkowski I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
howard_wolowitz Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?
penny All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?
sheldon_cooper Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.
leonard_hofstadter Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
penny That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.
penny Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
sheldon_cooper Of course.
penny You ever going to sleep with Amy?
sheldon_cooper That’s awfully personal.
leonard_hofstadter We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.
penny Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?
sheldon_cooper Well, word around the university is I’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
penny All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy.
penny Then what’s the problem?
sheldon_cooper Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.
leonard_hofstadter Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
penny Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
sheldon_cooper It’s a possibility.
penny Oh, my God! Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
penny Oh, my God!
leonard_hofstadter Ow!
raj_koothrappali Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
howard_wolowitz Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
raj_koothrappali Wow, that’s harsh.
howard_wolowitz Tell me about it.
raj_koothrappali Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
howard_wolowitz Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.
sheldon_cooper Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant.
barry_kripke Whatever. You get any wast night?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
barry_kripke Gave it to her good, huh?
sheldon_cooper No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…
barry_kripke Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t notice.
barry_kripke How could you not notice?
sheldon_cooper I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
barry_kripke Ah, you’re kiwing me, Cooper!
sheldon_cooper Can we get back to work?
barry_kripke Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?
sheldon_cooper Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
barry_kripke A wocket? You’we a fweak! I wove it!
