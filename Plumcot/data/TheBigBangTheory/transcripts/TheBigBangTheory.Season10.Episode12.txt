penny Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.
penny Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.
penny Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
penny Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
sheldon_cooper Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.
amy_farrah_fowler It was not a great trip.
penny Well, you’re home now.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?
penny I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
leonard_hofstadter Did you at least have a good flight down there?
sheldon_cooper It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.
penny So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?
leonard_hofstadter And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.
sheldon_cooper Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…
sheldon_cooper How did we get in the car?
leonard_hofstadter Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
amy_farrah_fowler I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.
amy_farrah_fowler So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together.
sheldon_cooper Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe there won’t be one.
sheldon_cooper There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it.
sheldon_cooper Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.
penny Do boys have flowers?
leonard_hofstadter Who knows what he has down there.
penny Mm.
sheldon_cooper Anyway…
mary_cooper Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.
sheldon_cooper Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?
mary_cooper You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you’re in a church with a guitar.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.
mary_cooper Oh, it’s my pleasure. Mm. I’m so glad y’all could make it. So, tell me, what’s going on back home?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.
mary_cooper Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?
sheldon_cooper Welcome to Texas.
amy_farrah_fowler They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.
sheldon_cooper Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.
mary_cooper Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.
sheldon_cooper All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not.
mary_cooper Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.
sheldon_cooper What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there.
mary_cooper Obviously, I would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I’m very happy for you.
sheldon_cooper And what special circumstances are those?
penny Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad.
mary_cooper Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.
sheldon_cooper What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
mary_cooper No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there’d be nurses.
sheldon_cooper Well, this is highly insulting.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, don’t overreact.
sheldon_cooper I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.
amy_farrah_fowler Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
mary_cooper Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll take over from here.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
mary_cooper He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you going to?
mary_cooper Oh, heck no.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what, what are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
mary_cooper You startin’ to see why I didn’t go in there? Sheldon, if you’re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain’t changing my mind.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re ignoring the fins, okay.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think that’s what she’s saying.
sheldon_cooper And?
amy_farrah_fowler That’s exactly what she was saying.
sheldon_cooper Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely not.
penny That’s too loud.
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely not.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.
sheldon_cooper Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…
amy_farrah_fowler What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
sheldon_cooper I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
sheldon_cooper I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
amy_farrah_fowler She was gonna find out eventually.
sheldon_cooper Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.
sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
amy_farrah_fowler This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
sheldon_cooper You managed the situation?
amy_farrah_fowler That’s right.
sheldon_cooper So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life.
amy_farrah_fowler Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you.
sheldon_cooper I have gotten much better at that.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you? How am I feeling right now?
sheldon_cooper What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
amy_farrah_fowler You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
sheldon_cooper How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
amy_farrah_fowler Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
sheldon_cooper Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
howard_wolowitz Hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hi. There’s the little family!
raj_koothrappali Hello.
stuart_bloom Hello.
leonard_hofstadter And their Sherpas.
penny Mm.
howard_wolowitz The baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?
penny Yeah. Go ahead.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you need help?
howard_wolowitz No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry we’re late.
penny Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up.
sheldon_cooper How did we get in the car?
penny Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.
leonard_hofstadter On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.
sheldon_cooper I was acting odd intentionally.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? So you can control it?
penny Okay. Then what happened?
sheldon_cooper Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. My mother made me take it out. Amy put alcohol on it. And here we are.
howard_wolowitz What did we miss?
bernadette_rostenkowski I couldn’t explain it if I tried.
penny So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?
amy_farrah_fowler Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.
howard_wolowitz So what did you and Leonard do?
penny Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.
leonard_hofstadter It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, what happened?
leonard_hofstadter Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks.
stuart_bloom I don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
penny To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.
howard_wolowitz What happened
penny You do make a cute elf.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
penny Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.
leonard_hofstadter Oh cool, I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.
leonard_hofstadter Stupid idea.
penny No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go.
leonard_hofstadter For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!
penny Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens.
leonard_hofstadter You know how easily I blister.
penny Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit.
leonard_hofstadter Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.
penny Fine.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny There’s something on the windshield.
penny You need a break?
leonard_hofstadter Do not need a break.
penny There’s no shame in asking for a break.
leonard_hofstadter If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break.
penny Ugh. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
penny There’s a tree on you.
leonard_hofstadter You want to decorate it tonight?
penny Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.
leonard_hofstadter I hope it kills us both.
leonard_hofstadter By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.
sheldon_cooper So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
sheldon_cooper Hey, how’s life with your baby?
amy_farrah_fowler Really? You’re never gonna touch their baby?
sheldon_cooper To this day I’ve never touched Stuart.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, please stop crying, I’m begging you. I don’t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. Shh. What have we done?
howard_wolowitz Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.
bernadette_rostenkowski It took me two hours to get her down.
raj_koothrappali You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always, sometimes we’d leave.
howard_wolowitz Hey, he got her to stop.
bernadette_rostenkowski That was so fast.
raj_koothrappali Oh, he’s really good with her.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, he has a gift.
howard_wolowitz What’s the matter?
bernadette_rostenkowski Nothing, these are happy tears.
howard_wolowitz Oh, good.
bernadette_rostenkowski No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?
howard_wolowitz I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not funny.
raj_koothrappali She’s tired, that was funny.
bernadette_rostenkowski Everyone’s a better mom than me.
raj_koothrappali Oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk.
sheldon_cooper Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
leonard_hofstadter Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
stuart_bloom Oh, I just talked to her. I’ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.
penny You poor things you must be exhausted.
howard_wolowitz It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
bernadette_rostenkowski How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
howard_wolowitz She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Now you hate me too.
howard_wolowitz Shh, I don’t hate you.
sheldon_cooper It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
penny So things started to turn around?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
leonard_hofstadter Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice.
howard_wolowitz Bernie?
bernadette_rostenkowski Shh. She’s asleep.
howard_wolowitz Great. And where are you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Down here.
howard_wolowitz Oh. This is new.
bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know what else to do. It worked.
howard_wolowitz Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t make me laugh.
howard_wolowitz Do you need help getting out?
bernadette_rostenkowski I think I live here now. It’s fine.
howard_wolowitz Is it okay if I get some sleep?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, go ahead.
howard_wolowitz Good job, Mommy. I’m proud of you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t make me cry, either.
howard_wolowitz Good night. I love both my girls.
bernadette_rostenkowski We love you, too.
penny I can’t believe you fit in the crib.
bernadette_rostenkowski I could take a bath in the sink. I don’t, but I can.
raj_koothrappali So how were your holidays?
stuart_bloom Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She’s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go… oh come on.
amy_farrah_fowler That was fun, thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, thanks.
penny Our pleasure.
leonard_hofstadter See you guys at work.
raj_koothrappali Be there bright and early.
howard_wolowitz Not me, paternity leave.
sheldon_cooper Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
howard_wolowitz With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this.
