penny Hey, Leonard, check this out.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, she’s doing it again.
leonard_hofstadter I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
sheldon_cooper No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
penny You want me to put it back?
sheldon_cooper Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Hey.
howard_wolowitz Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred.
howard_wolowitz I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.
leonard_hofstadter Sure. The more, the merrier.
sheldon_cooper Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon…
sheldon_cooper Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.
penny Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.
sheldon_cooper Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?
leonard_hofstadter Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys.
all@ NO!
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
penny Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why not?
leonard_hofstadter That’s where Sheldon sits.
bernadette_rostenkowski He can’t sit somewhere else?
penny Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, I love your shoes.
penny Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?
bernadette_rostenkowski Where’d you get them?
penny Shoes for Less.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve been meaning to go over there.
penny Oh, great selection, great prices.
sheldon_cooper My mother was right. Hell is real.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.
penny Womenfolk?
howard_wolowitz Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
penny Just eat your dinner.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.
penny Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.
penny Howard, never let her go.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
leonard_hofstadter I am. Are you interested in physics?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s amazing.
sheldon_cooper Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.
sheldon_cooper Howard?
howard_wolowitz Yeah?
sheldon_cooper Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper Bazinga. I don’t care.
raj_koothrappali Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.
sheldon_cooper That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
raj_koothrappali And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive.
sheldon_cooper Just need a little more practice.
raj_koothrappali What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.
penny Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
sheldon_cooper It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again.
penny It’s not about shoes.
sheldon_cooper Then speak.
penny Um, actually, can we do it in private?
sheldon_cooper All right. Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy.
penny Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
sheldon_cooper A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.
penny Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.
sheldon_cooper Why can’t Leonard teach you?
penny ‘Cause I want to surprise him.
sheldon_cooper Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
penny Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
sheldon_cooper Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.
penny You’re sitting here playing video games all day.
sheldon_cooper Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?
penny Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
sheldon_cooper The one with the frogs.
penny Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so.
penny Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.
penny Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo.
sheldon_cooper Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.
howard_wolowitz Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who are all those people?
howard_wolowitz Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.
howard_wolowitz Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
bernadette_rostenkowski He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I got it.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, how’s your experiment going?
leonard_hofstadter Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.
bernadette_rostenkowski Boy, I’d love to see that.
leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome to come.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?
howard_wolowitz Like Hanukkah in July.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do they have that?
howard_wolowitz No.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.
howard_wolowitz Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, honey. All right, what is your deal?
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
howard_wolowitz Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah? So?
howard_wolowitz Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
howard_wolowitz Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
leonard_hofstadter Has it ever worked?
howard_wolowitz Not so far, but that’s not the point!
leonard_hofstadter Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend.
howard_wolowitz I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy.
leonard_hofstadter I believe you.
sheldon_cooper Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
penny Ready to get started?
sheldon_cooper One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?
penny Um, I don’t have one.
sheldon_cooper How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
penny I have to take notes?
sheldon_cooper How else are you gonna study for the tests?
penny There’s gonna be a test?
sheldon_cooper Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
penny Thank you.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.
penny Ancient Greece?
sheldon_cooper Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?
penny Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?
sheldon_cooper This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
penny Twenty six hundred years?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?
penny I have to go to the bathroom.
sheldon_cooper Can’t you hold it?
penny Not for twenty six hundred years.
sheldon_cooper Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard?
howard_wolowitz Huh?
bernadette_rostenkowski It unhooks in the front.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that explains a lot.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, I’m home!
howard_wolowitz Of course.
debbie_wolowitz Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I’m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.
howard_wolowitz That’s great, Ma!
debbie_wolowitz What’s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess I should go.
howard_wolowitz No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?
debbie_wolowitz Lamb stew? I’d have to go to the supermarket.
howard_wolowitz Please? I got a real hankering.
debbie_wolowitz Oh, I can’t say no to my little tushy face. I’ll be back soon.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, Ma.
debbie_wolowitz Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?
howard_wolowitz Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
debbie_wolowitz You’re right! When you’re right, you’re right! What if they’re out of the Le Seur?
howard_wolowitz Then get the regular!
debbie_wolowitz All right! You don’t have to yell!
howard_wolowitz Sorry about that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let me just put that on vibrate.
howard_wolowitz I’m already on vibrate.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?
howard_wolowitz Uh, what do you mean?
bernadette_rostenkowski He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
howard_wolowitz Really? He said that?
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?
howard_wolowitz Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
howard_wolowitz I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.
sheldon_cooper Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?
penny Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
sheldon_cooper No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!
penny Sorry.
sheldon_cooper Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?
penny I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
penny Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
penny No, you just suck at teaching.
sheldon_cooper Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
penny Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?
sheldon_cooper All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
penny Not that far back!
sheldon_cooper Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
penny I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
sheldon_cooper Greece.
penny Damn it!
sheldon_cooper There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?
penny Squared?
sheldon_cooper No.
penny Aristotle?
sheldon_cooper No.
penny Five?
sheldon_cooper Oh!
penny Then I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Why are you crying?
penny Because I’m stupid!
sheldon_cooper That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.
penny Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
sheldon_cooper All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
penny Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated.
sheldon_cooper It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
penny Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
sheldon_cooper A good question.
penny Thank you.
sheldon_cooper And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?
penny Oh, balls.
sheldon_cooper It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
howard_wolowitz Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.
leonard_hofstadter What did I do now?
howard_wolowitz I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.
leonard_hofstadter You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her.
leonard_hofstadter What was I supposed to tell her?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.
leonard_hofstadter And what would that be?
howard_wolowitz Come on, do I have to think of everything?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you doing here?
howard_wolowitz Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid.
leonard_hofstadter You told her my experiment was stupid?
howard_wolowitz I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.
leonard_hofstadter Should I, um, leave you two alone?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, Leonard, you should hear this.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go.
howard_wolowitz Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not.
leonard_hofstadter We’re shocked.
howard_wolowitz Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
leonard_hofstadter Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.
howard_wolowitz But I now realize how foolish that is.
leonard_hofstadter He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
howard_wolowitz It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
howard_wolowitz Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance.
bernadette_rostenkowski What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?
leonard_hofstadter It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come here, tushy face.
leonard_hofstadter Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.
leonard_hofstadter I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
penny Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
