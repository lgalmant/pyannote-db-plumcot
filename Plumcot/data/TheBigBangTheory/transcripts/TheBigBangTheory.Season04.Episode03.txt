sheldon_cooper All right, I’m ready for my next question.
amy_farrah_fowler In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?
sheldon_cooper Uganda.
amy_farrah_fowler Defend.
sheldon_cooper Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.
amy_farrah_fowler Correct. My turn.
sheldon_cooper In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?
amy_farrah_fowler Tuned bayonets.
sheldon_cooper Defend.
amy_farrah_fowler Isn’t it obvious?
sheldon_cooper You’re right. My apologies.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you guys playing?
sheldon_cooper It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
amy_farrah_fowler We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
sheldon_cooper It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
leonard_hofstadter All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
sheldon_cooper You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here.
leonard_hofstadter I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon.
sheldon_cooper Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.
leonard_hofstadter What?
amy_farrah_fowler In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
amy_farrah_fowler Is he always like this when he loses?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.
leonard_hofstadter You bumped the table and you know it.
amy_farrah_fowler Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going to my room.
amy_farrah_fowler Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding.
leonard_hofstadter Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
raj_koothrappali Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
leonard_hofstadter What?
raj_koothrappali Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
howard_wolowitz On the potty? What are you, five?
raj_koothrappali It’s a potty. What do you call it?
howard_wolowitz Toilet.
raj_koothrappali That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?
howard_wolowitz Oh, and potty is okay?
raj_koothrappali Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
howard_wolowitz What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?
raj_koothrappali If I don’t have to boom-boom.
sheldon_cooper Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
howard_wolowitz Nice to see you.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
sheldon_cooper Sorry we’re late.
amy_farrah_fowler I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
howard_wolowitz Ah, ah.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, ah.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?
penny Hey, look, it’s Shamy.
amy_farrah_fowler Shamy?
sheldon_cooper A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy, Shamy.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.
penny All righty. What’s new?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that.
penny I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how’s your life?
amy_farrah_fowler Like everybody else’s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?
sheldon_cooper I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
sheldon_cooper It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
penny Okay, I’m just gonna walk away, ’cause I don’t want to be here.
leonard_hofstadter So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up.
howard_wolowitz Um, tell us about your work, Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler I doubt you’d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
howard_wolowitz Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
sheldon_cooper They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?
sheldon_cooper She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.
leonard_hofstadter Got it.
sheldon_cooper Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, not my point.
sheldon_cooper I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
sheldon_cooper So?
leonard_hofstadter So we already have you for all that.
sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
sheldon_cooper May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.
leonard_hofstadter Suffered in silence?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Silence?
raj_koothrappali Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?
howard_wolowitz Philadelphia.
raj_koothrappali Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
howard_wolowitz Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?
raj_koothrappali Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.
penny So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
raj_koothrappali I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?
penny Get one yourself.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.
penny God, he’s an ass when he drinks.
howard_wolowitz Oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. You just don’t hear it.
leonard_hofstadter I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
raj_koothrappali Well, if that’s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
penny I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter I did.
penny Well, what’d he say?
leonard_hofstadter Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.
penny Kinda, sorta had to?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t agree with him.
penny Well, you defended me, right?
leonard_hofstadter I tried, but he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
howard_wolowitz You’re not doing that right.
penny What?
howard_wolowitz Gimme.
penny No.
howard_wolowitz Trust me.
penny No!
howard_wolowitz I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
penny Wow, that is better.
howard_wolowitz And someday, when you have varicose veins, I’ll show you how to massage them.
raj_koothrappali Oh, God, never again.
leonard_hofstadter I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.
raj_koothrappali I was homesick.
howard_wolowitz The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills.
raj_koothrappali That’s very offensive.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, we all thought so.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no.
howard_wolowitz What?
leonard_hofstadter John and Yoko.
howard_wolowitz More like Yoko and Yoko.
sheldon_cooper Greetings.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s very impressive, for theoretical work.
sheldon_cooper Do I detect a hint of condescension?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute.
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Oooh!
sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
sheldon_cooper You take that back.
amy_farrah_fowler Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.
sheldon_cooper That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!
amy_farrah_fowler We appear to have reached an impasse.
sheldon_cooper I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
amy_farrah_fowler Seconded.
sheldon_cooper There being no objections…
all@ No, uh-uh.
sheldon_cooper The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.
amy_farrah_fowler Good day, Sheldon Cooper.
howard_wolowitz Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses.
sheldon_cooper Amen to that.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny I hear you broke up with Amy.
sheldon_cooper A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
penny Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Regarding what?
penny Amy.
sheldon_cooper I don’t follow.
penny Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.
sheldon_cooper Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before.
penny Okay. Good.
sheldon_cooper Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat.
leonard_hofstadter I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz We’re all a little worried about Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I’m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.
raj_koothrappali What does hit a reef mean?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, went splitsville.
raj_koothrappali Pardon?
leonard_hofstadter Turned to boom-boom.
raj_koothrappali Ah.
leonard_hofstadter I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
howard_wolowitz You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
leonard_hofstadter He got a cat to keep him company.
raj_koothrappali You’re kidding.
leonard_hofstadter He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.
raj_koothrappali He takes the kitty to the potty?
howard_wolowitz I thought we discussed the P-word.
raj_koothrappali Don’t try to change me, dude. I am what I am.
sheldon_cooper Oh, gentlemen.
howard_wolowitz Hey. Aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
sheldon_cooper My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
howard_wolowitz Hello.
raj_koothrappali Hi.
sheldon_cooper Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I get it. We’re worried about Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Oh, no.
sheldon_cooper Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
leonard_hofstadter So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
sheldon_cooper Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.
leonard_hofstadter Zazzles?
sheldon_cooper I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, we need to talk.
sheldon_cooper About what?
leonard_hofstadter Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
sheldon_cooper Clowder.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah, fine.
sheldon_cooper It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
sheldon_cooper It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
sheldon_cooper You didn’t break up, she dumped you.
leonard_hofstadter She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
sheldon_cooper I was there. She dumped you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
sheldon_cooper You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.
mary_cooper Where is he?
leonard_hofstadter He’s in his bedroom.
mary_cooper Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?
leonard_hofstadter No, she’s real.
mary_cooper Did they sin?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.
mary_cooper Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I’ve seen him at his best, I’ve seen him at his worst. There’s nothing he can do that’ll surprise me.
leonard_hofstadter Hold on to that thought.
sheldon_cooper Come in.
leonard_hofstadter Surprise.
sheldon_cooper Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.
mary_cooper My, my, that’s a powerful smell.
sheldon_cooper I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…
mary_cooper Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave ’em cute Jewish names.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing here?
mary_cooper Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone.
mary_cooper Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it’s creepy.
sheldon_cooper I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy.
mary_cooper You should have called sooner.
mary_cooper Shelly! Dinner’s ready!
sheldon_cooper Coming!
mary_cooper No cats!
sheldon_cooper Aw. What is she doing here?
mary_cooper I called her.
amy_farrah_fowler Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.
sheldon_cooper Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.
leonard_hofstadter 25 cats!
mary_cooper Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let’s talk.
sheldon_cooper All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.
mary_cooper Then stop talking.
sheldon_cooper Yes, ma’am.
mary_cooper Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.
sheldon_cooper That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met.
mary_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, Shelly, I can’t see it.
sheldon_cooper Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there.
amy_farrah_fowler Excellent point.
sheldon_cooper A physics point.
amy_farrah_fowler Touche.
mary_cooper Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it’s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn’t have to end it for you.
sheldon_cooper Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
sheldon_cooper I’ll go as high as 40.
amy_farrah_fowler Sixty-five.
sheldon_cooper Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?
amy_farrah_fowler I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
sheldon_cooper Would you like to see my cats?
amy_farrah_fowler I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.
sheldon_cooper Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.
leonard_hofstadter I saw what you did there.
mary_cooper He thinks he’s such a smarty pants. He’s no different from any man. You tell ’em not to do something, that’s all they want to do. If I hadn’t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we’d still be calling him Edward. Now, don’t you move. I’ll bring over all the food.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, I can do it.
mary_cooper Well, isn’t that sweet?
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.
amy_farrah_fowler Next!
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20.
amy_farrah_fowler Next!
