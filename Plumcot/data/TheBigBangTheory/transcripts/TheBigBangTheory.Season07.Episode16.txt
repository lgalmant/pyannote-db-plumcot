howard_wolowitz I’m thinking about growing a goatee.
raj_koothrappali Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?
raj_koothrappali You mean a moo-stache?
leonard_hofstadter Moo-stache.
howard_wolowitz He said it.
raj_koothrappali Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.
howard_wolowitz Say what?
raj_koothrappali Moo-stache.
leonard_hofstadter Moo-stache.
howard_wolowitz He said it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Guys, you’re being childish.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.
penny Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper You’ll get ’em next time.
penny How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. How did it go?
penny Just shut up.
raj_koothrappali Here, you can have your seat.
penny No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.
bernadette_rostenkowski Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
raj_koothrappali Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.
sheldon_cooper No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.
leonard_hofstadter I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea.
penny Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
sheldon_cooper Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
howard_wolowitz Hey, how come we never get that option?
sheldon_cooper Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.
penny Translation?
leonard_hofstadter Waah. I don’t want a table.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?
sheldon_cooper You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?
sheldon_cooper I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.
leonard_hofstadter Are you really gonna sit here all day?
sheldon_cooper Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.
leonard_hofstadter If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.
sheldon_cooper It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.
leonard_hofstadter I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.
sheldon_cooper You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
leonard_hofstadter Huh?
sheldon_cooper But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats.
leonard_hofstadter Nary an argument? Nary?
sheldon_cooper Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset.
howard_wolowitz Check it out.
raj_koothrappali Magic wand TV remote?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.
raj_koothrappali Did Bernadette think it was cool?
howard_wolowitz Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.
raj_koothrappali Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.
howard_wolowitz Well, that’s the last time I play with that. I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137
raj_koothrappali Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna believe this.
raj_koothrappali What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?
howard_wolowitz That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.
raj_koothrappali Wow. What did you tell them?
howard_wolowitz I told them I’d be honoured.
raj_koothrappali A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.
howard_wolowitz And I’m gonna miss you, too.
raj_koothrappali And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
raj_koothrappali And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.
penny Ooh, this one looks nice.
leonard_hofstadter No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
penny Why not?
leonard_hofstadter He’s afraid the original owners will come back.
penny Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it.
penny All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too.
leonard_hofstadter I know, but…
penny No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.
penny See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time.
leonard_hofstadter You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.
penny Really? This one?
leonard_hofstadter That one? Damn right I like that one.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
howard_wolowitz Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. Can I at least shower first?
howard_wolowitz No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you talking about?
howard_wolowitz Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow. Well, what did you say?
howard_wolowitz What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d ever want to go back.
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
howard_wolowitz I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.
sheldon_cooper My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.
penny Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.
sheldon_cooper You’re absolutely right. Nope.
penny Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.
sheldon_cooper So, when can we get rid of it?
leonard_hofstadter We’re not.
sheldon_cooper What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.
penny Come on, that is ridiculous.
leonard_hofstadter She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often.
penny That’s not what I’m saying.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
penny Yes.
leonard_hofstadter That.
sheldon_cooper Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.
penny Me?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s always me, take one for the team.
sheldon_cooper I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.
penny Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
leonard_hofstadter Fancy sounds like a compliment.
penny Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.
sheldon_cooper That’s not true.
penny Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.
sheldon_cooper She told you?
penny Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.
leonard_hofstadter You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.
leonard_hofstadter Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.
sheldon_cooper No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death.
penny Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
leonard_hofstadter Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
penny Oh, Sheldon, wait.
sheldon_cooper No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we should call her.
penny Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.
sheldon_cooper Amy? Amy? Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get AppleCare.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?
sheldon_cooper At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
sheldon_cooper It doesn’t?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.
sheldon_cooper Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?
amy_farrah_fowler All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?
sheldon_cooper It is hideous.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.
sheldon_cooper Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I was.
sheldon_cooper Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
amy_farrah_fowler I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it.
sheldon_cooper How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
amy_farrah_fowler I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.
sheldon_cooper Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.
raj_koothrappali It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?
raj_koothrappali Course.
bernadette_rostenkowski He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?
raj_koothrappali Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.
bernadette_rostenkowski So you’ll talk to him?
raj_koothrappali Why me?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him.
raj_koothrappali That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill.
bernadette_rostenkowski Since when am I the buzzkill?
raj_koothrappali Do you think this is cool?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I think it’s stupid.
raj_koothrappali Aha.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right, it’s great.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up.
sheldon_cooper No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.
amy_farrah_fowler Which you also figured out by yourself.
sheldon_cooper Which I also figured out by myself.
penny Well, I’m glad you’re still together.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.
amy_farrah_fowler Which is stronger than ever.
sheldon_cooper Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.
howard_wolowitz But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.
sheldon_cooper Um.
amy_farrah_fowler You don’t need to explain yourself to him.
sheldon_cooper I don’t need to explain myself to you!
amy_farrah_fowler You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
sheldon_cooper Keep the table. We don’t use that space.
amy_farrah_fowler Damn it, I got cocky.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, honey.
howard_wolowitz What’s going on?
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you should have a seat.
howard_wolowitz Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons.
raj_koothrappali Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.
mike_rostenkowski Well, I wouldn’t…
bernadette_rostenkowski Daddy.
mike_rostenkowski You’re great.
mike_massimino Can I say something?
raj_koothrappali Oh, of course.
mike_massimino Hey, Fruit Loops.
howard_wolowitz Massimino? Why are you here?
mike_massimino Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who’s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?
howard_wolowitz Sure.
mike_massimino The stuff you have is wrong.
howard_wolowitz You don’t think I did a good job up there?
mike_massimino You did a fine job. It’s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.
raj_koothrappali Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
mike_rostenkowski Like a woman. Great analogy.
howard_wolowitz Fine, maybe I was a little scared.
mike_massimino You peed in your space suit.
howard_wolowitz You’re supposed to do that.
mike_massimino Not during the fitting.
mike_rostenkowski Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?
howard_wolowitz Hang on. That was just me joking around.
mike_rostenkowski You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.
howard_wolowitz Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
raj_koothrappali And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.
mike_massimino That was funny.
howard_wolowitz Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.
mike_massimino You know you’re gonna have to go through survival training again.
howard_wolowitz Really?
howard_wolowitz You’ve got to get me out of this.
dr_dreyfus What do you want me to do? You’re perfectly healthy.
howard_wolowitz Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.
debbie_wolowitz Hello?
howard_wolowitz Hi, Ma. How are you?
debbie_wolowitz How I am is not dead, but you wouldn’t know that, because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone.
howard_wolowitz Go, go, go.
debbie_wolowitz For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That’s what happened to your Aunt Ida.
dr_dreyfus Wow.
raj_koothrappali Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.
howard_wolowitz Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.
leonard_hofstadter But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
howard_wolowitz Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.
penny You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…
howard_wolowitz Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.
penny Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, it’s fun up here.
leonard_hofstadter So why are you trying to ruin it?
sheldon_cooper No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad.
bernadette_rostenkowski Now I feel bad.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
penny Yeah, let’s go.
leonard_hofstadter But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.
penny Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh?
raj_koothrappali Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.
raj_koothrappali Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
howard_wolowitz You mean tings like moo-stache?
sheldon_cooper Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
