sheldon_cooper I've been thinking about time travel again.
leonard_hofstadter Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
sheldon_cooper Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I'd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.
leonard_hofstadter Interesting.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?
sheldon_cooper It's time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.
leonard_hofstadter Then I guess congratulations are in order.
sheldon_cooper No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I'm not going to enjoy this party.
leonard_hofstadter I know, I'm familiar with you.
sheldon_cooper At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, I was there.
sheldon_cooper You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
sheldon_cooper How's this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.
leonard_hofstadter Mahalo's a nice touch.
sheldon_cooper Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
leonard_hofstadter Interesting, you should lead with that.
raj_koothrappali Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.
leonard_hofstadter You don't have buffets in India?
raj_koothrappali Of course, but it's all Indian food. You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.
sheldon_cooper Well here's an interesting turn of events.
leonard_hofstadter What. Howard brought a date?
sheldon_cooper A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
howard_wolowitz Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer.
summer I already told you, touching's extra.
howard_wolowitz Right. Sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Here comes our new boss, be polite.
dr_eric_gablehauser Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.
howard_wolowitz Howard Wolowitz.
dr_eric_gablehauser Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?
sheldon_cooper An actual real scientist. How was that?
sheldon_cooper I can't believe he fired me.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
sheldon_cooper In my defence, I prefaced that by saying 'with all due respect.'
leonard_hofstadter Morning
sheldon_cooper Morning.
leonard_hofstadter You're making eggs for breakfast?
sheldon_cooper This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.
leonard_hofstadter Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
sheldon_cooper I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
sheldon_cooper As do I.
leonard_hofstadter You know, I'm sure if you just apologized to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
sheldon_cooper I don't want my job back. I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
sheldon_cooper I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.
leonard_hofstadter And we all thank you.
sheldon_cooper Use new eggs.
penny Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?
sheldon_cooper Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
penny I'm sorry?
sheldon_cooper I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
penny Four dozen?
sheldon_cooper Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.
penny Okay, one more time?
sheldon_cooper Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.
penny Oh, yay!
penny How come you didn't go into work today.
sheldon_cooper I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds.
penny So you got canned, huh?
sheldon_cooper Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
penny Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.
sheldon_cooper No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.
penny No, no, I meant...
sheldon_cooper Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
penny Never mind.
sheldon_cooper Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.
penny We're fine.
sheldon_cooper Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
penny Oh, sure I am.
sheldon_cooper No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let's say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.
penny 120?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
penny Well, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let's say, 4,400lb.
penny Let's say 4,390.
sheldon_cooper Fine. We're travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and... oh look, they built a new put-put course.
sheldon_cooper This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.
penny Thank you.
sheldon_cooper No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.
penny Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs.
sheldon_cooper Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.
penny Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.
sheldon_cooper No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit.
penny Interesting.
sheldon_cooper Isn't it?
penny No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
sheldon_cooper Oh boy.
penny What now?
sheldon_cooper Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.
penny Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
sheldon_cooper Well then you'll want some manganese.
sheldon_cooper That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
penny Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.
penny You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
sheldon_cooper Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?
penny Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we're talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? Okay, no warehouse store, but we're still on for put-put golf, right?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.
sheldon_cooper I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
leonard_hofstadter What's with the fish?
sheldon_cooper It's an experiment.
leonard_hofstadter What happened to your scrambled egg research?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.
leonard_hofstadter So... fish.
sheldon_cooper I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.
leonard_hofstadter Fish nightlights.
sheldon_cooper It's a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
leonard_hofstadter Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologize to Gablehauser and get your job back.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, no. No, I've too much to do.
leonard_hofstadter Like luminous fish.
sheldon_cooper Shhhhh!
leonard_hofstadter Right... I didn't...
sheldon_cooper That's just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we're going to be rich.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you for coming on such short notice.
mary_cooper You did the right thing calling.
leonard_hofstadter I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession. This is a particularly disturbing one.
sheldon_cooper Mommy.
mary_cooper Hi baby.
sheldon_cooper You called my mother?
mary_cooper Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
mary_cooper Honey, why did you get a loom?
sheldon_cooper I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?
mary_cooper Leonard called me.
sheldon_cooper I know, but why?
leonard_hofstadter Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
sheldon_cooper This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother.
leonard_hofstadter Really, when was the last time you left the house.
sheldon_cooper I went to the market with Penny.
leonard_hofstadter That was three weeks ago.
sheldon_cooper Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.
mary_cooper Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.
sheldon_cooper Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother.
leonard_hofstadter Where are you going?
sheldon_cooper To my room, and no-one's allowed in.
mary_cooper He gets his temper from his daddy.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
mary_cooper He's got my eyes.
leonard_hofstadter I see.
mary_cooper All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Your mom made dinner.
sheldon_cooper I'm not hungry.
mary_cooper Oh, Leonard, don't trouble yourself, he's stubborn. He may stay in there 'til the Rapture.
penny Are we so sure that's a bad thing?
mary_cooper I'll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.
howard_wolowitz Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.
mary_cooper Oh, honey that ain't going to work, but you keep trying. I made chicken, I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it's a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it.
leonard_hofstadter That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?
mary_cooper Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds like a wise man.
mary_cooper Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.
penny Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
mary_cooper Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it's against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.
penny What happened?
mary_cooper Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.
leonard_hofstadter A death ray?
mary_cooper Well, that's what he called it, didn't even slow down the neighbor kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple.
leonard_hofstadter No, we're not, we're not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that... are friends.
mary_cooper Did I pluck a nerve there?
howard_wolowitz Oh yeah.
mary_cooper Okay. Alright everybody, it's time to eat. Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. Now after a moment of silent meditation I'm going to end with 'In Jesus' Name' but you two don't feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.
penny Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had.
mary_cooper It was always Sheldon' s favorite. You know what the secret ingredient is?
penny Love?
mary_cooper Lard.
howard_wolowitz Hey, look who's come out...
mary_cooper Shhh! You'll spook him. He's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You're a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room.
mary_cooper You don't hunt, do you?
mary_cooper Good morning, snicker-doodle.
sheldon_cooper Morning.
mary_cooper Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?
sheldon_cooper It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
mary_cooper But intelligently designed by a creator, right?
sheldon_cooper What do you want, mom?
mary_cooper You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
sheldon_cooper Yeah.
mary_cooper Well, I'm done fishing. You put those on.
sheldon_cooper What for?
mary_cooper Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologize to your boss, and get your job back.
sheldon_cooper No.
mary_cooper I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words 'if it please your highness?'
sheldon_cooper I'm not going to apologize, I didn't say anything that wasn't true.
mary_cooper Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out.
sheldon_cooper Why not?
mary_cooper Because people don't like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids? Now let's get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off.
sheldon_cooper Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
mary_cooper Problem solved.
leonard_hofstadter Really? That's impressive.
mary_cooper Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.
mary_cooper Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?
dr_eric_gablehauser Well, actually...
mary_cooper Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here.
sheldon_cooper Dr Gablehouser.
dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Cooper.
mary_cooper Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.
sheldon_cooper Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.
dr_eric_gablehauser I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.
mary_cooper Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.
dr_eric_gablehauser Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager.
mary_cooper Oh, aren't you sweet, his father's dead.
dr_eric_gablehauser Recently?
mary_cooper Long enough.
dr_eric_gablehauser Please. Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?
sheldon_cooper Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how did it go?
sheldon_cooper I got my job back.
leonard_hofstadter Really? What happened?
sheldon_cooper I'm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
leonard_hofstadter That narrows it down.
mary_cooper I'm very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.
sheldon_cooper Thanks, mom. Mom?
mary_cooper Mmm-hmm?
sheldon_cooper Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
mary_cooper We'll see. Sleep tight.
