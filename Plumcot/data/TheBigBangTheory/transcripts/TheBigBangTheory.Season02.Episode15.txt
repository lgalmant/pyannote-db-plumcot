penny Fellas, please.
howard_wolowitz Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.
penny You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
leonard_hofstadter I’m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.
penny What’s that about?
howard_wolowitz Not a clue.
leonard_hofstadter Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
sheldon_cooper This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.
leonard_hofstadter No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
sheldon_cooper He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
leonard_hofstadter Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable.
sheldon_cooper Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.
howard_wolowitz How about that, you were right.
penny It’s out of order.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 Yes, I can read the sign, I’m just pondering the implications.
penny I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.
penny You must be Leonard’s mother.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I don’t know if I must be, but yes.
penny Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.
penny Oh, nice to meet you.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, you’re a hand shaker. Interesting.
penny Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?
penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
dr_beverly_hofstadter All right, you start.
penny Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I think you mean young. He’s always been little.
penny Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
dr_beverly_hofstadter You’ll have to be more specific.
penny Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.
penny Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.
penny Oh, well, I’m an actress.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Why?
penny What do you mean why?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.
penny Yeah, I don’t know what that means.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.
penny Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Tell me about it.
penny I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!
dr_beverly_hofstadter And then, I’m assuming, you entered adolescence.
penny Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!
dr_beverly_hofstadter If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.
leonard_hofstadter Good to see you, Mother.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s your tea, Mother.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oolong?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Loose, not bagged?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Steeped three minutes?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Two-percent milk?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Warmed separately?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter One teaspoon sugar?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Raw sugar?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
dr_beverly_hofstadter It’s cold.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll start again.
sheldon_cooper I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
sheldon_cooper That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Yes, we think so. We’ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.
sheldon_cooper Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, it’s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
sheldon_cooper The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
leonard_hofstadter Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m sorry, it’s on my other laptop.
sheldon_cooper Aw…
leonard_hofstadter So, Mother, what’s new?
dr_beverly_hofstadter You’ll have to be more specific.
leonard_hofstadter All right. Uh, what’s new with you?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, well, I’ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe something less personal.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God. What happened?
dr_beverly_hofstadter His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.
sheldon_cooper What a remarkable woman.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
sheldon_cooper I envy you your childhood.
leonard_hofstadter I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
sheldon_cooper You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
sheldon_cooper You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.
howard_wolowitz So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.
leonard_hofstadter Please, don’t go there, Howard.
howard_wolowitz I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields.
leonard_hofstadter Boy, you suck.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, Leonard’s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.
howard_wolowitz So, she’s close to curing diabetes?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?
howard_wolowitz Wow, you must be very proud.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Why? They’re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you doing this?
howard_wolowitz You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
howard_wolowitz Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.
leonard_hofstadter You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
raj_koothrappali Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.
howard_wolowitz Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?
leonard_hofstadter That was fast.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I’ll have to try again later.
sheldon_cooper It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location.
dr_beverly_hofstadter So, where were we?
leonard_hofstadter Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
dr_beverly_hofstadter That’s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché.
howard_wolowitz It’s just temporary, I pay rent.
leonard_hofstadter He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
dr_beverly_hofstadter You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.
howard_wolowitz Say what? That’s basically what I just said.
leonard_hofstadter You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Leonard, it’s one o’clock, weren’t you going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock?
leonard_hofstadter There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
dr_beverly_hofstadter But it’s one o’clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock.
sheldon_cooper Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
dr_beverly_hofstadter So, no original research?
leonard_hofstadter No.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, what’s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.
howard_wolowitz Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.
raj_koothrappali Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?
howard_wolowitz Why is it always my responsibility?
raj_koothrappali It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
howard_wolowitz I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
raj_koothrappali I didn’t bring it up. You did.
howard_wolowitz We’ll talk about this later.
raj_koothrappali You always say that, but we never do.
sheldon_cooper You went to the comic book store without me.7
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter You got alcohol?
penny Your mom still here?
leonard_hofstadter Yep.
penny Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
penny Oh, my God. What happened?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
penny Geez, what a fun couple.
leonard_hofstadter She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
penny Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.
leonard_hofstadter You can’t let her get into your head.
penny My head, what about yours?
leonard_hofstadter It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
penny She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.
penny I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?
leonard_hofstadter Did you get the part?
penny No, they said I was too perky.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
penny Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me.
leonard_hofstadter Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
penny A hugging machine?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
penny Oh, that is so sad.
leonard_hofstadter You know what the saddest part was?
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter My father used to borrow it.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.
sheldon_cooper I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Common complaint among men. Nothing’s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.
sheldon_cooper I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I’ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I can’t believe that.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.
sheldon_cooper My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Understandable.
sheldon_cooper Can I make you a cup of tea?
dr_beverly_hofstadter I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it’s probably you.
sheldon_cooper I feel very comfortable around you.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I feel very comfortable around you, too.
sheldon_cooper It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Nor I.
sheldon_cooper What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?
sheldon_cooper I’d like to do the math.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’d like that, too.
penny Okay, now this time…
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
penny You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.
penny Neck, shot, lime. Okay, shot, lime.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Ah! Where’s the lime? Oh, okay, we’re sharing.
sheldon_cooper So, what do you think?
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m very tempted. I’m just not sure it’s appropriate with my son’s roommate.
sheldon_cooper Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.
dr_beverly_hofstadter True. I’ve had a similar observation. It’s certainly something I could never do with my husband.
sheldon_cooper I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I see what you’re doing. You’re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.
sheldon_cooper You see right through me, don’t you?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Only when you’re in a CAT scanner.
leonard_hofstadter This is actually gonna happen.
penny Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
leonard_hofstadter You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children.
penny Why would you bring that up right now?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Foreplay?
penny So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?
leonard_hofstadter Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”
penny That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that.
penny Get out!
leonard_hofstadter She said shush. I should have shushed.
leonard_hofstadter All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.
dr_beverly_hofstadter That’s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes
penny Oh, good morning.
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
penny Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t have to. Ever.
penny Gotcha.
leonard_hofstadter Good-bye, Mother.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?
penny I mean, my mom could’ve just said, “Bob, get over it, she’s a girl, move on.” But she didn’t. Not one word.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?
penny Would it help?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, it would help me.
