raj_koothrappali I’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.
sheldon_cooper Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
raj_koothrappali Oh, you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
sheldon_cooper You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
howard_wolowitz I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
raj_koothrappali Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny? Penny?
penny What’s up?
sheldon_cooper Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
howard_wolowitz No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.
penny Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
penny You want the fruit platter?
leonard_hofstadter Does it have melon on it?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter No, I can’t eat melon.
penny Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
leonard_hofstadter When was the last time you saw her?
howard_wolowitz Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? .
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
raj_koothrappali It’s one of his best moves.
howard_wolowitz So, my dear, we meet again.
katee_sackhoff Hello, Howard. I’ve missed you.
howard_wolowitz I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.
katee_sackhoff One question.
howard_wolowitz Anything.
katee_sackhoff Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?
howard_wolowitz Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.
katee_sackhoff Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.
howard_wolowitz Okay, if you insist.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, have you seen my girdle?!
howard_wolowitz No, Ma!
debbie_wolowitz I can’t find it, and I’m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!
howard_wolowitz Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?
bernadette_rostenkowski I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
howard_wolowitz Bernadette? What are you doing here?
katee_sackhoff Well, if I had to guess, I’d say I’m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you’re still hung up on me.
howard_wolowitz No, I’m not.
bernadette_rostenkowski Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m a little confused here.
george_takei Oh, my. Can I help?
howard_wolowitz Not that kind of confused.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s George Takei doing here?
katee_sackhoff Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?
howard_wolowitz No, of course not.
george_takei So you say. Yet, here I am.
katee_sackhoff George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?
george_takei It’s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O’Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.
katee_sackhoff Tell me about it. It’s frackin’ frustrating.
howard_wolowitz Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!
howard_wolowitz Great, Ma!
debbie_wolowitz I think it shrunk! I’m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
howard_wolowitz And with that mental picture, I think we’re done for the evening.
leonard_hofstadter You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.
howard_wolowitz I did a stupid thing.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I guessed that.
howard_wolowitz It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
leonard_hofstadter That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.
howard_wolowitz No. Stop asking.
leonard_hofstadter All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.
howard_wolowitz In a nutshell.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.
howard_wolowitz Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not.
raj_koothrappali You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
sheldon_cooper Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
raj_koothrappali You have a desk.
sheldon_cooper Correct.
raj_koothrappali But I can’t have one.
sheldon_cooper You’re two for two.
leonard_hofstadter Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
raj_koothrappali Oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
howard_wolowitz Okay, what if he buys his own desk?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?
sheldon_cooper That’s ridiculous.
howard_wolowitz Why?
sheldon_cooper Because…
raj_koothrappali Yes?
sheldon_cooper It’s my office.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
raj_koothrappali And I can put it in your office?
sheldon_cooper Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?
leonard_hofstadter Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
sheldon_cooper They do some of their best work at night.
penny Ah, it’s okay.
sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny?
howard_wolowitz Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
penny Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
howard_wolowitz I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
penny Oh, absolutely.
howard_wolowitz She does?
penny Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?
howard_wolowitz She saw that, huh?
penny Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.
howard_wolowitz Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
penny Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I’d rather not say.
penny Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened.
howard_wolowitz But it’s embarrassing.
penny Yeah, that’s what I’m counting on. Spill.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?
penny Um, the online game? Sure.
howard_wolowitz Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?
penny Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.
howard_wolowitz Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
penny Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing.
howard_wolowitz Would you talk to her?
penny Bernadette or the troll?
howard_wolowitz Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story.
penny Well, what was your side?
howard_wolowitz Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.
penny Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?
howard_wolowitz Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?
penny Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.
howard_wolowitz No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.
penny Okay, I will think about it.
howard_wolowitz You know, I’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn’t the son he wanted.
penny Yeah, I said I’d think about it.
howard_wolowitz I wasn’t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.
penny Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
sheldon_cooper One question.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
sheldon_cooper Why on earth are you telling me all this?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy.
raj_koothrappali You said I could buy a desk.
sheldon_cooper This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
raj_koothrappali Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?
sheldon_cooper It’s actually British.
raj_koothrappali Can you say it again for me?
sheldon_cooper Brobdingnagian.
raj_koothrappali One more time?
sheldon_cooper Brobdingnagian.
raj_koothrappali Now three times fast?
sheldon_cooper Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?
raj_koothrappali That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
sheldon_cooper All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.
sheldon_cooper All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you.
raj_koothrappali Knock yourself out.
sheldon_cooper Help me move my desk.
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
raj_koothrappali No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
sheldon_cooper Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
raj_koothrappali Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I’d say it’s spot-on.
sheldon_cooper All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Stand by for my upcoming tat.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yes?
raj_koothrappali No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry, I had to clock out.
howard_wolowitz Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?
howard_wolowitz Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I’m terrified of the ocean.
bernadette_rostenkowski Too bad.
howard_wolowitz You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, to be honest, I…
penny Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?
howard_wolowitz Not for me, thanks.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m okay.
penny Are you gonna want to order food?
howard_wolowitz Maybe later.
penny Okay.
howard_wolowitz So, are you seeing anybody?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
penny That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s fine.
howard_wolowitz Penny, can we have a little privacy?
penny Oh. I’m sorry.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
howard_wolowitz Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…
bernadette_rostenkowski So you’ve been seeing other girls?
howard_wolowitz Well, not real girls.
bernadette_rostenkowski Does that mean slutty trolls?
penny You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
penny It’s passion fruit, new on the menu.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know. I work here.
penny Oh, sorry. Yeah, you’re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?
howard_wolowitz Isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
penny Not where I can hear you guys.
howard_wolowitz Okay, fine. I’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I’ve ever gone there is because I don’t have a real woman in my life. You happy?
penny Yeah, that’ll hold me for a while.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…
bernadette_rostenkowski Had sex?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, whose fault was that?
penny Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
howard_wolowitz What do you mean, whose fault was that?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move.
howard_wolowitz I didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski Really.
howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch.
penny Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you’re ready.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?
howard_wolowitz Did Penny tell you about that?
leonard_hofstadter No. Steve Patterson told me.
howard_wolowitz The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz How’d he know about it?
leonard_hofstadter He’s Glissinda the troll.
raj_koothrappali Sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!
sheldon_cooper I’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
raj_koothrappali Oh, too bad! Sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!
sheldon_cooper That’s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
raj_koothrappali Eat flaming Nerf!
leonard_hofstadter So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I think I’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
leonard_hofstadter Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf.
howard_wolowitz Short jokes? Really? You’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, and don’t you forget it.
howard_wolowitz I had a good time.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too.
katee_sackhoff Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.
george_takei Hold on there. We’ve only just rekindled the romance. Let’s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.
katee_sackhoff Don’t listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.
george_takei Mm-mmm. Too soon.
katee_sackhoff Trust me, she’s ready. Make the move.
george_takei No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.
katee_sackhoff How would you know?
george_takei I read.
katee_sackhoff Listen to me, Howard, it’s time. Make the move, now.
bernadette_rostenkowski Mm! What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz You said, well, the move, remember?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, not now. We’re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.
howard_wolowitz No, you don’t. It’s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.
