penny Hey. So you guys ready to order?
sheldon_cooper Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?
penny Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?
penny Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend.
sheldon_cooper Probably serving food that was ordered today.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
penny The what?
leonard_hofstadter It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
penny Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.
amy_farrah_fowler Shame. Since you’re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.
penny I’m your best friend?
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t you read my blog?
penny Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
penny No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?
leonard_hofstadter I think her weekend just opened up.
penny Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?
leonard_hofstadter Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
penny You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.
amy_farrah_fowler Please don’t touch my breasts.
penny I, I wasn’t going to.
amy_farrah_fowler All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
penny Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages.
sheldon_cooper In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.
penny You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.
amy_farrah_fowler That does seem to be a valid principle.
sheldon_cooper I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t believe there’s any such thing.
sheldon_cooper You lied to me?
sheldon_cooper Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.
sheldon_cooper Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder.
howard_wolowitz Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
sheldon_cooper All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.
penny Yay!
sheldon_cooper She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.
penny Brawny?
leonard_hofstadter They’re bigger than mine.
sheldon_cooper Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.
howard_wolowitz Fine. Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
sheldon_cooper It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
howard_wolowitz Still right behind you.
sheldon_cooper Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.
penny So, Amy, I’ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
amy_farrah_fowler No, we discussed it. We decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.
sheldon_cooper Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
leonard_hofstadter I can vouch for that.
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Not you, him.
penny Oh. Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Although yours was an eye-opener.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry, Penny. You’re my plus-one. You’ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I’m the ideal hotel roommate.
penny Terrific. Are we there yet?
bernadette_rostenkowski I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
howard_wolowitz Really? You want to see the keynote?
howard_wolowitz Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? And miss the keynote?
howard_wolowitz We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?
howard_wolowitz No, see, it’s not…
bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Thank you, Raj.
leonard_hofstadter Are you an element in the actinoid series?
sheldon_cooper No. Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
sheldon_cooper No.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you in the lanthanoid series?
sheldon_cooper Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?
penny Uh, I don’t know. Are you food?
sheldon_cooper That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
penny Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?
sheldon_cooper I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
penny Who elected you Road Trip God?
sheldon_cooper Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor.
sheldon_cooper Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
penny I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?
penny I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
howard_wolowitz What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. It’s the Love Car.
penny Should I ask?
bernadette_rostenkowski They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow.
howard_wolowitz Well, I don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…
penny Red Leader, I’m really sorry.
bernadette_rostenkowski@howard_wolowitz I got you, babe.
amy_farrah_fowler I missed you.
penny You know what? I missed you, too.
very_tall_and_powerfully_built_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 Bernadette?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, Glenn!
glenn Great to see you!
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you here for the conference?
glenn Yeah, I’m doing a global warming panel.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.
glenn Oh. Nice to meet you.
howard_wolowitz Hi. Ow. Hi.
glenn You’re a lucky man. Bernie’s a great gal.
howard_wolowitz Yes. Bernie sure is.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll try to catch it.
glenn Oh, great. Bye.
bernadette_rostenkowski Bye.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah?
howard_wolowitz Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
bernadette_rostenkowski No. He was one of my professors in college.
howard_wolowitz Oh! That’s a relief.
bernadette_rostenkowski Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.
howard_wolowitz No, it’s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!
howard_wolowitz That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
howard_wolowitz No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?
bernadette_rostenkowski Six-seven.
howard_wolowitz Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
bernadette_rostenkowski Is something bothering you?
howard_wolowitz No. It’s just…
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?
bernadette_rostenkowski You can’t think that way.
howard_wolowitz Yep. Loser.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, stop it.
howard_wolowitz Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?
howard_wolowitz I’m… I…
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
howard_wolowitz No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, let’s go with that.
amy_farrah_fowler Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.
penny Will do.
amy_farrah_fowler So, girl talk?
penny Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
amy_farrah_fowler Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
penny Um, I never really thought about it. Why?
amy_farrah_fowler Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
penny Really?
amy_farrah_fowler Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.
penny Again, I’ve never given it much thought.
amy_farrah_fowler We have time now. Think about it.
penny Oh, good. Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Can I stay here tonight?
penny Yeah. Why, what happened?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard’s a complete and total ass.
penny Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.
amy_farrah_fowler Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
penny We are?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course, we’re best friends.
penny Oh, right, right, the blog.
amy_farrah_fowler Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine.
penny Hey, can I stay here tonight?
leonard_hofstadter Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
penny Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure.
penny All right.
leonard_hofstadter So, how do you wanna do this?
penny Well, I’m not getting in bed with him.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin.
penny We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, when you say make the best of it.
penny Sleep.
leonard_hofstadter Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
penny The what?
leonard_hofstadter Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.
penny Oh, okay. Just like old times.
leonard_hofstadter Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.
penny Sweetie, let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.
leonard_hofstadter Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?
penny Go to sleep.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
sheldon_cooper Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
penny We are not having coitus.
sheldon_cooper Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
penny Yes.
leonard_hofstadter No.
announcer Next on Turner Classic Movies, Bridget Jones’s Diary.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, I’m crying already.
sheldon_cooper Raj? Raj? Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
raj_koothrappali Why?
sheldon_cooper Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Come on in.
penny Leonard, are you asleep?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, no problem.
penny I know it’s kinda weird.
leonard_hofstadter True dat.
penny True dat?
leonard_hofstadter I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
penny Right. Still mad at me about that?
leonard_hofstadter No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
penny Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, good night.
penny Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!
raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s here. No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!
sheldon_cooper Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.
howard_wolowitz Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
amy_farrah_fowler Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.
sheldon_cooper Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?
raj_koothrappali Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.
leonard_hofstadter I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
raj_koothrappali What did I do?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
raj_koothrappali I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
penny We weren’t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
penny Oh, shut up, Sheldon!
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, bestie.
penny Yeah, hi.
sheldon_cooper All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic.
howard_wolowitz Let me ask you something, Bernie.
sheldon_cooper I guess not.
howard_wolowitz How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
howard_wolowitz What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
raj_koothrappali I’d like to weigh in here. No.
sheldon_cooper All right, why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?
penny Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?
glenn I’m driving back to L.A. tonight.
bernadette_rostenkowski Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny.
leonard_hofstadter No!
sheldon_cooper Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal.
sheldon_cooper Must be out of range.
amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, can I ask you a question?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?
leonard_hofstadter No. Why do you ask?
amy_farrah_fowler Because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
sheldon_cooper All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.
