sheldon_cooper Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
leonard_hofstadter It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
sheldon_cooper Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
sheldon_cooper What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer.
raj_koothrappali Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
sheldon_cooper Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Uh-uh.
raj_koothrappali We’re good.
sheldon_cooper 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?
leonard_hofstadter We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
sheldon_cooper Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.
raj_koothrappali Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.
leonard_hofstadter Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I get it now.
penny I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?
penny Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.
zack_johnson Hey, Penny, how’s it going?
penny Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?
zack_johnson My dad’s company prints the menus for this place. I’m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ’em easier to clean if people throw up on ’em. Guess how I got the idea?
penny Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
zack_johnson Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler Hoo.
zack_johnson Okay, well, it was good to see you.
penny Yeah, you, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s really cute. How do you know him?
penny Oh, we went out a couple of times.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
penny No, no. But in this case, yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
penny No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level.
bernadette_rostenkowski Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
penny Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.
amy_farrah_fowler Hoo.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s the matter?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.
penny Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.
howard_wolowitz Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
leonard_hofstadter No. What happened?
howard_wolowitz They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
raj_koothrappali Did he get superpowers?
howard_wolowitz No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.
raj_koothrappali Oh. Well, that’s disappointing.
howard_wolowitz Why?
raj_koothrappali Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?
raj_koothrappali Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.
howard_wolowitz Mouse Boy?
raj_koothrappali You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?
howard_wolowitz First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick.
raj_koothrappali Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, Leonard, who?
leonard_hofstadter 12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table.
sheldon_cooper Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine.
sheldon_cooper Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.
amy_farrah_fowler Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.
sheldon_cooper Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.
amy_farrah_fowler No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour.
sheldon_cooper I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that sounds like fun.
sheldon_cooper All right. What were the symptoms?
amy_farrah_fowler Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.
sheldon_cooper Localized to what region?
amy_farrah_fowler Ears and genitalia.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
amy_farrah_fowler I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.
sheldon_cooper Who?
amy_farrah_fowler Zack.
sheldon_cooper Then why did you ask?
amy_farrah_fowler Ask what?
sheldon_cooper Who.
amy_farrah_fowler Zack.
sheldon_cooper All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
amy_farrah_fowler Hoo.
sheldon_cooper Zack.
amy_farrah_fowler Why do you keep saying Zack?
sheldon_cooper Because you keep saying who.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
sheldon_cooper And the answer was Zack, correct?
amy_farrah_fowler There was no question. I simply said hoo.
sheldon_cooper All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.
amy_farrah_fowler Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
howard_wolowitz There you are.
raj_koothrappali Oh, hey.
howard_wolowitz Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do.
howard_wolowitz No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.
raj_koothrappali Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…
howard_wolowitz Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!
raj_koothrappali What the heck is this?
howard_wolowitz A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.
raj_koothrappali Are you crazy?
howard_wolowitz Perhaps. Are you scared?
raj_koothrappali No. But it’s a stupid test.
howard_wolowitz Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.
raj_koothrappali All right, I will.
howard_wolowitz How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
raj_koothrappali It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
howard_wolowitz Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!
amy_farrah_fowler My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
sheldon_cooper How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
amy_farrah_fowler I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack.
sheldon_cooper Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
sheldon_cooper A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.
amy_farrah_fowler Religion?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
sheldon_cooper Cheap science fiction?
amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
amy_farrah_fowler Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
sheldon_cooper I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it.
amy_farrah_fowler And?
sheldon_cooper I reject it.
amy_farrah_fowler You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?
sheldon_cooper I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.
sheldon_cooper Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?
sheldon_cooper The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right.
penny That’s thinking ahead.
sheldon_cooper The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
penny So how’s Amy?
sheldon_cooper Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
penny Oh, no. Why?
sheldon_cooper I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.
penny Just going to skip over that insult.
sheldon_cooper What insult?
penny Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the
sheldon_cooper Forget science. She’s horny.
penny Oh! Okay. Wow.
sheldon_cooper It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
penny Are you sure?
sheldon_cooper What are you suggesting?
penny I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?
sheldon_cooper It’s illegal to spay a human being.
penny Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
penny Exactly.
sheldon_cooper Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.
penny Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.
sheldon_cooper Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin.
leonard_hofstadter Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
howard_wolowitz You got a better idea?
leonard_hofstadter Every idea is better than this idea.
howard_wolowitz Ding!
raj_koothrappali Wait. What the hell is ding?
howard_wolowitz It’s a bell.
raj_koothrappali I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
howard_wolowitz Fine. How do you want to start?
raj_koothrappali I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?
howard_wolowitz One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.
raj_koothrappali Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?
howard_wolowitz That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.
howard_wolowitz Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?
raj_koothrappali What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.
howard_wolowitz All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.
raj_koothrappali Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…
howard_wolowitz We’re starting now!
raj_koothrappali Don’t yell at me!
leonard_hofstadter Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
sheldon_cooper Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sure it’ll wash off.
sheldon_cooper Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
amy_farrah_fowler There’s Zack.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure this is what you want to do?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do.
sheldon_cooper Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
sheldon_cooper Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs.
zack_johnson My gluteus what?
amy_farrah_fowler On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.
zack_johnson Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.
howard_wolowitz I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!
raj_koothrappali No, uh-uh, you’re going down!
howard_wolowitz If anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you.
leonard_hofstadter Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
sheldon_cooper I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
amy_farrah_fowler As am I.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
amy_farrah_fowler An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
raj_koothrappali You realize you can’t win.
howard_wolowitz I prefer to think that I can’t lose.
raj_koothrappali You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
howard_wolowitz You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch Rat-Man?
raj_koothrappali Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
howard_wolowitz You narcissistic nincompoop!
raj_koothrappali You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips.
