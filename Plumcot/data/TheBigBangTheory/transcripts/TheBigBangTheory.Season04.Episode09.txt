raj_koothrappali You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
howard_wolowitz You want to talk brave, how about Captain America’s undocumented Mexican gardener?
leonard_hofstadter He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
sheldon_cooper As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
howard_wolowitz How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
sheldon_cooper Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
raj_koothrappali Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
howard_wolowitz That’s a stupid question.
raj_koothrappali We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 Yes?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, um, is Penny here?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 You’re Leonard, right?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 Damn, it’s good to finally meet you, son.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.
penny Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good. Context.
pennys_dad#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.
penny Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I’ll see you later. Bye.
leonard_hofstadter That was odd.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.
raj_koothrappali Is that racist? It feels racist.
howard_wolowitz Don’t be oversensitive. He’s calling you illiterate, not your race.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
sheldon_cooper I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.
howard_wolowitz Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.
leonard_hofstadter You’ll never guess what just happened.
sheldon_cooper You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Aw.
leonard_hofstadter Penny kissed me.
sheldon_cooper Well, who would ever guess that?
raj_koothrappali What… what kind of a kiss?
leonard_hofstadter A big kiss. On the mouth.
howard_wolowitz Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
leonard_hofstadter She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.
leonard_hofstadter You think?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
leonard_hofstadter Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
sheldon_cooper Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
leonard_hofstadter I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.
howard_wolowitz Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.
leonard_hofstadter Why do I bother talking to you people?
sheldon_cooper If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.
penny Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
sheldon_cooper I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
penny So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
leonard_hofstadter What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.
penny Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.
leonard_hofstadter What? Why?
penny Well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.
leonard_hofstadter What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
penny Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.
leonard_hofstadter Really? How, how’d we manage that?
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
penny Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I don’t think so.
penny Okay, why are you arguing about this?
leonard_hofstadter I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened.
penny Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?
leonard_hofstadter Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that.
pennys_dad#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 Penny, you out here?
penny Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.
pennys_dad#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 Relax, I’ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.
leonard_hofstadter See? He doesn’t mind.
pennys_dad#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 So, Leonard, I’m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?
penny Oh, dad, that’s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Come here, you.
howard_wolowitz C-7.
raj_koothrappali Miss.
howard_wolowitz How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.
raj_koothrappali Not if it has a hole in the middle.
howard_wolowitz What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
raj_koothrappali A Romulan battle bagel?
bernadette_rostenkowski Knock-knock.
howard_wolowitz Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.
bernadette_rostenkowski So where’s the telescope?
howard_wolowitz It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.
bernadette_rostenkowski So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?
howard_wolowitz I did it with you when we rented The Notebook. Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me. I can’t be drinking, I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here.
howard_wolowitz What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
raj_koothrappali How do you know that?
howard_wolowitz Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption.
raj_koothrappali Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I, I’m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.
raj_koothrappali Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
howard_wolowitz Yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.
raj_koothrappali I do appreciate that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here we go.
howard_wolowitz Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead.
howard_wolowitz What?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.
pennys_dad#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 My pleasure. It’s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny’s that knows how to use a napkin.
penny So not funny, dad.
wyatt Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.
penny Oh, will you please let it go?
wyatt Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.
leonard_hofstadter A lot of people are doing that.
penny Oh, see?
wyatt Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom’s Camry.
penny Yeah, that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on.
wyatt And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?
penny Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking.
wyatt I don’t know. That petition looked real to me.
penny Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
wyatt Well, I’m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper.
wyatt Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?
penny Oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe I could go in a little late.
penny No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important.
wyatt Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won’t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t I know it.
wyatt Well, good night, son.
leonard_hofstadter Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.
penny Good night.
leonard_hofstadter I love you.
penny Love you, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.
howard_wolowitz Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can’t go any further. There’s a sacred cow in my way.
raj_koothrappali Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
bernadette_rostenkowski It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Like his haircut material.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?
raj_koothrappali No. I got them all cut.
bernadette_rostenkowski Which is still so funny.
raj_koothrappali And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
bernadette_rostenkowski Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I think that’s enough about me.
raj_koothrappali He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!
leonard_hofstadter Coming. Hey, lovebug.
penny Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?
penny Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
leonard_hofstadter You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful.
penny Why are you making this so difficult?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
penny Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter Well, then, what do you want?
penny I don’t know.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
penny Maybe.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits.
penny Oh, my God. What personal habits?
leonard_hofstadter I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.
penny Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…
leonard_hofstadter Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
sheldon_cooper Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
penny No, you’re right. No, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
sheldon_cooper Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.
leonard_hofstadter Fines?
sheldon_cooper Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.
raj_koothrappali Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!
howard_wolowitz It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?
raj_koothrappali Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion.
bernadette_rostenkowski That sounds great.
raj_koothrappali It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.
howard_wolowitz We’d come visit you.
raj_koothrappali No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?
howard_wolowitz Hold on. He could come back.
raj_koothrappali Oh, what’s the point of everything?
howard_wolowitz Nope. He’s gone.
raj_koothrappali You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
howard_wolowitz What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
raj_koothrappali Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you.
raj_koothrappali Where?
bernadette_rostenkowski You just have to look.
howard_wolowitz No!
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, this was fun.
wyatt Oh! I think I got a nibble.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.
wyatt Oh, look at that baby. They’re really biting, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
wyatt Oh, that’s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn’t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we’re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.
wyatt That’s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing’s bull squirt, huh? Well, that’s very disappointing. Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you.
wyatt I can’t believe you would lie to me like that.
leonard_hofstadter Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.
wyatt I’ll get to you in a minute.
leonard_hofstadter No hurry.
wyatt That my own daughter thinks I don’t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.
penny I’m sorry, daddy…
wyatt Let me finish.
penny Oh.
wyatt I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?
penny You know, I’m sorry.
wyatt You’re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.
penny You’re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.
wyatt Thank you. Now, why don’t you go and put some clothes on and we’ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.
penny Daddy, he had nothing to do…
wyatt Keep walking.
penny Okay.
wyatt Please, please, please don’t give up on her.
leonard_hofstadter What?
wyatt I can’t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.
leonard_hofstadter Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir.
wyatt Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don’t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll give it a shot.
wyatt Thank you. Now I’m going to do something here to help you along.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
wyatt Just don’t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.
wyatt Don’t yap. Just get out.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll friend you on Facebook.
sheldon_cooper Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
sheldon_cooper Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, how’d it go last night?
raj_koothrappali Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.
leonard_hofstadter Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
raj_koothrappali Why? You writing a book?
sheldon_cooper I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.
raj_koothrappali Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
sheldon_cooper That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
howard_wolowitz Whoa. Where did that come from?
raj_koothrappali He never touched my telescope.
howard_wolowitz Way to go shutting up.
raj_koothrappali I did shut up. Now you shut up.
howard_wolowitz Fine.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
