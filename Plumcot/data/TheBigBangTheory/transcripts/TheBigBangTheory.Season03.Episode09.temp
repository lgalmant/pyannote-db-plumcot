howard So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What the heck was all that about?”
bernadette I don’t really get it.
howard Well, see, it took two years for the snail to… not important.
bernadette Can I ask you a question?
howard Sure.
bernadette Where do you think this is going?
howard To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.
bernadette You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian.
howard A Jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new.
bernadette Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.
howard No, I was just… never mind.
bernadette Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.
howard We do?
bernadette Sex.
howard You’re kidding.
bernadette But I need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
howard Okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? It’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?
bernadette Maybe you need to think about it a little.
howard You know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.
bernadette Call me when you figure it out.
howard Three dates means sex? Who knew?
howard Greetings, homies, homette.
penny Why are you back from your date so early?
howard In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.
penny What exactly does that mean?
leonard He struck out.
howard Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?
raj Actually, I’ve never had three dates with the same woman.
leonard With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.
howard Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?
leonard No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
sheldon I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?
leonard The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
sheldon I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?
leonard Never mind, what’s your announcement?
sheldon Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…
kripke Hey, Cooper, I hear you’re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.
sheldon Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
kripke My pweasure.
sheldon My thank you was not sincere.
kripke But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don’t answer, it’s wetowical.
sheldon Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
leonard Are you really going to be on NPR?
sheldon Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
leonard Very cool, congratulations.
sheldon Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.
sheldon All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
howard Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
sheldon Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
leonard You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it.
raj In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.
penny Hi, guys.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
penny Yo, Raj, talk to me. I’m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven’t you called Bernadette?
howard Did she say something?
penny Yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?
howard I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure she’s my type.
penny She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
howard Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.
penny Different how?
howard Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
penny Are you high?
leonard You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
howard Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.
penny Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?
howard Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to.
leonard Excuse me, I’m sitting here.
penny Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.
leonard Again, I’m right here.
penny My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.
leonard I am here, right? You see me.
howard Hey, I’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? Yes, you’re delicious caramel, too.
penny All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s wrong…
sheldon Excuse me, may I interject?
penny What?
sheldon Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
howard Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
radio This is Ira Flatow and you’re listening to NPR’s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
kripke Oh, this is going to be a wiot.
radio Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon My pleasure, Ira.
ira Now, let’s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?
sheldon Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.
ira Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.
sheldon No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.
sheldon A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!
howard So nice you could join me this evening. You’re looking lovely as always.
katee_sackhoff Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.
howard Come on, Katee, don’t make it sound so cheap.
katee I’m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.
howard Thank you. So, shall we get started?
katee Sure. But can I ask you a question first?
howard You want to play Cylon and colonist?
katee No. I want to know why you’re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.
howard You mean, Bernadette?
katee No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She’s a wonderful girl and she really likes you.
howard I know, but she’s not you.
katee I’m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.
howard Really? Tall?
katee Six-four.
howard Ouch.
katee The point is, you’ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you’re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.
howards_mother Howard! What are you doing in there?
howard I’m taking a bath!
howards_mother I hope that’s all you’re doing! We share that tub!
howard Don’t remind me! Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.
leonard How ya doin’, buddy?
sheldon I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
leonard Come on, it wasn’t that bad.
sheldon What do you want?
raj We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.
leonard Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
sheldon It wasn’t funny.
raj I thought it was funny.
leonard Raj.
raj You laughed.
sheldon Did you laugh?
leonard I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.
sheldon I refuse to sink to his level.
raj You can’t sink. With all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away.
leonard Are you really admitting defeat?
sheldon I never admit defeat.
leonard Good.
sheldon However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.
leonard What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
raj I don’t think that’s possible, dude.
leonard You’re not helping.
raj I didn’t come to help, I came to mock.
leonard Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
raj That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply.
sheldon Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.
leonard No, no.
sheldon It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
leonard Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.
sheldon Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not.
leonard Let’s keep thinking.
penny Oh, gee, you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.
howard Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working today, right?
penny Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you.
howard Why not?
penny Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya.
bernadette Hello, Howard.
howard Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.
bernadette I can’t now, I’m working.
howard This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?
bernadette Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?
howard No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.
bernadette So, this isn’t a joke?
howard No.
bernadette Then you’re insane.
howard I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
bernadette Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even had sex yet.
howard Fair enough. When’s your break?
bernadette Wow.
howard Don’t you just hate when this happens?
penny Wow.
sheldon All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.
raj What’s this?
sheldon Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.
raj Foamy vengeance.
sheldon Yes, exactly.
leonard This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?
sheldon Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
raj Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
sheldon You flatter me, sir.
leonard Let me guess, motion sensors?
sheldon The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.
leonard I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.
sheldon It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
raj Here comes Kripke!
leonard Who is that with him?
raj I believe that’s the president of the university.
leonard And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
sheldon There is no abort.
raj Well, how could you not put in an abort?
sheldon I made a boo-boo, all right?
kripke I think the board will weally appweciate how well we’re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma…
raj Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
leonard At least they don’t know it was you.
sheldon Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.
raj Well, I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?
penny Hey, here’s your tip from table seven.
bernadette Oh, thanks.
penny Mm-hmm.
howard Testing. Check. Check two.
bernadette Oh, now what?
penny You want me to throw him out?
bernadette No, that’s okay.
penny Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.
howard I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve done wrong. Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…
penny Oh, I am so sorry.
bernadette Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
howard …Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
