penny So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?
leonard_hofstadter Wow, you remember that?
penny Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.
leonard_hofstadter You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.
penny And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.
penny Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.
leonard_hofstadter Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?
penny No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…
penny Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.
leonard_hofstadter No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.
penny Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.
leonard_hofstadter Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
sheldon_cooper Hmm.
leonard_hofstadter What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
sheldon_cooper Hmm.
leonard_hofstadter I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?
sheldon_cooper Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers.
leonard_hofstadter No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?
sheldon_cooper It’s good.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
sheldon_cooper I like it. I think you’re on to something.
leonard_hofstadter You do? You’re not messing with me?
sheldon_cooper Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.
leonard_hofstadter You’re giving me a sticker?
sheldon_cooper Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not a preschooler.
sheldon_cooper Fine, I’ll take it back.
leonard_hofstadter I earned this. Back off.
leonard_hofstadter You’re still awake?
sheldon_cooper For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
leonard_hofstadter You worked out all the math.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.
leonard_hofstadter You wrote a paper on my idea?
sheldon_cooper I wrote a paper on our idea.
leonard_hofstadter When did my idea become our idea?
sheldon_cooper When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
leonard_hofstadter This is good. Our idea is really good.
sheldon_cooper Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.
leonard_hofstadter You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.
sheldon_cooper Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you.
leonard_hofstadter Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?
sheldon_cooper We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.
leonard_hofstadter You’re sure it’s good?
sheldon_cooper My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, partner, let’s do it.
sheldon_cooper Come on. Click the mouse with me.
leonard_hofstadter One, two three.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 Click.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we did it.
sheldon_cooper Yes, we did, my friend.
leonard_hofstadter Is your tongue blue?
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to talk about it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?
amy_farrah_fowler Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
penny Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.
bernadette_rostenkowski Search for it.
penny What, no, why?
bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause it would be fun to watch.
penny It would be humiliating.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, now we have two reasons.
amy_farrah_fowler They have it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Please, can we watch it?
amy_farrah_fowler Please?
penny Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you even seen it?
penny No.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.
voice_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 Bananas, get your fresh bananas.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ho-ho, it really didn’t.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.
sheldon_cooper Does it smell like blueberries?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Then we’re probably okay.
howard_wolowitz Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.
leonard_hofstadter Really? What’d they say?
howard_wolowitz Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.
leonard_hofstadter Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.
sheldon_cooper Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?
sheldon_cooper I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.
howard_wolowitz How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?
raj_koothrappali Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
sheldon_cooper Read another one.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
sheldon_cooper Who wrote that?
leonard_hofstadter It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m responding to it.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level.
sheldon_cooper Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this.
sheldon_cooper He just left another comment.
raj_koothrappali What does it say?
leonard_hofstadter Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.
sheldon_cooper Can I respond now?
leonard_hofstadter Do it.
sheldon_cooper You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.
leonard_hofstadter Somebody else do it.
penny Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.
doctor Why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?
penny Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.
penny Okay, we’ve seen plenty.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, give me the remote.
amy_farrah_fowler Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.
penny Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.
amy_farrah_fowler What is it?
penny Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.
amy_farrah_fowler I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.
penny You look like a talking cupcake.
bernadette_rostenkowski And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.
amy_farrah_fowler Play it again. Play it again.
raj_koothrappali Did he respond yet?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. No, not yet.
leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.
howard_wolowitz It wasn’t that bad.
leonard_hofstadter Read it back one more time.
sheldon_cooper My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.
leonard_hofstadter And you don’t think that’s too rough?
sheldon_cooper We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
penny How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause it’s embarrassing.
penny It is; it truly is.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.
penny No.
amy_farrah_fowler Why? What did I do?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.
penny Okay. We are reading that right now.
amy_farrah_fowler No, please don’t.
bernadette_rostenkowski We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.
amy_farrah_fowler But it’s personal.
penny Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
penny Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.
penny Please show us?
bernadette_rostenkowski Please?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
penny You know I’m gonna read it either way.
amy_farrah_fowler Good luck finding it.
penny Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why? Why did it feel different?
penny Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that.
sheldon_cooper He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?
leonard_hofstadter Do you really want him to write back?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?
leonard_hofstadter Me-wow.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
raj_koothrappali I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.
howard_wolowitz This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
raj_koothrappali No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
sheldon_cooper He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
raj_koothrappali Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.
raj_koothrappali See? Better with the accent.
sheldon_cooper And send.
leonard_hofstadter What did you write?
sheldon_cooper I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.
leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
sheldon_cooper I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.
leonard_hofstadter Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.
raj_koothrappali Come on, Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper Oh, okay, okay, calm down. It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, really?
penny “Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking.
penny It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here we go.
penny Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Amelia.
penny So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.
amy_farrah_fowler In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
raj_koothrappali I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
howard_wolowitz Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
leonard_hofstadter Never noticed that about you.
raj_koothrappali You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.
sheldon_cooper He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.
leonard_hofstadter All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished.
sheldon_cooper Click it with me. One, two, three, click.
stephen_hawking Well, hello there.
sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking?
stephen_hawking Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.
leonard_hofstadter You really didn’t like our paper?
stephen_hawking I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.
sheldon_cooper Then why are you attacking us?
stephen_hawking If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you’d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.
leonard_hofstadter Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
sheldon_cooper Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
leonard_hofstadter And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.
howard_wolowitz How do you do, Mr. I’ll-Admit-That’s-Pretty-Cool?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.
penny With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.
bernadette_rostenkowski Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, that’s enough.
penny What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re just making fun of me.
bernadette_rostenkowski I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.
penny No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?
bernadette_rostenkowski Please?
amy_farrah_fowler Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.
bernadette_rostenkowski But they didn’t even kiss.
amy_farrah_fowler She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.
penny Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler “What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…
leonard_hofstadter You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
penny Get out!
bernadette_rostenkowski Not now!
amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 Is the water warm enough?
sheldon_cooper Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it’s a little nippy.
amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 I can fix that. I couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments.
sheldon_cooper They’re not undergarments. They’re Underoos. Where I come from, they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear.
amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 And what’s the significance of the spider?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.
amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 There’s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn’t there?
leonard_hofstadter You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought.
penny You want me to stop reading?
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding? No, no.
penny As he stood for Amelia to dry him…
amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, I’m good.
