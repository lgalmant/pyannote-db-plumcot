leonard_hofstadter I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.
raj_koothrappali I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
howard_wolowitz Only without the sex.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, literally, none of it.
leonard_hofstadter What do you think about it, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Meh.
raj_koothrappali Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
sheldon_cooper Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, you’re jealous.
sheldon_cooper Why would I be jealous?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.
barry_kripke Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.
sheldon_cooper Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
barry_kripke No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.
sheldon_cooper Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.
barry_kripke Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.
sheldon_cooper Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
howard_wolowitz Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
penny Hey, you’re up early.
sheldon_cooper I couldn’t sleep.
penny I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
sheldon_cooper No, that’s not it.
penny Is something bothering you?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.
penny Oh, come on, try me.
sheldon_cooper All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.
penny Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
sheldon_cooper You mean your acting career?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Your relationship with Leonard?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Your failed attempt to go back to college?
penny No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.
sheldon_cooper I said Leonard, you said no.
penny I’m talking about other guys.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Well, what do you do?
penny You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know if I can do that.
penny I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?
sheldon_cooper Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’s dating two women going?
raj_koothrappali Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
howard_wolowitz And?
raj_koothrappali She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you
leonard_hofstadter Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?
raj_koothrappali At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
howard_wolowitz I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
raj_koothrappali Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
howard_wolowitz She is. But I like that attitude.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
raj_koothrappali You’re really going to do this?
sheldon_cooper I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.
howard_wolowitz You’re reading Cosmo?
sheldon_cooper Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.
howard_wolowitz What’s this?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
sheldon_cooper It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.
raj_koothrappali It’s going to be okay.
sheldon_cooper I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.
howard_wolowitz So, you and Emily still together?
howard_wolowitz I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
howard_wolowitz Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?
raj_koothrappali She’s very real.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.
raj_koothrappali See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
howard_wolowitz I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.
raj_koothrappali You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
howard_wolowitz You got it.
raj_koothrappali No jokes about the year I took ballet.
howard_wolowitz You took ballet?
raj_koothrappali God, you never listen.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure you want to do this?
sheldon_cooper The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
leonard_hofstadter What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
sheldon_cooper You stop it.
penny So, how do you want me to cut it?
sheldon_cooper Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?
leonard_hofstadter So, business in the front, science in the back.
penny Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.
penny Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?
sheldon_cooper Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.
penny Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.
sheldon_cooper Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.
penny Okay, what do you think?
sheldon_cooper Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
leonard_hofstadter It actually looks good, Sheldon.
penny Doesn’t it?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry I’m late. What did you do?
penny I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.
sheldon_cooper She’s right. I’m too hot.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m excited to meet Emily.
howard_wolowitz Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why would you say that?
howard_wolowitz Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.
bernadette_rostenkowski How?
howard_wolowitz In a bad way, very bad.
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys.
howard_wolowitz Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.
raj_koothrappali Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.
emily_sweeney Nice to meet you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
emily_sweeney Have we met before?
howard_wolowitz Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.
emily_sweeney You sure? You look familiar.
howard_wolowitz Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.
emily_sweeney Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?
howard_wolowitz That must be it.
raj_koothrappali Since when do you go to spin class?
howard_wolowitz Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?
penny Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
sheldon_cooper Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
sheldon_cooper Have you considered studying standard model physics?
sheldon_cooper You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?
penny Like you could get a brown bear.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
sheldon_cooper Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.
leonard_hofstadter What about loop quantum gravity?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.
penny Who’s the duchess?
leonard_hofstadter One of the people that lives in his head.
amy_farrah_fowler I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
leonard_hofstadter Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.
penny Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
sheldon_cooper That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.
amy_farrah_fowler How does that happen?
sheldon_cooper A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
penny Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
sheldon_cooper Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?
penny And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
bernadette_rostenkowski Emily, what do you do?
emily_sweeney I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.
raj_koothrappali Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.
emily_sweeney This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.
raj_koothrappali Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.
emily_sweeney Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?
howard_wolowitz It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…
emily_sweeney Oh, my God, I remember.
howard_wolowitz Can I finish my astronaut story?
emily_sweeney It was four years ago.
howard_wolowitz Please don’t say it.
emily_sweeney We were set up on a blind date.
howard_wolowitz Please don’t say it.
emily_sweeney You came to my apartment.
howard_wolowitz You’re saying it.
raj_koothrappali Wh, what happened?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, what happened?
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.
bernadette_rostenkowski Please don’t say it.
howard_wolowitz One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.
emily_sweeney You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.
emily_sweeney Right, just water.
howard_wolowitz Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.
emily_sweeney It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.
raj_koothrappali Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
howard_wolowitz Yeah, yeah, I get it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
howard_wolowitz Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.
sheldon_cooper No more than Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s what I’m saying.
sheldon_cooper Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Empty room. Empty room. Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?
emily_sweeney I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re kidding, right?
raj_koothrappali She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.
howard_wolowitz Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, we moved on a long time ago.
howard_wolowitz I’m just saying…
bernadette_rostenkowski We moved on.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Fine.
bernadette_rostenkowski How’s your soup?
howard_wolowitz Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where are you going?
howard_wolowitz I need some fresh air.
emily_sweeney Been there.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no. What have I done?
leonard_hofstadter How you feeling?
sheldon_cooper Not so good.
leonard_hofstadter Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
sheldon_cooper It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?
leonard_hofstadter After she put you to bed, she went home.
sheldon_cooper Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.
answerphone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 First new message.
sheldon_cooper Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
howard_wolowitz You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?
sheldon_cooper Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
howard_wolowitz Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
sheldon_cooper I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
howard_wolowitz I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?
howard_wolowitz Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
sheldon_cooper Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.
barry_kripke Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.
howard_wolowitz Get out of here, Barry.
barry_kripke Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.
sheldon_cooper Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.
