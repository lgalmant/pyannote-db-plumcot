howard Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?
leonard Yes
howard Were you in the original trilogy?
leonard Yes
howard Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
leonard God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia.
raj Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?
leonard Yes
raj Interesting. Are you a Droid?
leonard Yes
raj Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
leonard Yes
raj C3PO.
leonard You got it.
sheldon That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it.
howard Leslie Winkle. You’ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.
sheldon What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?
leonard No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.
sheldon I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that.
leonard Alright, back to the game.
sheldon I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready.
raj Are you Spock?
sheldon I don’t like this game.
howard So, where were we?
raj Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
howard No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who’s turn is it?
leonard We were up to you.
howard Great, just start.
leonard Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?
howard She dumped me!
sheldon I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess.
raj What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?
howard I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.
sheldon I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having what appears be an emotional response?
leonard Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.
howard Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God’s sake!
leonard Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?
howard I don’t want to go anywhere.
sheldon You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems.Where you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.
raj Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!
leonard I’ve never been there, have you?
raj Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
howard It could be fun. I know my weekend’s wide open, now that…
leonard Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.
howard Now? Right now?
leonard Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now.
raj What do you say, Howard?
howard I say Vegas baby!
raj What are you going to tell your mother?
howard Sea World, baby!
leonard Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?
sheldon I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
leonard Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt.
sheldon Thank you. Hello, neighbour.
penny Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon And how are you doing this fine evening?
penny Great.
sheldon Good. I’m glad.
penny Really? Are you drunk?
sheldon I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.
penny That’s Superman’s big ice thing, right?
sheldon Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.
penny Mmm, what smells so good?
sheldon That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.
penny Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.
sheldon Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.
penny Have fun, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, I shall. No!
penny What’s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?
raj Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.
leonard Howard, could I borrow some after shave?
howard Black case, top compartment.
leonard That is a lot of cologne.
howard First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.
raj That’s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.
leonard Come on, let’s go.
howard You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.
leonard That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page.
howard Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.
raj But she did dump you.
howard Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you.
leonard Alright.
raj Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.
leonard Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on the moon.
raj Sounds like a plan.
penny Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.
sheldon We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
penny So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.
sheldon I left them in the bowl.
penny Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
sheldon Where?
penny In your apartment.
sheldon What’s it doing in my apartment?
penny Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and I forgot it there.
sheldon You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
penny It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.
sheldon You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
penny Alright, Sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting.
sheldon Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
penny Yeah, why not?
sheldon Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense.
leonard Thanks.
raj I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.
leonard Dude, check it out. That’s laundry for a month!
woman Hi.
raj Hello.
woman What’s your name?
raj Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
woman Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I’m Michaela.
raj Hello, Michaela.
michaela So, are you interested a little party?
raj Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren’t Ramayan.
leonard Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.
raj Not now, Leonard, Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.
leonard Yeah, I really need to talk to you.
raj Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are. What’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.
leonard Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute.
raj What? No. ..
leonard Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.
raj Maybe I can save her.
leonard Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.
raj It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.
michaela Whatever.
raj Oh, I miss her already.
leonard Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”
raj Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
leonard You think that’d help?
raj USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
leonard I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy.
raj It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.
leonard We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
raj “I’m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
leonard Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
sheldon So, how was your day?
penny Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to.
sheldon No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?
penny Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
sheldon I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat.
raj Hello again.
michaela Oh, hi.
leonard Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…
raj If you’re really a prostitute.
michaela You guys cops?
together No.
michaela I am a prostitute.
leonard Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.
raj With sex.
leonard I think she knows what I meant.
raj How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
michaela Don’t worry, I can take good care of your friend.
leonard Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…
raj Prostitute.
michaela You want the girlfriend experience.
leonard Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.
raj Uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.
sheldon Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess.
penny Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
sheldon How can one person be a whole movie?
penny Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?
sheldon Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
penny What?
sheldon Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
penny Where did that even come from, did he say we were?
sheldon No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.
penny No, just mail, no benefits.
sheldon Hmm, I see.
penny Why are you asking?
sheldon I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.
penny Well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship.
sheldon Can you?
penny Excuse me?
sheldon Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
penny Sheldon, I really don’t want to talk about this with you.
sheldon Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
penny Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?
sheldon I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…
penny I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!
sheldon Thank you, that’s very helpful.
howard Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?
leonard Behold?
howard Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?
raj A little baby.
howard I’m going back to the room.
michaela Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?
howard Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.
michaela Esther Rosenblatt.
penny I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here.
sheldon Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
penny Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one I’m going with.
sheldon I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.
penny What?
sheldon There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head.
penny Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
sheldon May I say one last thing.
penny Only if it doesn’t rhyme.
sheldon Alright. Goodnight.
michaela Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.
howard Really, me too.
michaela Oy gevalt, you’re hot.
howard Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
leonard Hey, how’s it going.
howard Cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?
leonard Yes.
howard She’s a hooker, isn’t she.
raj A prostitute, yes.
howard You already gave her the money?
leonard Yes.
howard Thank you!
sheldon Penny.
penny What?
sheldon I can’t sleep. how are you going?
penny Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
sheldon I’m homesick.
penny Your home is twenty feet from here.
sheldon Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. It’s in a galaxy far, far away.
penny Damn it. What do you want me to do
sheldon Sing soft kitty.
penny That’s only for when you’re sick.
sheldon Homesick is a type of being sick.
penny Come on, do I really have to?
sheldon I suppose we can stay up and talk.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…
sheldon Sleepy kitty.
penny Sleepy ki…
sheldon No. Start over.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
sheldon Penny.
penny Yeah.
sheldon Thank you for letting me stay here.
penny Oh, you’re welcome sweetie.
sheldon Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out.
sheldon Oh, good, you’re finally home.
leonard What were you doing at Penny’s?
sheldon Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.
