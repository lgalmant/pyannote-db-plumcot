howard_wolowitz T-minus 60 seconds.
raj_koothrappali Oh, it all comes down to this.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’ve got butterflies.
sheldon_cooper Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.
penny What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.
penny Oh.
howard_wolowitz T Minus 45 seconds.
leonard_hofstadter They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…
sheldon_cooper Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.
penny This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
howard_wolowitz T-minus 30 seconds.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.
sheldon_cooper Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.
raj_koothrappali And I told you I get diaper rash.
howard_wolowitz 15 seconds.
leonard_hofstadter Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.
howard_wolowitz Five, four, three, two, one.
sheldon_cooper It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.
raj_koothrappali Anyone in?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Not yet.
howard_wolowitz Nope.
sheldon_cooper Do not stop refreshing your screens.
all@ Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….
penny Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.
all@ Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…
howard_wolowitz It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.
penny To be cool? Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue.
sheldon_cooper Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
raj_koothrappali Uh, what number in line are you?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, fifteen…
howard_wolowitz Great.
leonard_hofstadter …thousand two hundred and eleven.
howard_wolowitz Damn.
raj_koothrappali Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.
howard_wolowitz Really?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.
leonard_hofstadter Sunday’s gone.
sheldon_cooper Not Sunday, I love Sunday.
raj_koothrappali So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz I can’t believe we’re not going.
sheldon_cooper It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me.
penny Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
penny What? You were all going as the Hulk?
howard_wolowitz Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.
raj_koothrappali We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
all@ Yeah.
penny And we’re back to the first kind of sad.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
sheldon_cooper I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
leonard_hofstadter Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.
howard_wolowitz I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
sheldon_cooper How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
leonard_hofstadter The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention.
sheldon_cooper You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.
leonard_hofstadter Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t even get to that part.
leonard_hofstadter Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.
sheldon_cooper Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.
sheldon_cooper You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
leonard_hofstadter Good luck.
sheldon_cooper No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.
penny I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.
amy_farrah_fowler Last week, you spent that on a little dress.
penny Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.
bernadette_rostenkowski Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.
amy_farrah_fowler Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. You mean like a museum?
penny Yes, like a museum, but anything else.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.
penny Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.
bernadette_rostenkowski La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.
penny No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.
raj_koothrappali Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.
howard_wolowitz Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.
leonard_hofstadter Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
sheldon_cooper I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.
raj_koothrappali How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
sheldon_cooper Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…
howard_wolowitz And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.
sheldon_cooper You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…
howard_wolowitz Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late.
raj_koothrappali Does he sound like a criminal?
howard_wolowitz What do you mean?
raj_koothrappali You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.
raj_koothrappali I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?
howard_wolowitz Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
leonard_hofstadter Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.
howard_wolowitz Why do you think I told him to come to your place?
amy_farrah_fowler There sure are a lot of little kids here.
penny I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s cute.
amy_farrah_fowler It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
bernadette_rostenkowski Should we leave?
penny Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.
bernadette_rostenkowski I could go for a drink.
amy_farrah_fowler Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.
james_earl_jones Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?
sheldon_cooper Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker.
james_earl_jones Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.
sheldon_cooper He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe this isn’t a good idea.
howard_wolowitz I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
raj_koothrappali Do it.
howard_wolowitz Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.
leonard_hofstadter Hold on. We always do this.
howard_wolowitz Do what?
leonard_hofstadter Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.
raj_koothrappali That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
leonard_hofstadter Even Batman breaks the rules.
raj_koothrappali You know I struggle with Batman.
leonard_hofstadter I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, you in on this?
howard_wolowitz No need. I’m breaking rules all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Name one.
howard_wolowitz Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
raj_koothrappali What about that little cup they give you?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. What about it?
raj_koothrappali Are you impressed by that?
leonard_hofstadter A little.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, me, too.
james_earl_jones You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.
sheldon_cooper Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?
james_earl_jones He was not. How messed up was that?
sheldon_cooper So messed up.
james_earl_jones What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.
penny So, afternoon tea was a bust.
amy_farrah_fowler On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.
penny Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.
bernadette_rostenkowski Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.
penny Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.
amy_farrah_fowler Gosh.
penny I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.
amy_farrah_fowler I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.
penny Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.
penny Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
howard_wolowitz He just parked. He’s on his way up.
leonard_hofstadter Good. This is exciting.
raj_koothrappali It is. I feel alive.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.
raj_koothrappali Maybe slapped with a fine.
howard_wolowitz Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?
raj_koothrappali Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?
leonard_hofstadter I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
raj_koothrappali He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?
howard_wolowitz Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away.
raj_koothrappali I thought you were a badass.
howard_wolowitz I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.
sheldon_cooper Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?
james_earl_jones It is true.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
james_earl_jones They sure did.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
james_earl_jones That’s right.
sheldon_cooper Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.
penny I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.
penny I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.
amy_farrah_fowler I told you it was Penny.
penny Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are.
howard_wolowitz Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.
sheldon_cooper Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.
james_earl_jones I am.
sheldon_cooper In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…
james_earl_jones Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…
sheldon_cooper Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.
james_earl_jones Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…
scene Outside a house.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand what we’re doing.
james_earl_jones Shh.
sheldon_cooper Whose house is this?
james_earl_jones Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run.
carrie_fisher It’s not funny anymore, James.
james_earl_jones Then why am I laughing?
james_earl_jones Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.
sheldon_cooper Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
james_earl_jones What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?
sheldon_cooper Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
james_earl_jones No. Something about a convention.
sheldon_cooper Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.
james_earl_jones Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?
sheldon_cooper Really?
james_earl_jones Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night.
sheldon_cooper Ay-yi-yi.
james_earl_jones Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.
james_earl_jones So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?
