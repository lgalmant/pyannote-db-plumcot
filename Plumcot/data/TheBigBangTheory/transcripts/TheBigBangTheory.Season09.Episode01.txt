penny So, what package are you thinking?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.
penny Why would we want that?
leonard_hofstadter ‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope.
penny Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
leonard_hofstadter If you’re not into this, we can do it another time.
penny No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.
leonard_hofstadter Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, have you gotten married yet?
leonard_hofstadter No. Why?
sheldon_cooper Good. Don’t do it.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
sheldon_cooper Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
leonard_hofstadter What happened now?
sheldon_cooper Amy has ended our relationship.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. Seriously?
penny What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter Amy broke up with Sheldon.
penny She did?
sheldon_cooper Is Penny crying?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
sheldon_cooper Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad.
sheldon_cooper Whatever.
penny Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Not really. Can you come over?
penny Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.
amy_farrah_fowler Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
penny Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
amy_farrah_fowler Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.
penny Amy, don’t be like that.
sheldon_cooper Why did I just hear Amy’s name?
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s on the phone with her.
sheldon_cooper Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care.
penny Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
sheldon_cooper Amy’s upset? Is it about me?
leonard_hofstadter No, I think it’s because we’re eloping.
sheldon_cooper Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper When last we spoke, you said you needed time.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it’s only been 11 hours.
sheldon_cooper The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know.
sheldon_cooper Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
sheldon_cooper Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re not back together.
sheldon_cooper Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?
amy_farrah_fowler If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding.
sheldon_cooper And who’s this guy you’re taking?
amy_farrah_fowler There’s no guy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends.
sheldon_cooper Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
sheldon_cooper We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.
leonard_hofstadter They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.
penny Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it.
penny Me, too.
leonard_hofstadter You sure?
penny Yes.
leonard_hofstadter And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
penny Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?
leonard_hofstadter You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
penny What if they call our names?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.
penny Oh, and the fairy tale continues.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you for doing this.
bernadette_rostenkowski Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
amy_farrah_fowler We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling.
howard_wolowitz Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
howard_wolowitz I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
stuart_bloom I know what you’re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. What was her name?
stuart_bloom Hey, it’s a true story. I don’t need the third degree.
bernadette_rostenkowski For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, do something.
howard_wolowitz I’m on it.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.
sheldon_cooper I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
amy_farrah_fowler They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.
raj_koothrappali Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
official#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 So, when you hear the music, that’s your cue. Any questions?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.
official#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 Where are the rose petals?!
leonard_hofstadter You know what? It’s fine.
female_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!
penny Really, we’re good.
leonard_hofstadter Yup, just want to get married.
penny Yeah.
official#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 Great. I’ll see you two up there.
leonard_hofstadter This is it.
penny I know.
leonard_hofstadter I love you.
penny I love you, too.
female_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?
penny No, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter We’re good.
sheldon_cooper Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.
raj_koothrappali Didn’t even crack the top ten.
sheldon_cooper Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.
amy_farrah_fowler I said I needed time to think.
raj_koothrappali I’m sure you guys will figure something out.
sheldon_cooper You hear that? Raj is devastated.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting.
sheldon_cooper I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard.
howard_wolowitz I’m not taking sides.
sheldon_cooper Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj.
raj_koothrappali Really?
stuart_bloom At least you got picked.
official#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
penny No. You wrote vows?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.
leonard_hofstadter It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.
penny No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.
penny Wow.
official#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 Penny?
penny Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.
official#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 Is that the song from Toy Story?
penny He loves that movie.
leonard_hofstadter I do.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that was beautiful.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, we totally won.
sheldon_cooper Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
sheldon_cooper Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.
amy_farrah_fowler You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy.
sheldon_cooper Will someone take me home?
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride.
penny We did it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch.
howard_wolowitz We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.
penny Can you?
leonard_hofstadter Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
penny Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?
leonard_hofstadter I’m okay.
penny Nicely done.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.
penny Well, the night is still young.
leonard_hofstadter Everything all right?
penny Yeah. I guess.
leonard_hofstadter Just tell me.
penny It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.
penny You’re right. Just forget it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.
penny Did you feel guilty?
leonard_hofstadter No, she had dental insurance.
penny Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
penny What do you mean, every time you see her?
leonard_hofstadter What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.
penny You still see her?
leonard_hofstadter Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.
penny You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
leonard_hofstadter I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking
penny Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?
leonard_hofstadter No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Mother.
mary_cooper Shelly! How’s my baby doing?
sheldon_cooper I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
mary_cooper Oh, what’s going on?
sheldon_cooper She broke up with me.
mary_cooper Oh, Shelly.
sheldon_cooper No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.
mary_cooper Well, let’s not be hasty. Are you sure it’s over for good?
sheldon_cooper It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
mary_cooper You want to tell me what happened?
sheldon_cooper Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?
mary_cooper Good chance.
sheldon_cooper Then no, thank you.
mary_cooper Well, honey, don’t send it back yet. Your sister’s married, and I’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating.
sheldon_cooper Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
mary_cooper When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Everything’s gonna be okay.
stuart_bloom You’ve got so much to offer.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
stuart_bloom Any man would be lucky to have you.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s true.
amy_farrah_fowler I just hope I did the right thing.
stuart_bloom I’m sure you did. Maybe that’s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing.
amy_farrah_fowler Like you’re doing right now?
stuart_bloom Exactly.
leonard_hofstadter I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
penny I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
sheldon_cooper Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not glowing. I’m upset.
sheldon_cooper Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.
sheldon_cooper Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
penny What’s this?
sheldon_cooper Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.
penny Oh. That’s so sweet of you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.
penny I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.
penny You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
sheldon_cooper He does? Who is it?
penny Some girl named Mandy.
sheldon_cooper Mandy Chao?
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better
penny That’s great.
sheldon_cooper Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.
penny That’s ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.
penny I’m with Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?
penny Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.
sheldon_cooper Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
penny I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
sheldon_cooper Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
penny Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
sheldon_cooper I see. Well, I think I’ll be going.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.
howard_wolowitz All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.
bernadette_rostenkowski What happened? They just got married.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.
bernadette_rostenkowski Think they’ll break up?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.
stuart_bloom Really?
sheldon_cooper Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, let’s make it an even hundred.
sheldon_cooper You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t.
sheldon_cooper And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.
leonard_hofstadter I figured that out.
sheldon_cooper You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
leonard_hofstadter Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.
sheldon_cooper Really? I never imagined it any other way.
