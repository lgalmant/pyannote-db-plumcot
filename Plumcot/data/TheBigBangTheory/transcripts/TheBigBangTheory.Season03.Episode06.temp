leonard Kites, ho!
howard Kites ho!
raj Kites ho!
all_three Kites, ho!
sheldon Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!
the_three_guys Kites, ho!
penny Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?
leonard If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.
leonard We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
penny Kite fighting?
leonard Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
sheldon Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.
leonard You want to come watch?
penny Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
leonard Oh. Football, sure.
howard Good guess.
penny I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan.
leonard No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.
penny Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone.
leonard Yeah, great.
penny See ya.
leonard Well, this sucks.
sheldon I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
raj Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites.
sheldon Oh, that certainly would suck.
sheldon Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.
leonard Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
sheldon Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.
leonard Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her.
sheldon You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.
leonard Sorry.
sheldon Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
raj Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…
howard Whoa! Did you see that?
raj See what?
howard That chick, she smiled at me.
raj No, she didn’t.
howard Yes, she did.
raj Come on, scissors, scissors!
howard Hold my line.
raj Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
sheldon Victory!
raj Son of a bitch.
raj You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.
howard What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
raj If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
howard I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.
raj Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.
leonard So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?
sheldon Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.
leonard Oh, how kind of her.
sheldon Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
raj You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with.
howard I totally had a shot.
raj With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?
sheldon I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. I have your kite. I have your kite.
leonard Hey.
penny Hi.
leonard How was your football party?
penny It was pretty good. We won.
leonard Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t
penny I’m glad to hear it.
leonard Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
penny Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?
leonard Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.
penny Sure you have.
leonard Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?
penny Of course not.
leonard Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
penny Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored.
leonard I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
penny Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists.
leonard Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.
penny Like who?
leonard Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.
penny Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
leonard Another football game?
penny They have them every week.
leonard Did not know that.
penny You wanted to meet my friends.
leonard Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.
penny Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
leonard Great.
leonard Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.
raj Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.
leonard Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.
raj I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
howard Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.
raj I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?
howard Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
raj It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them.
howard But I had a shot with that jogger.
raj Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
howard It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
leonard There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
howard All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.
leonard Sacks, sacks…
sheldon It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
leonard Huh… Scrimmage…
sheldon The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
leonard Oh.
howard Sheldon knows football?
leonard Apparently.
howard I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?
leonard Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
sheldon I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
leonard Unbelievable.
sheldon If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.
leonard So you could teach me?
sheldon Football or chicken-fried meats?
leonard Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
sheldon If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
leonard Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.
sheldon That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.
leonard Please, I’m asking you as a friend.
sheldon Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Fine.
leonard I really appreciate this.
sheldon Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
leonard I’m sorry?
sheldon That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.
leonard When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
sheldon When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
leonard What’s wrong with a football jersey?
sheldon Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
leonard I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.
sheldon Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
leonard Anyway, wish me luck.
sheldon Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
leonard Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.
sheldon How would you put it?
leonard Yeah, okay, like you said.
sheldon Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.
leonard Good-Bye, Sheldon.
sheldon Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
leonard Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
sheldon What’s funny about Cylon toast?
raj It’s open.
howard Hey, pal.
raj What do you want?
howard I brought you a little gift. New kite.
raj The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.
howard Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?
raj Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.
howard Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be.
raj You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.
howard Stipulated.
raj And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.
howard I know, I know.
raj And where were you?
howard Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.
raj You’re impossible.
howard Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.
raj Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.
howard No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself.
raj No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.
howard Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want.
raj I don’t know.
howard Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
raj I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
howard Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.
raj Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?
leonard Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
penny Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.
leonard Oh. Did not know that.
penny How much beer have you had?
leonard None, why?
penny Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.
leonard Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.
guy_in_baseball_hat Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding.
second_guy Totally.
leonard That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
penny Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
leonard Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant.
penny I know. I just need you stop talking.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Sheldon, come in.
sheldon Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.
penny There’s some in the fridge.
sheldon You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
penny On Earth, we say thank you.
sheldon So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
leonard Mimesis?
sheldon You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
leonard What the hell are you talking about?
sheldon I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
leonard Oh, I guess so.
sheldon Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
leonard I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.
sheldon I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
leonard Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
penny You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
leonard No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.
penny Until half time.
leonard This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
penny And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
leonard Oh, you’re kidding me.
penny No.
leonard Nice meeting all of you.
penny So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart.
raj I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
howard My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie.
raj I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
howard Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?
raj Fine. Go ahead.
howard No. This is our day.
raj If you want to chase after her, chase after her.
howard Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that.
raj Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
howard You think so?
raj Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.
howard Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.
raj Actually, in this case, I think she was.
howard Really?
raj Yeah.
howard Bye.
raj What a douche.
