sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.
leonard_hofstadter Five.
sheldon_cooper Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
howard_wolowitz E.
sheldon_cooper And a funny Greek letter.
raj_koothrappali Gamma.
sheldon_cooper I said funny.
raj_koothrappali Upsilon?
sheldon_cooper Good one. And an electrical charge.
leonard_hofstadter Positive.
sheldon_cooper Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a . Okay. No, no. I’ll start over. Professor
howard_wolowitz I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not funny. That mistake got published.
sheldon_cooper Stop! I’m going to wet myself!
raj_koothrappali Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.
howard_wolowitz I wonder what he wants.
leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.
president_siebert Dr. Cooper?
leonard_hofstadter Told ya.
sheldon_cooper Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.
president_siebert No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.
sheldon_cooper You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.
president_siebert Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation.
sheldon_cooper I don’t need a vacation.
president_siebert You’re obligated to take one. And I’d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I’ll see you all on Monday, except for you.
sheldon_cooper But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?
president_siebert Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
howard_wolowitz No. You should go.
leonard_hofstadter That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…
sheldon_cooper Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Bleeding from my ears.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing hiding back there?
sheldon_cooper I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps.
leonard_hofstadter Lobster traps?
sheldon_cooper Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
leonard_hofstadter What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
sheldon_cooper Will they, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there.
sheldon_cooper And no more singing.
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
sheldon_cooper I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
penny I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
bernadette_rostenkowski Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.
amy_farrah_fowler This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.
bernadette_rostenkowski You mean my special day?
amy_farrah_fowler They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
bernadette_rostenkowski If I ever actually ever get married.
penny Why wouldn’t you?
bernadette_rostenkowski My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.
penny Ouch.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.
amy_farrah_fowler Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.
penny You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with sex.
penny Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. You would fetch a unicorn.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
sheldon_cooper Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.
howard_wolowitz How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.
sheldon_cooper My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
raj_koothrappali You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones.
howard_wolowitz I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
raj_koothrappali Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
sheldon_cooper It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.
howard_wolowitz I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.
sheldon_cooper One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.
howard_wolowitz Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
sheldon_cooper Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab.
howard_wolowitz Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?
sheldon_cooper Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey, you.
leonard_hofstadter Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.
penny Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?
leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway.
penny What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. That’s rough.
penny So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?
penny I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.
leonard_hofstadter Joke all you want, but you think about it.
penny Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.
leonard_hofstadter Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
sheldon_cooper Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic.
sheldon_cooper Way to kill the mood.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell.
sheldon_cooper Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.
sheldon_cooper Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?
amy_farrah_fowler No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.
sheldon_cooper What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.
sheldon_cooper I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.
leonard_hofstadter Where’s Howard?
raj_koothrappali No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
raj_koothrappali Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
leonard_hofstadter Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated.
leonard_hofstadter I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
raj_koothrappali Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
howard_wolowitz Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.
howard_wolowitz I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.
howard_wolowitz A pre-nup? Wow.
leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna do?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
raj_koothrappali Follow your heart.
howard_wolowitz You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.
raj_koothrappali Like what?
howard_wolowitz I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.
raj_koothrappali Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
sheldon_cooper Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
amy_farrah_fowler Soap spots. Wash ’em again.
sheldon_cooper Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.
sheldon_cooper Biologists are mean.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.
sheldon_cooper There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sure it was.
sheldon_cooper I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.
sheldon_cooper You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
sheldon_cooper 366… 367…
amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going?
sheldon_cooper How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.
amy_farrah_fowler Great.
sheldon_cooper Aw, nuts! One…
sheldon_cooper This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? Is that what you think?
sheldon_cooper Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right.
sheldon_cooper Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
sheldon_cooper You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.
sheldon_cooper All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you.
sheldon_cooper It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
sheldon_cooper No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
amy_farrah_fowler No. But your thumb does.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, you’re a biologist.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
howard_wolowitz What happened to your thumb?
sheldon_cooper You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on.
barman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 What can I get you?
sheldon_cooper Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those.
penny Hey, what are you guys doing here?
howard_wolowitz We’re grown men, we drink at bars.
penny No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, sure.
penny You and Amy? Good?
sheldon_cooper Oh, better than good.
penny You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
howard_wolowitz I’m not signing a pre-nup.
penny All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound.
sheldon_cooper Amy? Amy? Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler What do you want?
sheldon_cooper I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
sheldon_cooper I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s not an apology.
sheldon_cooper That is your opinion.
amy_farrah_fowler I want a real apology.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper That my genius…
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper That the soap was…
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday.
sheldon_cooper Next year I’m going to Epcot.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you mad at me?
howard_wolowitz No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, what are we gonna do?
howard_wolowitz You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Oh, that’d be so great.
howard_wolowitz Done.
bernadette_rostenkowski I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish.
howard_wolowitz Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?
bernadette_rostenkowski So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.
howard_wolowitz You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May.
bernadette_rostenkowski In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.
howard_wolowitz They’ve got a phone.
