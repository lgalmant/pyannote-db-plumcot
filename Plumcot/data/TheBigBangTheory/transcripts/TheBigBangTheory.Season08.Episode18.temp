sheldon Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.
amy I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t.
sheldon Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
amy Oh, let me see.
sheldon I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
amy Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.
sheldon Well, that can’t be right.
amy It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
sheldon All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
amy Poor Leonard.
sheldon Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
amy He might not be.
sheldon Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.
amy Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?
sheldon Oh, I’d be incensed.
amy So you see what I’m getting at?
sheldon Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
amy No.
sheldon Grass is always greener?
amy Try again.
sheldon Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me.
amy Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad.
sheldon But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.
amy Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
sheldon Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.
amy Exactly.
sheldon For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.
howard Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
raj Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.
bernadette Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.
howard Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories.
bernadette Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
howard Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.
sheldon Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.
leonard Actually, your name is on the electric bill.
sheldon Oh, right. This is a disaster.
leonard I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.
sheldon Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it.
leonard What’s going on?
sheldon An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
leonard Did they hate it?
sheldon No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.
leonard So what’s the problem?
sheldon You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.
leonard Really?
sheldon I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.
leonard Uh, that, that’s not necessary.
sheldon It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.
leonard Cooper and his team?
sheldon You should know I had nothing to do with that.
leonard Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.
sheldon You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
leonard That’s not helping.
sheldon Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable.
howard Stuart, we’re here.
raj It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
howard Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.
stuart Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out.
bernadette What happened?
stuart I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.
howard Wait, when did it go out?
stuart In the middle of the night.
howard Oh, my God.
bernadette Howie, what’s wrong?
howard It’s all defrosting.
bernadette It’s okay. It’s just food.
howard It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one.
raj Everything okay?
howard No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
bernadette Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?
raj You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
bernadette What should we do?
howard I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.
bernadette There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.
howard All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
bernadette Howie.
howard Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.
bernadette I love that.
raj Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
penny I mean, who even reads Scientific American?
leonard It’s kind of a big deal.
penny If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?
leonard Can we please just stop talking about it?
penny I’m sorry. What can I do?
leonard Nothing, I’m fine.
penny No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
leonard What are we doing?
penny I am taking you shopping.
leonard Oh.
penny My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again.
leonard Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing.
penny Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
leonard Does it have a camera in it?
penny It does have a camera in it.
leonard Baby’s listening.
sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard What?
sheldon I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
leonard What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
sheldon I did.
leonard Thank you. What did he say?
sheldon He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
leonard Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.
penny You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.
sheldon Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.
penny You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?
leonard If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.
sheldon Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
leonard No.
sheldon Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.
sheldon All he had was an idea.
amy Well, that is an important part.
sheldon Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
amy But Leonard’s idea was good.
sheldon Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.
leonard I’m the one who thought of it.
penny Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?
leonard Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
penny And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.
sheldon Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
amy It’s not your fault.
sheldon Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
amy Not your fault.
sheldon Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?
amy Hey, look at that pretty bird.
leonard He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.
penny I know, I know.
leonard I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.
raj Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.
bernadette Thanks.
howard Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.
bernadette Did she throw anything away?
howard No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.
raj Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.
howard No, that’s noodle kugel.
raj One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
howard Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
bernadette You okay?
howard Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.
raj You got it.
howard I’m never gonna talk to her again.
bernadette Should we tell everyone not to come?
howard No. I want to do this.
bernadette Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.
howard Okay.
raj I’m not making any promises.
stuart Glad you guys could make it.
leonard Of course.
penny Wow, it looks really pretty in here.
stuart Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.
leonard So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?
stuart And there goes the mood.
sheldon Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.
leonard Subtle.
sheldon But you got it, right?
howard Hey, guys.
all Hey. Hi. Hello.
howard I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.
bernadette Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.
howard Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
amy Do you need any help in the kitchen?
bernadette No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.
penny All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?
amy Yes, so please behave yourselves.
leonard Fine.
sheldon Of course.
stuart So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?
penny This food is amazing.
raj Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.
howard That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.
amy All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
sheldon Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.
penny Oh, so it’s like The View.
amy Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.
penny Shut up.
raj I would like to propose a salon topic.
amy Ooh, please do, Rajesh.
raj The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
penny Wait, who’s Tor?
raj You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
howard Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
stuart It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.
amy We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
howard I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
penny Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
sheldon I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.
leonard Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?
bernadette Oh, that’s fine.
sheldon Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.
amy Sheldon.
penny Guys.
leonard No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
howard Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.
sheldon Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.
leonard Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
sheldon Leonard, please. His mother just died.
leonard You’re being ridiculous.
sheldon Yeah, so are you.
penny Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon.
sheldon Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.
leonard Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
sheldon Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.
amy And girls.
sheldon Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.
leonard So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
sheldon I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
leonard You want some of this? I’ll give you some.
bernadette Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
sheldon She said my name first, that must kill you.
bernadette I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…
howard You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
amy I don’t hear it.
raj No, not at all.
penny I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
howard It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
sheldon You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…
penny Shut up.
ra So glad you two are done fighting.
leonard Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.
sheldon Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
stuart What’d they say?
amy Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
sheldon They did.
all Yay.
bernadette Good news, I found more Tums.
all Yay.
