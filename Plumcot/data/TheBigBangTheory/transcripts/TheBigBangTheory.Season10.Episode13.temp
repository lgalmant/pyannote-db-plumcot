penny What, what’s all this?
leonard Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.
penny Oh, that is so thoughtful.
leonard Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?
penny Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it.
leonard and this wine is why.
penny Oh. Hey, what smells so good?
leonard I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
penny Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
leonard Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself.
penny Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this.
leonard Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.
penny You did not just quote an Nsync song.
leonard I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
penny Oh.
leonard Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.
sheldon Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?
leonard Why?
sheldon I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
leonard That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
sheldon That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?
leonard Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
sheldon Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
leonard If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me.
sheldon Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.
leonard So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.
sheldon At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?
leonard Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
amy Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?
penny I hadn’t really thought about it.
amy But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.
bernadette Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
amy Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him.
bernadette I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real.
penny Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?
bernadette Uh oh, what’s going on?
penny Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.
bernadette It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now.
amy Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
penny Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more.
amy Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out.
howard All right, got Halley to sleep.
raj Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.
howard Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room.
raj Have you tried anything to fix it?
howard Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help.
raj I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?
howard Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
raj Did that do anything?
howard Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug.
sheldon If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move.
leonard Oh, no. Good game.
penny Hey.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?
penny Oh, it was fine.
sheldon Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
penny Uh, chips.
sheldon Anything to drink?
penny Some wine.
sheldon Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.
leonard Just ignore him.
penny Hm. At least he took an interest.
leonard What’s that supposed to mean?
penny Nothing.
leonard Hey, what’s going on with you?
penny I don’t want to talk about it.
leonard Well, hey, come on, just tell me.
penny Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
leonard What? Where is this coming from?
sheldon Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.
penny It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more.
leonard That is ridiculous.
penny This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.
leonard No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
penny Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.
leonard Fine, go ahead.
sheldon Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.
bernadette Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.
howard That sounds expensive.
raj Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.
howard MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.
raj Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?
howard No.
raj Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?
howard No.
bernadette I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
howard Is that supposed to be funny?
raj Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny.
penny All right, we’re heading out.
leonard Mm-hmm.
amy I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
sheldon And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
amy I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.
leonard Have fun.
penny Thanks. Are you ready?
amy Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.
sheldon You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
leonard Go ahead, it’s fine.
sheldon Bye.
amy Bye.
leonard Okay.
penny Let’s go.
amy Bye.
sheldon Bye.
amy I’ll miss you.
sheldon Yeah, I’ll miss you too.
amy I’ll miss you more.
sheldon Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one.
amy If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…
leonard Thank you.
sheldon Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea.
leonard Thanks.
sheldon And it’s just the way you like it.
leonard Earl grey?
sheldon Yes.
leonard Honey?
sheldon Yes.
leonard Unsweetened almond…
sheldon Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.
leonard Sorry, thank you.
sheldon Well, what can we do to cheer you up?
leonard I really don’t know.
sheldon You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?
leonard I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.
sheldon Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.
leonard Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.
sheldon Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh.
howard Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.
raj It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
howard Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
raj Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.
howard Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it.
raj It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
howard Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
raj Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
howard It’s a tradition of my people. If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.
raj Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.
sheldon Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
leonard Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
sheldon Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?
leonard I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
sheldon Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.
leonard I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got.
penny When was the last time you got a massage?
amy Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.
penny Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.
amy I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?
penny Well, yeah.
amy Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
leonard Hey.
penny What are you doing here?
leonard I came here to apologize.
penny Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.
leonard Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.
sheldon Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you.
amy Nice to see you, too.
sheldon And that’s how you make effort look effortless.
penny All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
leonard I don’t understand what you want.
penny I’m trying to figure it out.
sheldon You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.
amy Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?
sheldon Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.
howard So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,
raj Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.
howard Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.
bernadette You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
raj Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed.
howard Bigger problems, I felt something pop.
sheldon There’s a cucumber in my water.
amy Uh-huh.
sheldon Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?
amy It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.
sheldon Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh.
leonard Hey.
penny Hey.
sheldon Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?
penny We’re not getting divorced.
leonard Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.
penny Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um.
leonard Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule.
penny Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
leonard What do you say?
sheldon I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started.
penny Do you really think that’s funny?
amy It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.
sheldon If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.
penny Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.
leonard Does it really need to say that?
sheldon I did this for free, let me get a little something.
leonard Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it.
penny I think this all looks good.
leonard Me, too.
sheldon Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.
amy I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
sheldon Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
amy Right, right. Got it.
