sheldon Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?
policeman Here. Breathe into this bag.
leonard What’s going on?
sheldon They stole everything, Leonard, everything.
policeman Are you the roommate?
leonard Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?
policeman Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.
leonard Oh, my God, what did they get?
sheldon What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.
leonard You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
sheldon What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.
policeman Into the bag.
sheldon They took my battle ostrich.
leonard Oh, no, not Glenn?
sheldon Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.
policeman Good luck, fellas.
leonard Thank you, officer.
sheldon Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?
policeman Mr. Cooper, there’s nothing…
sheldon Doctor Cooper.
policeman Seriously?
leonard Not the kind with access to drugs.
policeman Fine. Dr. Cooper. I’m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn’t have jurisdiction in Pandora.
sheldon That’s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?
policeman What?
sheldon You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?
policeman No.
leonard Thank you, officer.
sheldon It’s all gone. All gone.
leonard I’m really sorry, Sheldon.
sheldon What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?
leonard I don’t know.
sheldon This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.
leonard I’m on it. Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.
sheldon See if Raj is done with Pilates.
sheldon Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.
howard Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint.
sheldon Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
raj Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things.
sheldon Can we trust him?
raj I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.
howard Whoa! Somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
sheldon No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope.
penny Hey.
leonard Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.
penny Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.
sheldon That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game.
raj Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.
penny Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!
sheldon Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
penny Just say thank you.
sheldon I thought I just did.
penny All right. See you later.
priya Oh! Hello.
penny Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place.
priya I don’t know what that means.
penny Yeah, well, sadly, I do.
penny Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
bernadette I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information.
penny I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.
bernadette I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
penny So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
amy I think you’re on.
bernadette Oh. That bitch!
penny Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
amy Ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.
penny You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.
amy I’m drunk.
penny You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.
bernadette Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again.
penny No, don’t do that. No reason to be mean to her.
amy This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?
penny No, but I can name all the Kardashians.
amy Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.
bernadette I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
amy Believe me, it’s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I’ll show you.
howard All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.
raj I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
howard Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
leonard Okay, what exactly are we looking for?
howard Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy.
priya Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.
leonard Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.
priya Seriously?
leonard Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun.
priya Maybe I should just go home.
howard Our troll just walked in! I got him!
leonard We got him. We’re almost done.
howard So, how do you guys want to play this?
sheldon Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.
raj Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.
sheldon I don’t care! I’m losin’ it, man!
leonard Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.
priya Oh, dear Lord.
howard Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.
raj Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I’ll have sex with him.
leonard That’s not where it was going.
raj Good, because I would hate that.
priya Leonard, you’re busy, let’s talk tomorrow.
leonard Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?
priya No, no, I think it’s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man’s body.
leonard Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens.
sheldon And people think I don’t get sarcasm.
amy Well, well, well. Look who it is.
penny Okay, be nice.
priya Hello.
penny Hi. We’re just heading out for a drink.
amy Because I do that now.
bernadette Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.
priya What?
penny Don’t listen to her, she’s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?
priya Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.
amy Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?
leonard Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
raj Oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between.
leonard Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?
raj There’s no reason to worry.
leonard That’s a relief.
raj I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
howard Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.
sheldon What?
leonard Really?
howard Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.
sheldon I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!
howard Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.
sheldon The name and the address drip with evil.
raj What else do we know about him?
howard Well, quite a bit, actually.
leonard I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
howard Yes, he does live with his parents. Here’s a Google Earth shot of their house.
sheldon Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
leonard Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?
sheldon Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
leonard Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?
sheldon I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.
leonard No one’s getting tortured.
sheldon Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?
raj I totally had one of those.
sheldon Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?
raj I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?
sheldon Sure.
howard Also, tonight’s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and
sheldon Fine. Leonard?
leonard Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
raj Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.
leonard Aw, screw it. I’m in.
raj Me, too.
howard And me.
sheldon One moment. I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.
sheldon I’m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.
howard I am. She’s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N’s, one V.
howards_mother Fanny pack of wolves.
leonard That’s incredible.
howard Yeah, she’s kind of a Wheel savant.
leonard Uh-oh, that’s Priya.
raj Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.
leonard Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.
raj Very nice. You lie to my sister.
howard That’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.
raj Oh, guess who.
leonard Cover for me.
raj Hello, Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.
howard New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D’s, three O’s.
howards_mother Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
sheldon That’s uncanny.
howard I know. It’s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.
leonard I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
howard Yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?
leonard Totally.
raj Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?
sheldon Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.
raj Yeah, we’re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.
sheldon I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?
raj I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
sheldon This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
raj It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
howard Beyonce? Really?
raj She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.
leonard Oh, yeah, I’m feeling it.
sheldon We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
howard Next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train.
sheldon I always prefer the train.
leonard Sheldon, let’s go.
sheldon Coming.
howard Why did you bring that?
sheldon No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.
leonard Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody.
sheldon So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
leonard No.
sheldon Well, now I just feel silly holding it.
leonard Come on.
sheldon Can I at least kick down the door?
leonard You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.
voice_inside Who is it?
sheldon Your doom!
raj Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
sheldon Good point. Basket of puppies.
huge_man What?
leonard Uh, Sheldon?
sheldon Are you Todd Zarnecki?
todd Yeah. Who are you?
sheldon I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
todd I don’t think so. Let me see that.
sheldon Careful. That’s a collectible.
todd I know. I’ve always wanted one.
sheldon Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought.
sheldon You know, the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless.
howard Yeah, he walked right into our trap.
raj Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
leonard Oh-oh.
raj What’s the matter?
leonard Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?
sheldon Of course.
raj Very basic.
howard 19th-century technology.
leonard Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
sheldon No.
howard No, not a clue.
leonard Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up.
sheldon It’d be swell if they had a train.
sheldon Thank you, Penny.
penny No problem. So, Leonard, I think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you.
leonard Uh, I kind of told her I was working.
penny So you lied to her. Also interesting.
leonard Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.
penny Well, doesn’t matter if she gets it, as long as she’s pretty.
howard This one’s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn’t make it work with her?
penny So did you at least get Sheldon’s fake stuff back?
sheldon No. We failed in our noble quest.
penny How come?
sheldon Todd Zarnecki was mean.
penny All right. Hang on.
leonard What are you doing?
penny I’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. This ain’t no Beyonce.
todd Now what?
penny Give my friend his stuff back.
todd I don’t know what you’re talking about.
penny Well, then, good news. Today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place. Now give him his stuff back.
todd Okay.
sheldon We did it! I said, we.
priya Oh, hold the door.
penny Oh, hi.
priya Hi.
penny Going to see Leonard?
priya Yes. How have you been?
penny Fine. You?
priya Very well, thank you.
penny Alright, well great seeing you.
priya Yeah, you too.
penny Amy’s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
