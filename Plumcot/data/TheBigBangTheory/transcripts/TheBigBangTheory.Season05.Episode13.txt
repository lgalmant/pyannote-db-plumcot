leonard_hofstadter You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
sheldon_cooper You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s talk about that.
sheldon_cooper As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.
leonard_hofstadter We all do. Now, how about dinner?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me.
sheldon_cooper Permission granted, Commander.
amy_farrah_fowler Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?
penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
leonard_hofstadter No, I mean just you and me.
penny You mean, like a date?
leonard_hofstadter Not like a date, a date.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh!
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh!
penny Um, o-okay. Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh!
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh!
sheldon_cooper Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.
amy_farrah_fowler How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
bernadette_rostenkowski Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?
penny Just a sec. Too much?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler No.
penny Okay, just hang on.
amy_farrah_fowler You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?
bernadette_rostenkowski When did you and Leonard break up?
penny Uh, about two years ago.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why do you think he asked you out again?
penny I don’t know.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.
penny He’s not dying.
amy_farrah_fowler Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.
penny How about this?
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on.
penny Yeah, okay, no.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
penny Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.
amy_farrah_fowler If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.
penny Okay, he is not dying.
amy_farrah_fowler How do you know? Are you a doctor?
bernadette_rostenkowski You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network.
penny Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.
amy_farrah_fowler With a dead man.
penny Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.
bernadette_rostenkowski Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.
penny I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
amy_farrah_fowler Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.
sheldon_cooper Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, how do I look?
howard_wolowitz Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
raj_koothrappali Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship.
raj_koothrappali I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement.
sheldon_cooper You want to know my opinion?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, boy, do I?
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
howard_wolowitz No.
sheldon_cooper All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.
leonard_hofstadter Where on earth did you get that from?
sheldon_cooper It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.
leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t make it true.
sheldon_cooper It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter See you later.
raj_koothrappali If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.
howard_wolowitz Why?
raj_koothrappali Because she’s great in everything.
sheldon_cooper Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?
leonard_hofstadter So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?
penny Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that sounds right.
penny Yeah?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter So, Polly, tell me about yourself.
penny It’s Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.
penny Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
penny Wow. Can they?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.
penny Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?
leonard_hofstadter Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.
penny What does that mean?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.
penny You are so funny.
leonard_hofstadter Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
penny Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.
leonard_hofstadter Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?
penny Whoa. Not so fast.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, what did I say?
penny Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, God.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.
penny So?
leonard_hofstadter So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.
penny How would you say it?
leonard_hofstadter I have feelings for you.
penny It’s the same thing.
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s not. Always made it worse.
penny You’re overthinking this.
leonard_hofstadter No, I’m not.
penny Yes, you are. You always overthink things.
leonard_hofstadter Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
penny See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.
penny Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.
sheldon_cooper And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement.
raj_koothrappali He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?
leonard_hofstadter You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
raj_koothrappali I guess it didn’t go well.
sheldon_cooper We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
howard_wolowitz How about now?
sheldon_cooper Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game.
raj_koothrappali You were in the middle of an erection.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand.
leonard_hofstadter What does she want from me now? What’s up?
penny Do not overthink this.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t understand.
penny Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, but earlier it seemed like…
penny No talking.
leonard_hofstadter Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
penny Well, that was fun.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.
penny You hung in there, though.
leonard_hofstadter Well, there was a lot at stake.
penny So what do you want to do now?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?
penny I don’t know, it’s complicated.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.
penny Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.
leonard_hofstadter Why? What are you afraid of?
penny Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?
leonard_hofstadter What if I dump you?
penny Come on, be serious.
leonard_hofstadter Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.
penny So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
leonard_hofstadter Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
penny Well, we don’t really have to pretend.
leonard_hofstadter And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
penny Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe you kept this.
penny Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.
leonard_hofstadter That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?
sheldon_cooper Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?
leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?
sheldon_cooper I was using the bathroom.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, so was I.
sheldon_cooper Really? I didn’t see you in there.
leonard_hofstadter Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
sheldon_cooper Where?
leonard_hofstadter The, the gas station across the street.
sheldon_cooper In your pyjamas?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Without shoes?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper On a cold winter’s night?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
sheldon_cooper Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want beef jerky.
sheldon_cooper It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
sheldon_cooper Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.
sheldon_cooper Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.
howard_wolowitz Why?
sheldon_cooper We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship.
sheldon_cooper You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.
leonard_hofstadter We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
sheldon_cooper Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine.
howard_wolowitz I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends.
bernadette_rostenkowski Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.
howard_wolowitz Why not?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m a very vengeful person.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski With access to weaponised smallpox.
penny Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?
howard_wolowitz Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
penny No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s nice.
leonard_hofstadter See, she knew what always meant.
penny Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?
leonard_hofstadter I’m just making a point.
penny Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
sheldon_cooper People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order.
penny Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that is not true.
sheldon_cooper I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
penny You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.
leonard_hofstadter Well…
sheldon_cooper Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.
leonard_hofstadter Unbelievable.
penny Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?
penny No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap.
penny The hell do you think you’re going?
leonard_hofstadter Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
penny Yeah, kind of, yeah.
leonard_hofstadter What are we doing?
penny What do you mean?
leonard_hofstadter Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
penny That’s because you overthink everything.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, are you listening to me?
leonard_hofstadter What? Yeah.
sheldon_cooper This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.
sheldon_cooper You’re right, I’ll give him a shot.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?
penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
leonard_hofstadter No, I mean just you and me.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh!
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh!
penny Uh, have you thought this through?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, and I think we should go anyway.
sheldon_cooper No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back.
amy_farrah_fowler If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about me and Howard?
amy_farrah_fowler Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where are you guys going to eat?
amy_farrah_fowler Penny?
minister#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?
penny Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?
amy_farrah_fowler Penny?
penny Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.
