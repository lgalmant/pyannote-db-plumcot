howard_wolowitz And now the kung pao chicken.
leonard_hofstadter Alright.
raj_koothrappali Smooth.
howard_wolowitz And finally, my moo shu pork.
raj_koothrappali Whoo-hoo!
howard_wolowitz Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.
raj_koothrappali And it only took 28 minutes.
sheldon_cooper Impressive, but we must be cautious.
howard_wolowitz Why?
sheldon_cooper Today, it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper No one ever does. That’s why it happens.
penny Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What’s that?
howard_wolowitz That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.
penny Ah, cool.
howard_wolowitz Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
penny Oh, does that come up much on the space station?
howard_wolowitz Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.
penny All right. Pass the soy sauce.
howard_wolowitz Coming up.
leonard_hofstadter So how’s work?
penny Oh, it’s not bad. Kind of hungry.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we all are.
howard_wolowitz Just wait.
sheldon_cooper You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.
penny Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
sheldon_cooper I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
howard_wolowitz Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.
penny Oh ha-ha, oh. That’s amazing.
sheldon_cooper I wouldn’t say amazing. At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yes? Peace?
howard_wolowitz No, not peace. Hang on.
penny Does NASA know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
howard_wolowitz You kidding? They still think it’s in a secure locker at JPL.
penny You stole it?
howard_wolowitz Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Oh. Amy’s at the dry cleaners, and she’s made a very amusing pun. “I don’t care for perchloroethylene, and I don’t like glycol ether.” Get it? She doesn’t like glycol ether. Sounds like either. L-O-L.
penny Who’s Amy?
leonard_hofstadter His girlfriend.
penny Sheldon has a girlfriend?
sheldon_cooper She’s not my girlfriend.
penny How long has this been going on?
leonard_hofstadter Four months.
sheldon_cooper She’s not my girlfriend.
penny Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?
sheldon_cooper She’s not my girlfriend.
penny Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?
howard_wolowitz Raj and I entered Sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.
penny Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.
howard_wolowitz Or, as we call them, Shamy.
penny Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
sheldon_cooper All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.
penny Okay, well, what do you communicate about?
sheldon_cooper Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.
penny Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
sheldon_cooper Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.
howard_wolowitz I’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
penny Okay, I have a question.
sheldon_cooper Yes, Penny.
penny You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
sheldon_cooper Why on Earth would we have sex?
penny Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?
sheldon_cooper I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.
penny Oh, God.
sheldon_cooper Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?
leonard_hofstadter Still digging the Shamy?
penny Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her.
sheldon_cooper You mean dating?
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper I can’t date Amy.
penny Why not?
sheldon_cooper She’s not my girlfriend.
penny Okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.
sheldon_cooper Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
penny Probably not.
sheldon_cooper Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
sheldon_cooper I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
penny Yeah, my point is it’s a waste of time.
sheldon_cooper If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now.
penny What do you want?
sheldon_cooper I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
penny Oh, that’s great. Have fun.
sheldon_cooper Wait. You have to drive me.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper You know I don’t drive.
penny Well, go ask Leonard.
sheldon_cooper I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.
penny Leonard said cockamamie?
sheldon_cooper Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.
penny Okay, fine. When’s the date?
sheldon_cooper Now.
penny Now?
sheldon_cooper Hurry. We’re going to be late.
penny Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?
penny Well, no, not per se, but…
sheldon_cooper So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
penny Let me get my cockamamie keys.
howard_wolowitz Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that’s the spot. Oh, baby.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, dinner’s ready!
howard_wolowitz I’ll eat later. I’m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for driving me.
penny You’re welcome.
sheldon_cooper I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
penny Can I ask you a question?
sheldon_cooper Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.
penny Yeah. Well, my question is, and I’m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?
sheldon_cooper That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Then, this is my first date.
penny Okay. Well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know.
sheldon_cooper I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.
penny My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.
sheldon_cooper If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?
penny Fair point.
raj_koothrappali You know, there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
raj_koothrappali Where does he poop?
leonard_hofstadter What?
raj_koothrappali What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?
leonard_hofstadter Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what’s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? You’re not going to believe this.
penny So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other.
amy_farrah_fowler Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
penny Yeah, it’s okay.
amy_farrah_fowler But the light indicates…
sheldon_cooper Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
penny Um, what is that scent you’re wearing? It smells great.
amy_farrah_fowler Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
penny Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you a homosexual?
penny No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.
amy_farrah_fowler Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
penny Guys, how ’bout some music?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler No, thank you.
penny Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
sheldon_cooper No.
penny Well, why don’t you tell her?
sheldon_cooper All right. It was hell.
penny Any follow up, Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
penny I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?
penny I don’t know. I was just trying something.
sheldon_cooper Muggles.
raj_koothrappali You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
howard_wolowitz Yes.
raj_koothrappali Penis first?
howard_wolowitz Yes. Now, help me!
leonard_hofstadter I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.
howard_wolowitz Not funny, Leonard.
raj_koothrappali Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That’s funny, ask anyone.
howard_wolowitz Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s see.
howard_wolowitz No, no! Don’t touch, the program is paused.
leonard_hofstadter Well, then let’s un-pause it.
howard_wolowitz No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting.
raj_koothrappali A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.
leonard_hofstadter You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.
raj_koothrappali All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?
howard_wolowitz What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
leonard_hofstadter How about an acetylene torch?
howard_wolowitz Okay, I can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.
leonard_hofstadter Well, then what do you want us to do?
howard_wolowitz I…
debbie_wolowitz Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!
howard_wolowitz That’s great, Mom, thanks!
debbie_wolowitz I’ll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!
howard_wolowitz Don’t come up here!
debbie_wolowitz Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!
howard_wolowitz Yes, but that’s not the point! Get me out of here.
leonard_hofstadter You have any ideas, Raj?
raj_koothrappali Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
penny Hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s an amusing factoid.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss.
amy_farrah_fowler Is this true?
sheldon_cooper Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count.
penny So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?
amy_farrah_fowler Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?
penny Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few. . What’s
sheldon_cooper Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
penny What? Where did you get 171 men?
sheldon_cooper Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…
penny Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. 16?
penny 14.
sheldon_cooper My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.
amy_farrah_fowler Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…
penny Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point.
sheldon_cooper So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.
penny Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here.
amy_farrah_fowler This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?
penny No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?
sheldon_cooper This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
amy_farrah_fowler Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
sheldon_cooper I should think so.
amy_farrah_fowler Then 128.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, come on. Almost there.
howard_wolowitz Don’t tug. No tugging.
raj_koothrappali Next time, take your own advice.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, could you help us out?
althea My, my, my. What do we have here?
howard_wolowitz I slipped and fell.
althea Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?
howard_wolowitz It’s a robot arm.
althea Where’s the rest of the robot?
howard_wolowitz I only built the arm.
althea ‘Cause that’s all you needed, right?
howard_wolowitz Can you please just help me?
althea All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man’s penis out here.
howard_wolowitz You think you could be a little more discreet?
althea I’m sorry, we don’t have a code for robot hand grasping a man’s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, it’s what controls the arm.
howard_wolowitz But it’s frozen.
althea Did you try turning it off and back on again?
howard_wolowitz No, you see, it’s more complicated than that. No, wait! Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.
raj_koothrappali Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
sheldon_cooper You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
penny I did not have sex with 31 guys.
sheldon_cooper I’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.
penny And that is?
sheldon_cooper Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
penny You’re still on that?
sheldon_cooper In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?
penny Okay, you know what? I’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I’m gonna tell your mother on you.
sheldon_cooper That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
penny Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
sheldon_cooper Curses.
penny If I’d thought of that in the first place, I could’ve saved myself this whole night.
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Howard, what’s up?
sheldon_cooper I’ve decided not to procreate.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?
