sheldon Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves.
leonard I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.
howard Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?
raj Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.
leonard Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
howard Apparently, if you’re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.
penny Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can’t get on.
leonard Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.
penny Thanks. What are you guys doing?
leonard Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
penny Oh. How’d he do?
howard Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.
penny That bad, huh?
leonard Read this woman’s tweet.
penny Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.
howard So, how’d the lecture go?
leonard In a word, triumphant.
leonard Really? Triumphant?
sheldon Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.
penny Oh, please let me tell him.
leonard I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard.
sheldon Tell me what?
howard Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.
sheldon Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN.
leonard Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
sheldon Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.
howard FYI, I think that’s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.
howard Sheldon still moping?
leonard Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.
raj Mmm, I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.
bernadette Are you guys doing okay?
howard Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.
bernadette Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie.
raj Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.
howard Labradoodle?
leonard We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
bernadette Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
raj You really think so?
bernadette Yeah. You’re a hottie.
raj Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.
amy So, what do you think?
sheldon It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.
amy Not even when I do this?
sheldon No.
amy Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.
sheldon Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
amy If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.
sheldon For instance?
amy Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.
sheldon Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.
amy All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?
sheldon Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
amy Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.
sheldon I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
amy Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
sheldon Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What?
sheldon You’re an actress, correct?
penny I’m not an actress. I’m an actress.
sheldon All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.
penny You want an acting lesson?
sheldon Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.
penny Okay, where is this coming from?
sheldon It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.
penny Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge.
sheldon So, when could we start?
penny Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t.
sheldon I suppose that’s one way to look at it.
penny I think it’s the only way to look at it.
sheldon Are you going to help me or not?
penny Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
sheldon Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road.
penny Forget it.
sheldon I’ll pay you 40 dollars.
penny Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.
howard Raj, I have amazing news!
raj What?
howard I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
raj Dude, that’s incredible!
howard I know. The only thing is, I’m gonna be gone for two years.
raj Aw, I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?
bernadette I have to stay here for school.
howard That’s what we’re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.
raj What kind of needs?
howard Sexual needs.
bernadette Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.
howard So, while I’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her.
bernadette What do you say?
raj I say okey-dokey.
howard What ya thinking so hard about?
raj Just that I’m definitely not gay.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s wrong?
sheldon Nothing. I was acting.
penny You were acting?
sheldon Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s
penny Well, good for you. Come on in.
sheldon How shall we begin?
penny Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.
sheldon All right.
penny So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?
sheldon You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
penny Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.
sheldon Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.
penny All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up.
sheldon You’re the teacher.
penny Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?
sheldon Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
penny This is all about listening and responding.
sheldon Gotcha.
penny I’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.
sheldon All right.
penny All right.
sheldon Action.
penny Okay, it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action.
sheldon Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?
penny Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
sheldon I’d like a frozen yogurt, please.
penny Yogurt?
sheldon Yeah.
penny Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.
sheldon You do?
penny Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.
sheldon All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
penny What?
sheldon It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
penny Okay, you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.
sheldon Oh, and we’re going to use props?
penny You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?
sheldon You have any frozen yogurt?
leonard I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
raj Uh-huh.
leonard Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?
raj What happened?
leonard Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.
raj Oh, no!
bernadette Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?
leonard Have you seen him?
bernadette They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.
leonard It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
raj It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. It’s Howard. Howard, hello.
howard Raj, is that you?
raj Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?
howard Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it.
raj No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.
howard Raj, I don’t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.
raj Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…
bernadette Sexually.
raj Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.
howard Sexually.
raj Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.
bernadette That’s how I heard it.
leonard Or it could be sy-fee.
raj What?
leonard S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
raj Oh, right. Good one.
penny So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?
sheldon Yes. I didn’t care for it.
penny Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
sheldon So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either.
penny Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
sheldon I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
penny And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?
sheldon Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
penny Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
sheldon It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.
penny KMN.
sheldon Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.
penny Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone.
sheldon Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
penny Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
sheldon I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?
penny It’s only logical.
sheldon Very well. I’ll set the scene.
penny All right.
sheldon East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.
penny Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.
sheldon Hoo!
penny Now just read your mother’s line.
sheldon Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.
penny Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
sheldon Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!
penny Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.
sheldon I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.
penny Just keep going!
sheldon Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.
penny We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.
sheldon I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”
penny Okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.
sheldon Why?
penny Well, you’re losing your son.
sheldon Yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much.
penny All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you’re sad to see him go. I’m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That’s your cue.
sheldon I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
penny All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.
sheldon Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.
penny That’s good. That’s good. That’s good.
sheldon Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.
penny Okay, I guess we’re improvising now.
sheldon Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo.
penny Mrs. Cooper, hey, it’s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.
sheldon Mommy, I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!
bernadette Okay, Raj, I know you’ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours.
raj Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
bernadette Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
raj My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
bernadette My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
raj You are my heart!
bernadette My universe!
raj You are my heart!
bernadette My universe!
both_together My universe!
chorus_of_everyone_in_cafeteria Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!
raj Dance number aside, I’m so not gay.
