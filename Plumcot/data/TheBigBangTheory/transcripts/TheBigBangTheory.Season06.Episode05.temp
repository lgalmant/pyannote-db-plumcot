howard Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.
stuart Well, Howard, that’s very nice of you.
leonard Yeah, maybe. Open it first.
howard It’s my official NASA portrait.
stuart To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”
sheldon For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
howard That’s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
raj Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.
stuart Yeah, it’s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time’s the charm.
raj Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
stuart Thanks, but I can’t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?
raj You know, you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything.
stuart Really?
raj Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.
howard But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one porn channel.
leonard Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
sheldon Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.
leonard Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?
howard Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view.
sheldon It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?
howard Not really.
sheldon Oh, well.
howard You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.
amy Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?
penny I hope so.
amy Question. Do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
penny It’s not getting any better. Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.
bernadette I thought you liked Halloween.
penny I do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.
bernadette Like my husband?
amy And my boyfriend?
penny I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s foreskin?
bernadette Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going.
penny Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time.
bernadette Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.
penny Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?
amy Then what’s your job?
penny Letting him make me happy.
bernadette I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
amy That’s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.
penny I guess I could probably try a little harder.
bernadette You could start by taking an interest in his work.
penny Yeah, that’s kind of a problem.
amy Why?
penny Not really clear on what he does.
bernadette He’s an experimental physicist.
penny Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.
amy He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
penny Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.
sheldon What kind of tea would you like?
amy I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
sheldon Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.
amy So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.
sheldon I couldn’t agree more.
amy Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
sheldon Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.
amy Yeah?
sheldon R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
amy Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don’t even like.
sheldon Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.
amy I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?
sheldon Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?
penny Anybody home?
leonard Hey, what are you doing here?
penny I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.
leonard Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before.
penny No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.
leonard No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
penny You’re kidding.
leonard Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
penny Ooh! What’s going on in here?
leonard Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.
penny What, is it secret?
leonard No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.
penny Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
leonard Sign right there.
penny Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?
leonard Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
penny Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?
leonard That is a pencil sharpener.
penny Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?
leonard It’s actually pretty neat.
penny Yeah?
leonard Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.
penny Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
leonard Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila.
penny Wow. That is amazing.
leonard You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.
penny What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!
leonard Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really just be information on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
penny Hmm.
leonard What?
penny Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
leonard You should visit more often. What are you doing?
penny Take off your clothes.
leonard What? Here? Now?
penny Yeah. You got a problem with that?
leonard No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.
penny Really? Never?
leonard No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.
raj Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.
howard Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.
raj On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
sheldon Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
raj It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
sheldon I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.
raj Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?
howard That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?
leonard Hello, boys.
sheldon What are you smiling at?
leonard Nothing.
howard You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.
all Space.
howard Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?
bernadette Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.
howard So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?
bernadette Okay, we need to talk.
howard What?
bernadette Howie, I know you went to space. I’m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.
howard I don’t talk about it every minute.
bernadette Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
howard What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.
bernadette I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.
howard So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?
bernadette Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
howard Okay, no problem. It won’t happen again.
bernadette I love you.
howard I love you, too. I can’t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What, I can’t even point?
leonard So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.
penny Whoa! That’s heavy.
leonard Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?
penny No. Why?
leonard A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.
penny Whoa! That is very cool.
leonard Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.
penny Getting a little less cool, Leonard.
leonard But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
penny There we go.
raj So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.
sheldon A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.
raj Do you have a preference?
howard I don’t care. Get the Tardis.
sheldon Yes! This party just became a major rager.
raj Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?
howard Yeah, sure, whatever.
raj I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
howard Clever.
raj What’s wrong with you?
howard Nothing.
raj Oh, Howard, I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you.
howard Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?
sheldon Yes.
raj No.
sheldon We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.
raj It’s called being nice.
sheldon Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it.
howard You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.
sheldon Look at that, the problem solved itself.
leonard Hello, boys.
sheldon What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
amy You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.
sheldon No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause.
amy No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.
sheldon What’s a hickey?
bernadette How do I look?
howard Fine.
bernadette Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that’s like the funniest thing I’ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?
howard To tell you the truth, I’m not really in the mood.
bernadette What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your friends’ll be there.
howard Yeah, some friends. They all think I’m boring. Maybe you should go without me.
bernadette No, if I’m there alone, people might think I’m just a really short person from Avatar.
howard I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.
bernadette Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I’m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.
howard Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.
bernadette Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking.
penny Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.
bernadette Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?
penny No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.
bernadette And Albert Einstein?
leonard Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.
penny I thought we said in the car, no accents?
leonard Sorry, Officer.
girl_dressed_as_a_witch Hello. It’s a great party.
stuart Thank you.
witch The monster foods, they’re really fun.
stuart Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I’m fun. I’m not clinically depressed at all.
amy Sheldon, get in here.
sheldon I should’ve picked hickey.
stuart Hey, hey, look at you guys!
amy I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO.
sheldon It was a compromise. I lost.
raj Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
howard Who cares?
raj What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
howard You’re right, the party’s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.
raj Is this about the space thing again?
howard Well, I’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!
bernadette Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?
howard Great, now I’m in trouble. You happy?
bernadette You, out! You are being very rude.
howard No, I’m not. They’re all being rude. And you’re being rude.
bernadette Me? What did I do?
howard Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.
bernadette I don’t sound like that.
howard You’re my wife. You’re supposed to be on my side.
bernadette I’m always on your side.
howard Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I’m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I’m just…
bernadette Just what?
howard Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
bernadette Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
howard You’re just saying that.
bernadette No, I’m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.
howard I love you.
bernadette I love you, too.
penny Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.
leonard Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.
bernadette Hey, what you watching?
howard I don’t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.
buzz Here you go. It’s a Milky Way. The Milky Way’s a galaxy in space. I’ve been in space. Here’s a Mars bar. I’m an astronaut. And this one’s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?
howard Okay, I get it.
