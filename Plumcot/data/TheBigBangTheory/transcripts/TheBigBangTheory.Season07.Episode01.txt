leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?
sheldon_cooper Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important.
leonard_hofstadter What is it?
sheldon_cooper Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here.
sheldon_cooper You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?
leonard_hofstadter What was what?
sheldon_cooper This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k…
sheldon_cooper No!
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What’s the matter?
sheldon_cooper Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.
penny Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
sheldon_cooper To be honest, I did.
penny Aw.
sheldon_cooper Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
penny Good night.
sheldon_cooper No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.
penny You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Good night.
raj_koothrappali I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all.
howard_wolowitz I’m proud of you.
raj_koothrappali Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.
sheldon_cooper Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.
raj_koothrappali Is that true?
sheldon_cooper Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.
howard_wolowitz Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new.
raj_koothrappali How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.
howard_wolowitz Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.
raj_koothrappali You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
howard_wolowitz Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.
raj_koothrappali You would do that for me?
howard_wolowitz Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.
raj_koothrappali Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?
sheldon_cooper I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs.
bernadette_rostenkowski The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun.
amy_farrah_fowler Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.
amy_farrah_fowler Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.
sheldon_cooper Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…
penny No.
sheldon_cooper Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.
penny Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
sheldon_cooper You overestimate his significance in my life.
penny Mmm.
sheldon_cooper Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?
penny Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.
sheldon_cooper Well, I try.
penny All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.
sheldon_cooper Great. I’ll go first.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper By the way, how are you with zippers?
penny Why?
sheldon_cooper Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.
raj_koothrappali Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 It is. You can download my paper off the university server.
raj_koothrappali I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 I will.
raj_koothrappali All right.
howard_wolowitz How’d it go?
raj_koothrappali Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.
howard_wolowitz Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
raj_koothrappali Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.
howard_wolowitz I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.
raj_koothrappali That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.
janine_davis Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.
howard_wolowitz Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.
raj_koothrappali You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.
janine_davis Okay.
raj_koothrappali So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.
howard_wolowitz It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.
bernadette_rostenkowski I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag.
bernadette_rostenkowski To the advancement of science.
amy_farrah_fowler And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.
amy_farrah_fowler Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.
waiter From the two gentlemen at the bar.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
bernadette_rostenkowski Be cool.
amy_farrah_fowler You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Ooh. Bad move.
penny Really? Why?
sheldon_cooper My queen can now take your rook from below.
penny So that means I lose, right? It’s over?
sheldon_cooper If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.
penny Okay, let’s take a break.
sheldon_cooper We’re all out of alcohol.
penny I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.
penny I’m calling him.
sheldon_cooper Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?
penny Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.
all@ Hi, Penny!
penny Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.
leonard_hofstadter Best time of my life.
sheldon_cooper Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
leonard_hofstadter Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!
penny Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.
random_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 Iceberg!
leonard_hofstadter Uh-oh, hang on.
sheldon_cooper Are you in danger?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!
all@ Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!
penny Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
sheldon_cooper You were.
amy_farrah_fowler So what happened? How’d it go?
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
amy_farrah_fowler So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.
amy_farrah_fowler And why would no one blame me?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what I’m saying.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.
bernadette_rostenkowski Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.
amy_farrah_fowler No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.
bernadette_rostenkowski I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?
amy_farrah_fowler We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks.
amy_farrah_fowler Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
penny I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
sheldon_cooper That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
penny No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
sheldon_cooper Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.
penny Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?
sheldon_cooper Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?
penny No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.
penny This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?
sheldon_cooper Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?
penny Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.
sheldon_cooper Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.
penny He did?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Oh, that’s really sweet.
sheldon_cooper Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.
penny Well, now I miss him even more.
sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.
penny Thanks.
sheldon_cooper Oh, seriously?
raj_koothrappali Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?
janine_davis What?
raj_koothrappali I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.
janine_davis Forget about it.
raj_koothrappali You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.
janine_davis Is that right?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.
sheldon_cooper Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
penny Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
sheldon_cooper Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.
penny How about we just talk?
sheldon_cooper All right. In 4D chess…
penny No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper I own nine pairs of pants.
penny Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.
sheldon_cooper I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
penny How about I go first?
sheldon_cooper But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.
penny Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.
sheldon_cooper I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
penny Oh, God.
sheldon_cooper And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.
penny That’s your big revelation?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.
penny Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.
sheldon_cooper Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
penny What did I do?
sheldon_cooper I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.
penny I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.
sheldon_cooper It is to me; that’s the point.
penny Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.
sheldon_cooper Your apology is accepted.
penny Thank you. How about a hug?
sheldon_cooper How about a hearty handshake?
penny Come on.
sheldon_cooper Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good night.
amy_farrah_fowler Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, that felt nice.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?
amy_farrah_fowler I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.
amy_farrah_fowler Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.
bernadette_rostenkowski Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
amy_farrah_fowler Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 Good night.
janine_davis All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.
janine_davis Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.
raj_koothrappali Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.
janine_davis Are you hitting on me?
raj_koothrappali No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.
janine_davis You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
raj_koothrappali Good night.
howard_wolowitz Looks like she accepted your apology.
raj_koothrappali And then some. I think we had a moment.
howard_wolowitz Oh, please, you did not have a moment.
raj_koothrappali Who died and made you king of moments?
howard_wolowitz Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.
raj_koothrappali There was.
howard_wolowitz There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?
raj_koothrappali I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
howard_wolowitz So nothing.
raj_koothrappali No, not a thing.
penny Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.
leonard_hofstadter That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
all@ Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!
penny Aaaaaaah!
