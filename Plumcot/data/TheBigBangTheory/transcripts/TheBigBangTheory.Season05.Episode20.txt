penny Oh my God, I love this chicken.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.
penny Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.
raj_koothrappali I’ll let you know.
howard_wolowitz Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette mom, and the other three, mine.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.
sheldon_cooper They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.
howard_wolowitz Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.
raj_koothrappali Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.
leonard_hofstadter Who you bringing?
raj_koothrappali Who are you bringing?
penny He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
raj_koothrappali Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.
howard_wolowitz Come on, who is it?
raj_koothrappali I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
sheldon_cooper Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?
howard_wolowitz No, uh, I don’t think so.
sheldon_cooper Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.
raj_koothrappali Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?
mrs_koothrappali Pretty good, can’t complain.
dr_vm_koothrappali Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.
raj_koothrappali Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.
dr_vm_koothrappali It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?
mrs_koothrappali We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.
raj_koothrappali No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.
dr_vm_koothrappali What’s that?
raj_koothrappali It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
dr_vm_koothrappali Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?
raj_koothrappali ‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife.
mrs_koothrappali And just to clarify, a female wife?
raj_koothrappali Yes.
dr_vm_koothrappali Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.
mrs_koothrappali We married for love.
dr_vm_koothrappali And it’s been wonderful.
sheldon_cooper Quantum physics makes me so happy.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m glad.
sheldon_cooper It’s like looking at the universe naked.
penny Hi, you guys got a minute?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, what’s up?
penny Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Prove it.
sheldon_cooper Knock, knock.
leonard_hofstadter Who’s there?
sheldon_cooper Interrupting physicist.
leonard_hofstadter Interrupting physi…
sheldon_cooper MUON!
penny Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!
sheldon_cooper Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!
leonard_hofstadter Where did you get that?
penny Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.
leonard_hofstadter You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
penny Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
sheldon_cooper Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
penny Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?
sheldon_cooper Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
penny You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.
penny Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!
leonard_hofstadter Awesome!
sheldon_cooper Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.
penny Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.
leonard_hofstadter Ah!
sheldon_cooper Oh dear Lord. No!
penny Why, they’re just toys?
sheldon_cooper They’re mint in box.
leonard_hofstadter They’re Collectables.
penny C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 No!
leonard_hofstadter Once you open the box it loses its value.
penny Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
raj_koothrappali Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.
bernadette_rostenkowski The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
howard_wolowitz Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
raj_koothrappali Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.
howard_wolowitz Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
raj_koothrappali It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
howard_wolowitz Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?
raj_koothrappali Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 Excuse me, are you Rajesh?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.
lakshmi_choudry Nice to meet you too.
raj_koothrappali Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hello.
raj_koothrappali And this is Howard.
howard_wolowitz Nice to meet you.
lakshmi_choudry You too.
raj_koothrappali Please have a seat. I’m thinking double wedding!
mr_spock Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?
sheldon_cooper Is someone there?
mr_spock Down here, on your desk.
sheldon_cooper Spock?
mr_spock I need to speak with you.
sheldon_cooper Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
mr_spock It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.
sheldon_cooper Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
mr_spock I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.
sheldon_cooper But it’s mint in box.
mr_spock Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.
mr_spock Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?
sheldon_cooper To be played with.
mr_spock Therefore? To not play with it would be?
sheldon_cooper Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.
mr_spock Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. . Energise. Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. It’s only logical.
lakshmi_choudry My goodness, that was delicious.
raj_koothrappali Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
lakshmi_choudry Impressive. What goes into making something like that.
raj_koothrappali Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.
lakshmi_choudry I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.
raj_koothrappali Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls.
lakshmi_choudry Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.
raj_koothrappali I’d like to tell them things are going well.
lakshmi_choudry Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.
raj_koothrappali Okay, what page are you on?
lakshmi_choudry I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay.
raj_koothrappali Say again.
lakshmi_choudry I’m gay.
raj_koothrappali Like, dude on dude, but with women?
lakshmi_choudry I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.
raj_koothrappali Why me, of all people?
lakshmi_choudry Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.
raj_koothrappali I’m not gay.
lakshmi_choudry Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am.
raj_koothrappali That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex.
lakshmi_choudry Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?
raj_koothrappali I like to boogie.
lakshmi_choudry Got you.
raj_koothrappali W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
lakshmi_choudry That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.
raj_koothrappali Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.
sheldon_cooper Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
mr_spock Hello again, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What is it now, tiny Spock?
mr_spock I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.
sheldon_cooper You’re the one who told me to play with it.
mr_spock If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?
sheldon_cooper No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.
mr_spock Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.
mr_spock Well I am unhappy.
sheldon_cooper I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
mr_spock I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.
sheldon_cooper You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.
mr_spock Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.
sheldon_cooper Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
raj_koothrappali Ready for lunch?
howard_wolowitz Yep, one sec. Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.
raj_koothrappali Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
raj_koothrappali We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.
howard_wolowitz What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?
raj_koothrappali Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.
howard_wolowitz Then why did she even go out with you?
raj_koothrappali She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy.
raj_koothrappali Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
howard_wolowitz Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.
raj_koothrappali It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.
raj_koothrappali Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
howard_wolowitz So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
howard_wolowitz Yes, to other gay people.
raj_koothrappali Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. Nothing!
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Nothing. I said nothing.
penny That was weird.
leonard_hofstadter Really? I don’t even notice any more.
penny I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
leonard_hofstadter Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box.
penny I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. Relax. I’m just looking at the box.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
penny What is your problem?
sheldon_cooper My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.
penny Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.
leonard_hofstadter You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Mmmmm!
leonard_hofstadter It’s broken.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Oh, nice job, man-hands.
penny I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.
sheldon_cooper Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.
penny You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely.
sheldon_cooper Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you open mine?
sheldon_cooper I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you should talk to Stuart.
sheldon_cooper I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
penny What is the truth?
sheldon_cooper My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, that I believe.
penny Mmm.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.
leonard_hofstadter So, is that one mine.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Well, hand it over so I can open it.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.
leonard_hofstadter And that’s a lie, right?
sheldon_cooper Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
raj_koothrappali This is a treat, what brings you guys by?
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi.
raj_koothrappali What, you told her?
howard_wolowitz I told everybody.
bernadette_rostenkowski We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
howard_wolowitz Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman.
raj_koothrappali So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
howard_wolowitz Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
raj_koothrappali I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
bernadette_rostenkowski Metrosexual my ass.
