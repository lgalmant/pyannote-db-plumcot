raj_koothrappali What are you drawing over there?
sheldon_cooper It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
howard_wolowitz Oh, you silly doodlebug.
leonard_hofstadter You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
sheldon_cooper It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.
howard_wolowitz Do you expect me to build this?
sheldon_cooper I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
howard_wolowitz Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
leonard_hofstadter Really?
raj_koothrappali He probably just goes to the bathroom.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.
raj_koothrappali It’s sad that you know that.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
howard_wolowitz I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.
raj_koothrappali Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.
howard_wolowitz We should figure out where he goes.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
leonard_hofstadter Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
howard_wolowitz Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
raj_koothrappali It was tapenade and you guys suck.
penny So, how was work today?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
penny That sounds like fun.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it was.
penny Oh, good, I guessed right.
leonard_hofstadter Who you talking to?
penny Oh, just this guy I met at school.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?
penny Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.
penny Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.
penny No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.
leonard_hofstadter Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
penny It didn’t come up.
leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe you should tell him.
penny What am I supposed to say?
leonard_hofstadter Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.
penny Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. Thank you.
penny Mm-hmm. Hmm.
leonard_hofstadter What did he say?
penny Nothing.
leonard_hofstadter What?
penny Did your boyfriend make you type that?
leonard_hofstadter I hate this guy.
penny Don’t be like that.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.
penny No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Here?
penny If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.
leonard_hofstadter That’d be great. Thank you.
howard_wolowitz Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hello.
howard_wolowitz Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
sheldon_cooper No, thank you.
raj_koothrappali Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
sheldon_cooper I’m quite sure. Good day.
howard_wolowitz Well, where are you going?
sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
raj_koothrappali We just told you.
sheldon_cooper I just told you.
howard_wolowitz No, you didn’t.
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court.
howard_wolowitz Should we follow him?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
alex_jensen Hi, guys.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?
alex_jensen No.
howard_wolowitz Don’t you know his schedule?
alex_jensen All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.
howard_wolowitz Come on.
raj_koothrappali Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
howard_wolowitz This is where he goes? What’s in there?
raj_koothrappali I think it’s an old storage room.
howard_wolowitz What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
raj_koothrappali Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
howard_wolowitz Not yet. What are you doing?
raj_koothrappali I’m listening.
howard_wolowitz Can’t you face the other way and listen?
raj_koothrappali I can’t do anything right for you, can I?
howard_wolowitz What the hell is he up to?
raj_koothrappali He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
howard_wolowitz Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
raj_koothrappali Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.
leonard_hofstadter If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.
sheldon_cooper To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.
sheldon_cooper You think you don’t care?
leonard_hofstadter This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
sheldon_cooper Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.
sheldon_cooper Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
leonard_hofstadter I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
sheldon_cooper You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
leonard_hofstadter I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.
sheldon_cooper I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
leonard_hofstadter None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.
sheldon_cooper Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
leonard_hofstadter Now you’re just being ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.
raj_koothrappali Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
howard_wolowitz I think we’re more like ninjas.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.
howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
raj_koothrappali No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
raj_koothrappali But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.
howard_wolowitz It’s locked.
raj_koothrappali Are you sure?
howard_wolowitz Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…
raj_koothrappali It’s locked.
howard_wolowitz Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.
raj_koothrappali When did you learn how to pick locks?
howard_wolowitz When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.
raj_koothrappali How did that work out?
howard_wolowitz Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?
raj_koothrappali Hold on, hold on.
howard_wolowitz What?
raj_koothrappali Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so?
raj_koothrappali What if it’s booby-trapped?
howard_wolowitz Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.
raj_koothrappali Great, what’s your pl…
howard_wolowitz Are we good?
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. The solution to an equation?
raj_koothrappali Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
howard_wolowitz What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
raj_koothrappali He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
howard_wolowitz It’s paprika.
raj_koothrappali Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.
voice_from_outside#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 Okay, good night.
penny Thanks, Cole. See you at school.
cole See you.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll be right back.
sheldon_cooper I thought you left a long time ago.
leonard_hofstadter ‘sup?
cole Hey.
leonard_hofstadter You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
cole No, I was just visiting a friend.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?
cole Yeah. You know her?
leonard_hofstadter I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
cole Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. He’s ganged up.
cole She told me he’s a scientist.
leonard_hofstadter That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
cole Well, thanks for the tip.
leonard_hofstadter No problem, brother. Stay frosty. We’re still dating, right?
alex_jensen Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.
alex_jensen May I join you, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
alex_jensen Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.
alex_jensen Ooh, I love English accents.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.
alex_jensen It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.
alex_jensen I don’t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.
leonard_hofstadter Trust me, it doesn’t.
alex_jensen You sure? You’re cute, you’re funny. Maybe you’re getting hit on, and you don’t even know it.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
alex_jensen Yep, pretty sure.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.
alex_jensen No problem.
leonard_hofstadter Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
raj_koothrappali Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.
howard_wolowitz Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.
raj_koothrappali It’s the atomic number for technetium.
howard_wolowitz That stuff’s radioactive.
raj_koothrappali Do you think he’s building a bomb?
howard_wolowitz Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
howard_wolowitz Why would you know that?
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?
howard_wolowitz That’s forty-two, dumb-ass.
raj_koothrappali Hey, hey. Feelings.
howard_wolowitz We should stop. I’m exhausted.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
howard_wolowitz Not me.
raj_koothrappali Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
howard_wolowitz Sounds good.
raj_koothrappali What the balls is forty-three?
howard_wolowitz I have to know!
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
penny Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
leonard_hofstadter Come on, I’m sorry.
penny I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
leonard_hofstadter I do, of course I do.
penny Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
leonard_hofstadter Really?
penny Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.
penny What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.
penny Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.
leonard_hofstadter You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
penny That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you’re gonna start crying.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right, you should go.
penny All right.
leonard_hofstadter She loves me. Hey, it’s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I’m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.
howard_wolowitz Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working.
raj_koothrappali That’s good quality video.
howard_wolowitz It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.
raj_koothrappali How did you get your hands on that?
howard_wolowitz Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.
howard_wolowitz What the hell is that thing?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
howard_wolowitz Wormhole generator test?
sheldon_cooper The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God!
raj_koothrappali Holy crap!
sheldon_cooper Oh! It’s eating my face!
raj_koothrappali Aah! It’s eating his face!
sheldon_cooper I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, we’re really sorry.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, really sorry.
sheldon_cooper Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
howard_wolowitz But what are you doing in there?
raj_koothrappali And what does forty-three mean?
sheldon_cooper You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.
sheldon_cooper One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats.
