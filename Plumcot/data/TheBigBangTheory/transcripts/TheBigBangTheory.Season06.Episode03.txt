howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?
howard_wolowitz Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home.
howard_wolowitz I know.
bernadette_rostenkowski I got to get back to work. I love you.
howard_wolowitz Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?
bernadette_rostenkowski What do you want me to do?
howard_wolowitz Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?
bernadette_rostenkowski Really, you’re serious? Okay.
howard_wolowitz Oh, baby, you’re killing me.
penny Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you, Penny.
penny M-hmm.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.
penny Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.
penny Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
sheldon_cooper No, that’s my potty training journal.
penny Really, your potty training journal?
sheldon_cooper Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.
penny August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
sheldon_cooper There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.
penny Oh, disgusting.
leonard_hofstadter No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.
penny Why do you need all this stuff?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no.
penny Sorry!
sheldon_cooper I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
penny Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson.
sheldon_cooper Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
penny Yeah, that’s basically what I said.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
penny You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
sheldon_cooper Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.
leonard_hofstadter So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
sheldon_cooper That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
leonard_hofstadter Not gonna happen.
sheldon_cooper Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking.
leonard_hofstadter If you want help, just hire a grad student.
penny Maybe I could do it.
sheldon_cooper You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.
penny A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t I?
sheldon_cooper You said it, not me.
sheldon_cooper All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 No, thanks. I’m fine.
sheldon_cooper Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 I don’t do drugs.
sheldon_cooper Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you’re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 No, of course not. How did you know about that?
sheldon_cooper I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 Yes, I did.
sheldon_cooper Hearing unimpaired, good.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.
sheldon_cooper Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 It’s not flattery if it’s the truth.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.
leonard_hofstadter You talk to Howard lately?
raj_koothrappali Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. Hey, Sheldon, hope you’re hungry, they’re serving macaroni and… che-ee-ee-ese.
leonard_hofstadter Smooth. Hi.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?
sheldon_cooper No. I have people for that now. You’re up.
ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s new assistant.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.
alex_jensen It’s nice to meet you. I’m so excited to be working with Dr…
sheldon_cooper Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.
alex_jensen I should probably get to work.
leonard_hofstadter She seems nice.
raj_koothrappali Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
leonard_hofstadter All I said was she seems nice.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, I love her.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?
howard_wolowitz Uh, no, not really.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s wrong?
howard_wolowitz Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?
bernadette_rostenkowski Uh-huh.
howard_wolowitz It’s delayed. We’re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It’s the Russians, so you don’t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I’m down to my last three Tums.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
howard_wolowitz Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yeah. I’m a man-eater now.
penny Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist.
penny Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room.
alex_jensen Dr. Cooper’s office.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hello. Who are you?
alex_jensen I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s assistant. Can I help you?
amy_farrah_fowler I’d like to speak to Sheldon.
alex_jensen I’m sorry. He’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.
amy_farrah_fowler All right. Well, tell him Amy called.
alex_jensen Last name?
amy_farrah_fowler He knows my last name. I’m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I’ll send you a PDF.
alex_jensen All right, I will tell him you called.
amy_farrah_fowler Hmm, that’s weird.
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn’t mention that Alex was a girl.
penny Maybe he didn’t notice.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re right. I don’t have to worry about Sheldon.
penny No, you do not.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s her I have to worry about.
penny Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, really? Look at this face How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?
penny Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.
penny Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. Aha!
penny Can we go now?
amy_farrah_fowler Hang on.
penny What are you doing?
amy_farrah_fowler Isn’t it obvious? I’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.
penny Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.
raj_koothrappali Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?
sheldon_cooper Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?
raj_koothrappali I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.
alex_jensen Here’s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.
leonard_hofstadter This should be fun.
sheldon_cooper Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?
alex_jensen Yes.
sheldon_cooper Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
alex_jensen Rainbow, not chocolate.
sheldon_cooper Two cherries?
alex_jensen One on top, one on the bottom.
sheldon_cooper Stems removed?
alex_jensen Um, top one, yes. I didn’t check the one on the bottom.
leonard_hofstadter Oh!
alex_jensen I’m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
sheldon_cooper It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?
alex_jensen Um…
sheldon_cooper Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?
leonard_hofstadter Given her what?
sheldon_cooper If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, sure. Please join us.
alex_jensen Oh, okay. Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?
alex_jensen I’m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth’s L-Five Lagrange point.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.
alex_jensen Is that true? Is he all right?
leonard_hofstadter No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity.
alex_jensen It’s okay, I’ve been around scientists all my life. My dad’s an astronomer at SETI.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.
alex_jensen So, what kind of research are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter High-energy lasers.
alex_jensen Ooh. Military?
leonard_hofstadter Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
amy_farrah_fowler You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank’s your problem, not mine.
alex_jensen You’re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Cherry stem! Cherry stem!
bernadette_rostenkowski How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?
howard_wolowitz Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
howard_wolowitz Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I’ll leave the door unlocked.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety.
howard_wolowitz No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home.
amy_farrah_fowler Look at you, putting on a brave face.
penny There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Really? I don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.
penny Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.
amy_farrah_fowler So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he’s desirable.
penny Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.
amy_farrah_fowler So it does bother you.
penny Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.
amy_farrah_fowler And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.
penny So, how was work today?
leonard_hofstadter Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.
penny Oh! You’re kidding.
leonard_hofstadter No, Raj had to go to the nurse.
penny Wow. Anything else?
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
penny Oh, is that it?
leonard_hofstadter Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
sheldon_cooper Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.
leonard_hofstadter What do you got?
sheldon_cooper I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
sheldon_cooper The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
alex_jensen Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
penny Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny.
alex_jensen Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
penny In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
alex_jensen Oh. Well, you’re lucky. He seems very talented. And I’m sure a lot of people want to work with him.
penny Well, a lot of people can’t. Uh, hey.
leonard_hofstadter Where are we going?
penny My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
alex_jensen She seems nice.
sheldon_cooper Notice people on your own time. We’re working.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Howie, how you feeling?
howard_wolowitz Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, stop that. NASA’s watching this! Put your pants back on!
howard_wolowitz Whee! Whee!
