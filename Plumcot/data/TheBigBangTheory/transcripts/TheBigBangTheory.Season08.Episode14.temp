penny So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?
leonard Wow, you remember that?
penny Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.
leonard You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.
penny And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?
leonard Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.
penny Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.
leonard Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?
penny No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.
leonard Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…
penny Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.
leonard No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.
penny Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.
leonard Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
sheldon Hmm.
leonard What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
sheldon Hmm.
leonard I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?
sheldon Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers.
leonard No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?
sheldon It’s good.
leonard Really?
sheldon I like it. I think you’re on to something.
leonard You do? You’re not messing with me?
sheldon Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.
leonard You’re giving me a sticker?
sheldon Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
leonard I’m not a preschooler.
sheldon Fine, I’ll take it back.
leonard I earned this. Back off.
leonard You’re still awake?
sheldon For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
leonard You worked out all the math.
sheldon Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.
leonard You wrote a paper on my idea?
sheldon I wrote a paper on our idea.
leonard When did my idea become our idea?
sheldon When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
leonard This is good. Our idea is really good.
sheldon Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.
leonard You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.
sheldon Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you.
leonard Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?
sheldon We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.
leonard You’re sure it’s good?
sheldon My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
leonard Okay, partner, let’s do it.
sheldon Come on. Click the mouse with me.
leonard One, two three.
together Click.
leonard Well, we did it.
sheldon Yes, we did, my friend.
leonard Is your tongue blue?
sheldon I don’t want to talk about it.
bernadette Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?
amy Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
penny Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.
bernadette Search for it.
penny What, no, why?
bernadette ‘Cause it would be fun to watch.
penny It would be humiliating.
bernadette Well, now we have two reasons.
amy They have it.
bernadette Please, can we watch it?
amy Please?
penny Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible.
amy Have you even seen it?
penny No.
bernadette Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.
voice_on_tv Bananas, get your fresh bananas.
bernadette Ho-ho, it really didn’t.
leonard Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.
sheldon Does it smell like blueberries?
leonard No.
sheldon Then we’re probably okay.
howard Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.
leonard Really? What’d they say?
howard Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.
leonard Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.
sheldon Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
leonard Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?
sheldon I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.
howard How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?
raj Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
sheldon Read another one.
leonard Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
sheldon Who wrote that?
leonard It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.
sheldon Well, I’m responding to it.
leonard Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level.
sheldon Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.
leonard Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this.
sheldon He just left another comment.
raj What does it say?
leonard Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.
sheldon Can I respond now?
leonard Do it.
sheldon You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.
leonard Somebody else do it.
penny Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.
doctor Why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?
penny Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.
penny Okay, we’ve seen plenty.
bernadette No, give me the remote.
amy Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.
penny Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.
amy What is it?
penny Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.
amy What?
bernadette Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.
amy I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.
bernadette Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.
penny You look like a talking cupcake.
bernadette And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.
amy Play it again. Play it again.
raj Did he respond yet?
sheldon Hmm. No, not yet.
leonard Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.
howard It wasn’t that bad.
leonard Read it back one more time.
sheldon My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.
leonard And you don’t think that’s too rough?
sheldon We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
penny How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
bernadette ‘Cause it’s embarrassing.
penny It is; it truly is.
bernadette Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.
penny No.
amy Why? What did I do?
bernadette Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.
penny Okay. We are reading that right now.
amy No, please don’t.
bernadette We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.
amy But it’s personal.
penny Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
amy No.
penny Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon.
amy It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.
penny Please show us?
bernadette Please?
amy No.
penny You know I’m gonna read it either way.
amy Good luck finding it.
penny Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.
bernadette Why? Why did it feel different?
penny Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.
amy You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that.
sheldon He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?
leonard Do you really want him to write back?
sheldon Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?
leonard Me-wow.
howard What are you doing?
raj I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.
howard This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
raj No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
sheldon He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?
howard Yes.
raj Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
sheldon Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating.
raj Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.
howard Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.
raj See? Better with the accent.
sheldon And send.
leonard What did you write?
sheldon I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.
leonard What does that mean?
sheldon I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.
leonard Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.
raj Come on, Sheldon!
sheldon Oh, okay, okay, calm down. It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.
leonard Oh, really?
penny “Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”
bernadette Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting.
amy He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking.
penny It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.
bernadette Here we go.
penny Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.
bernadette Oh, Amelia.
penny So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.
amy In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
raj I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
howard Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face.
sheldon Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
leonard Never noticed that about you.
raj You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.
sheldon He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.
leonard All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished.
sheldon Click it with me. One, two, three, click.
stephen_hawking Well, hello there.
sheldon Professor Hawking?
stephen_hawking Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.
leonard You really didn’t like our paper?
stephen_hawking I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.
sheldon Then why are you attacking us?
stephen_hawking If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you’d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.
leonard Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
sheldon Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
leonard And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.
howard How do you do, Mr. I’ll-Admit-That’s-Pretty-Cool?
raj Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.
penny With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.
bernadette Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
amy Okay, that’s enough.
penny What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.
amy You’re just making fun of me.
bernadette I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.
penny No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?
bernadette Please?
amy Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.
bernadette But they didn’t even kiss.
amy She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.
penny Yes.
amy “What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…
leonard You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
penny Get out!
bernadette Not now!
amelia Is the water warm enough?
cooper Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it’s a little nippy.
amelia I can fix that. I couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments.
cooper They’re not undergarments. They’re Underoos. Where I come from, they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear.
amelia And what’s the significance of the spider?
cooper Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.
amelia There’s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn’t there?
leonard You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought.
penny You want me to stop reading?
leonard Are you kidding? No, no.
penny As he stood for Amelia to dry him…
amelia So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?
leonard Yeah, okay, I’m good.
