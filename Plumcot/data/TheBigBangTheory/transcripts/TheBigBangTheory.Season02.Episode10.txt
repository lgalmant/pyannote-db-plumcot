dr_stephanie_barnett I don’t see anything at all, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
leonard_hofstadter Me, too.
sheldon_cooper Is it a high-frequency whistle?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.
dr_stephanie_barnett Yup, there’s no inflammation at all, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Then it must be a tumour.
dr_stephanie_barnett I Seriously doubt it.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
sheldon_cooper Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
dr_stephanie_barnett Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there’s something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I’m going to bed
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll be right in.
sheldon_cooper It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
leonard_hofstadter Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
sheldon_cooper How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting.
leonard_hofstadter No, you’re not.
sheldon_cooper Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
leonard_hofstadter That’s absurd.
sheldon_cooper You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
sheldon_cooper Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going to bed.
sheldon_cooper At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.
leonard_hofstadter No, absolutely not.
sheldon_cooper It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
dr_stephanie_barnett Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
leonard_hofstadter Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that.
sheldon_cooper I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
dr_stephanie_barnett He did very nicely.
sheldon_cooper See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
penny Out of coffee. Need coffee.
dr_stephanie_barnett Uh, hello.
penny Hi! Stephanie, right?
dr_stephanie_barnett Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?
penny I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you.
dr_stephanie_barnett Really?
penny Mm-hmm.
dr_stephanie_barnett I haven’t heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven’t I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?
leonard_hofstadter She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!
sheldon_cooper In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
sheldon_cooper Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
leonard_hofstadter She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…
dr_stephanie_barnett Well, it was very nice meeting you.
penny Nice to finally meet you, too.
dr_stephanie_barnett And I’ll see you tonight?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, bye-bye.
dr_stephanie_barnett Bye.
sheldon_cooper What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
penny So, that’s Stephanie, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
penny You know, she seems very nice.
sheldon_cooper Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate.
penny Roommate? You guys are living together?
sheldon_cooper Like hippies.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
sheldon_cooper Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
penny Are you sure?
leonard_hofstadter How could I not be sure?
penny Well, let’s find out.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
penny Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it. Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
penny Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?
leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
penny Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!
penny You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
penny You have a Bat Signal?
leonard_hofstadter I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together.
penny Really? What was your first clue?
howard_wolowitz New pants?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
howard_wolowitz Nice. Cotton?
leonard_hofstadter Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend.
howard_wolowitz So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.
leonard_hofstadter It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
howard_wolowitz Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.
leonard_hofstadter At least I have an egg. What do you have?
howard_wolowitz A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can’t.
leonard_hofstadter So, go hit on her.
howard_wolowitz She’s not my type.
raj_koothrappali Too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before.
howard_wolowitz She was?
raj_koothrappali Of course not. Look at her.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.
dr_stephanie_barnett Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
dr_stephanie_barnett Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
sheldon_cooper My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
dr_stephanie_barnett Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
dr_stephanie_barnett I’m kinda busy here, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
dr_stephanie_barnett A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
sheldon_cooper Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.
dr_stephanie_barnett Go home, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
penny Oh hey.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
penny Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
leonard_hofstadter No, the pants that Stephanie got me.
penny Oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
penny Absolutely.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.
penny Are you guys having problems?
leonard_hofstadter No, everything’s fine.
penny Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great.
penny Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
penny Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.
leonard_hofstadter No that doesn’t sound right either.
penny Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.
penny Sure.
leonard_hofstadter You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
penny You’re kidding, right?
leonard_hofstadter No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?
penny Go! Wow.
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, no.
sheldon_cooper Wha??
dr_stephanie_barnett You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like it.
sheldon_cooper I knew it! What do I do?
dr_stephanie_barnett You’re going to need to stop talking immediately.
sheldon_cooper For how…
dr_stephanie_barnett Du-du-du-du! Immediately.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, hi, honey.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon. What’s going on?
dr_stephanie_barnett I just performed a Sheldonectomy.
leonard_hofstadter Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse.
dr_stephanie_barnett Gotcha.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, we need to talk.
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what that means.
dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, why don’t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
dr_stephanie_barnett And?
leonard_hofstadter It’s just a little scary.
dr_stephanie_barnett Well, yeah, but scary good, right?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?
dr_stephanie_barnett Uh-huh.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
dr_stephanie_barnett Of course honey why don’t you tell me what it is you’re feeling?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!
dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I’m feeling?
leonard_hofstadter What’s that? Really? Right now?
dr_stephanie_barnett Why not?
leonard_hofstadter I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?
dr_stephanie_barnett I think that’s for swimming.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps.
dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Your pants are ruined.
leonard_hofstadter Good.
penny So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
leonard_hofstadter Well, um, on one level, really, really well.
penny So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
leonard_hofstadter Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
penny Good, good. And then what?
leonard_hofstadter And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
penny You had sex, didn’t you?
leonard_hofstadter Um, little bit. What?
penny Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another.
penny Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
penny Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.
leonard_hofstadter Huh.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me.
penny Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be.
leonard_hofstadter Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?
penny I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
leonard_hofstadter I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
penny Yeah, that’ll slow it down.
dr_stephanie_barnett I’m sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you.
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, God, here comes the speech.
leonard_hofstadter What speech?
dr_stephanie_barnett I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause I need my space but I’ll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don’t call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you’ve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you’re lying, but I pretend like I don’t care even though I’m dying inside!
leonard_hofstadter No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.
dr_stephanie_barnett Oh. Oh, good! ‘Cause I really like you, too.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hey. Nice sweater.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun.
raj_koothrappali It’s got a big bird on it, dude.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
raj_koothrappali You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around.
howard_wolowitz You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?
leonard_hofstadter Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible.
raj_koothrappali It’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
leonard_hofstadter Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
howard_wolowitz Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again. I was wrong. See ya.
penny Sheldon?
computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 I have an inflamed larynx.
penny Okay?
computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 We’re out of herbal tea. Do you have any?
penny Okay, let me check.
computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 Some hiney would be nice, too.
penny Hiney?
computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 Honey.
