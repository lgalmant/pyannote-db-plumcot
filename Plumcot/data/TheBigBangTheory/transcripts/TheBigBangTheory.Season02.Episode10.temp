steph I don’t see anything at all, Sheldon.
sheldon Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
leonard Me, too.
sheldon Is it a high-frequency whistle?
leonard No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.
steph Yup, there’s no inflammation at all, Sheldon.
sheldon Then it must be a tumour.
steph I Seriously doubt it.
leonard Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
sheldon Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
steph Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there’s something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I’m going to bed
leonard Okay, I’ll be right in.
sheldon It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
leonard Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
sheldon How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
leonard Good night.
sheldon Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting.
leonard No, you’re not.
sheldon Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.
leonard We’re not living together.
leonard That’s absurd.
sheldon You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
leonard Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
sheldon Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that.
leonard I’m going to bed.
sheldon At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.
leonard No, absolutely not.
sheldon It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
leonard I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
steph Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
leonard Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that.
sheldon I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
steph He did very nicely.
sheldon See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
penny Out of coffee. Need coffee.
steph Uh, hello.
penny Hi! Stephanie, right?
steph Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?
penny I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you.
steph Really?
penny Mm-hmm.
steph I haven’t heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven’t I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?
leonard She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!
sheldon In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying.
leonard Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon You’re welcome, Leonard.
leonard Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
sheldon Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
leonard She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…
steph Well, it was very nice meeting you.
penny Nice to finally meet you, too.
steph And I’ll see you tonight?
leonard Okay, bye-bye.
steph Bye.
sheldon What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
penny So, that’s Stephanie, huh?
leonard Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
penny You know, she seems very nice.
sheldon Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate.
penny Roommate? You guys are living together?
sheldon Like hippies.
leonard We’re not living together.
sheldon Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
leonard We’re not living together.
penny Are you sure?
leonard How could I not be sure?
penny Well, let’s find out.
leonard Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
penny Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it. Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
leonard We’re not living together.
penny Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?
leonard We’re not living together.
penny Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
leonard Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!
penny You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.
leonard We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
penny You have a Bat Signal?
leonard I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together.
penny Really? What was your first clue?
howard New pants?
leonard Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
howard Nice. Cotton?
leonard Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend.
howard So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.
leonard It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
howard Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.
leonard At least I have an egg. What do you have?
howard A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can’t.
leonard So, go hit on her.
howard She’s not my type.
raj Too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before.
howard She was?
raj Of course not. Look at her.
leonard I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.
steph Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
steph Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
sheldon My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
steph Thank you.
sheldon Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
steph I’m kinda busy here, Sheldon.
sheldon I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
steph A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
sheldon Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.
steph Go home, Sheldon.
sheldon Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
penny Oh hey.
leonard Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
penny Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
leonard No, the pants that Stephanie got me.
penny Oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined.
leonard Are you sure?
penny Absolutely.
leonard Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.
penny Are you guys having problems?
leonard No, everything’s fine.
penny Really?
leonard Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great.
penny Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something.
leonard Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
penny Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.
leonard No that doesn’t sound right either.
penny Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
leonard Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.
penny Sure.
leonard You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
penny You’re kidding, right?
leonard No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?
penny Go! Wow.
steph Oh, no.
sheldon Wha??
steph You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like it.
sheldon I knew it! What do I do?
steph You’re going to need to stop talking immediately.
sheldon For how…
steph Du-du-du-du! Immediately.
leonard Hey.
steph Oh, hi, honey.
leonard Sheldon. What’s going on?
steph I just performed a Sheldonectomy.
leonard Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse.
steph Gotcha.
leonard Listen, we need to talk.
steph Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”?
leonard I don’t know what that means.
steph Okay, why don’t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?
leonard Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
steph And?
leonard It’s just a little scary.
steph Well, yeah, but scary good, right?
leonard Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?
steph Uh-huh.
leonard Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
steph Of course honey why don’t you tell me what it is you’re feeling?
leonard Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!
steph Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I’m feeling?
leonard What’s that? Really? Right now?
steph Why not?
leonard I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?
steph I think that’s for swimming.
leonard Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps.
steph Yeah.
leonard Hey.
penny Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
leonard Thank you.
penny Your pants are ruined.
leonard Good.
penny So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
leonard Well, um, on one level, really, really well.
penny So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
leonard Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
penny Good, good. And then what?
leonard And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
penny You had sex, didn’t you?
leonard Um, little bit. What?
penny Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.
leonard Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another.
penny Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
leonard Really?
penny Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.
leonard Huh.
penny What?
leonard Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me.
penny Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be.
leonard Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?
penny I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
leonard I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
penny Yeah, that’ll slow it down.
steph I’m sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?
leonard Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you.
steph Oh, God, here comes the speech.
leonard What speech?
steph I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause I need my space but I’ll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don’t call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you’ve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you’re lying, but I pretend like I don’t care even though I’m dying inside!
leonard No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.
steph Oh. Oh, good! ‘Cause I really like you, too.
leonard Terrific.
leonard Hey.
raj Hey.
howard Hey. Nice sweater.
leonard Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun.
raj It’s got a big bird on it, dude.
leonard Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
raj You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around.
howard You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?
leonard Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
howard Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible.
raj It’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
leonard Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
howard Good for you.
leonard Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again. I was wrong. See ya.
penny Sheldon?
computer_voice I have an inflamed larynx.
penny Okay?
computer_voice We’re out of herbal tea. Do you have any?
penny Okay, let me check.
computer_voice Some hiney would be nice, too.
penny Hiney?
computer_voice Honey.
