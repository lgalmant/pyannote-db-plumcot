sheldon Leonard, I’ve got terrible news.
leonard What’s going on?
sheldon Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.
leonard Just tell me.
sheldon A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
leonard Oh, well, that kind of stinks.
sheldon That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
leonard What are we going to do?
sheldon Perform the experiment immediately.
leonard I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.
sheldon A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
leonard That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
sheldon Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.
leonard Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
sheldon Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
leonard Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?
barry Sowwy, there’s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
sheldon But you won’t need much for that.
barry Twue, but if it’s successful, I’m having a pawty with bawwoons.
leonard Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?
barry Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Not a chance.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?
barry Hell no.
sheldon He could’ve softened the blow.
raj Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?
leonard We’d have to go to every Party City in California.
howard Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
raj Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
sheldon Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.
howard If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions.
leonard Who is he?
sheldon Where does he work?
leonard How does he get the helium?
sheldon How many questions are too many questions?
howard Maybe he’s not for you.
sheldon Four questions. There answer’s four.
bernadette Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.
penny Oh, good for him.
bernadette I thought so, too.
penny So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?
bernadette He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
penny Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.
bernadette I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.
penny Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.
stuart What’s up?
bernadette Can you show us that dating app?
stuart Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.
penny Wow. So how many girls have you met?
stuart Two. I probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero.
penny Well, so how does it work?
stuart Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down.
bernadette Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?
stuart First time it happens I will let you know.
leonard Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.
sheldon What’s he say?
leonard He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
sheldon Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?
leonard The man restocking the cereal shelves.
sheldon That’s right. And what did he do?
leonard He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
sheldon It’s like it was yesterday.
leonard Do you want liquid helium or not?
sheldon Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.
leonard Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.
sheldon Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.
leonard We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.
sheldon Was she helping him with his research?
leonard Sure. So, are we doing this?
sheldon Well, but where does he get the helium?
leonard Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?
sheldon Uh, but this is violating university code.
leonard A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.
sheldon Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in.
leonard Done.
sheldon I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
leonard Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.
sheldon Aren’t you just made of sugar.
amy I’m not sure how I feel about this.
penny Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.
bernadette Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.
stuart One of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.
penny Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute.
bernadette Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
penny And he’s sad about it.
howard Hey.
raj Hello.
penny Hey.
bernadette Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?
howard If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money.
raj What are you guys up to?
bernadette We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there.
raj Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.
howard What was wrong with that guy?
raj Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.
howard Hey, I want to try.
amy Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?
howard Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?
leonard That must be him.
sheldon Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.
leonard Hey.
man What’s up?
leonard Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…
sheldon I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
man Great. You got the cash?
leonard Uh, yeah, uh, right here.
sheldon Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?
leonard What ya doing, Skippy?
sheldon Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
man Oh, how do I know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me?
sheldon Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
leonard Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists.
sheldon Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.
man Yeah, well, from my perspective, that’s how you two appear to me.
sheldon Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?
leonard My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
man Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate.
sheldon Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.
man Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.
leonard I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
man Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
sheldon Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.
man Hmm, I don’t follow.
sheldon Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.
man Is that a threat?
sheldon Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it.
man Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I’ll report you, then I’ll pound your asses into the ground.
sheldon Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?
leonard Afraid so, Skippy.
sheldon I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
leonard All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.
man No, I don’t like this. I’m out.
leonard No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.
man Really? What’s the hypothesis?
sheldon Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
man Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.
leonard Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.
sheldon And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.
leonard Here’s the money. Can we do this?
man Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.
leonard It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.
man Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there’s, uh, plenty we could do about it.
sheldon Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?
penny Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?
raj You know he won’t be looking at other girls.
howard Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.
penny Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.
bernadette Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.
penny Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.
howard I love you, Amy.
amy Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?
raj That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
penny Look, it’s Stuart.
raj You may want to leave the room.
sheldon Right this way, Uncle Harvey.
leonard Will you stop with that already?
sheldon I’m trying not to attract attention.
leonard And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
sheldon She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
leonard Let’s just start the experiment.
sheldon Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.
leonard We’re not getting caught.
sheldon Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?
leonard The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.
sheldon Uh-oh.
leonard What?
sheldon Well, did you see this sticker?
leonard What is it?
sheldon It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.
leonard It’s probably USC or UCLA.
sheldon Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.
leonard Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
sheldon That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.
leonard Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.
leonard Ma’am.
penny Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull.
raj I have that same underwear.
penny Chug.
penny Amy, you’re getting a text.
amy Oh, um, give me that.
raj I had a great time last night.
amy No, no, stop reading that.
howard Who’s Dave?
penny You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
amy No, it, it’s not like that.
bernadette And I’d love to take you out again”?
all Amy/What?/Can’t believe it/Oh, my God.
amy Okay, it’s like that.
leonard Thank you for coming back.
man Yeah, well, normally I wouldn’t, but my daughter’s having a sleepover, and there’s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.
sheldon Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.
man Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?
leonard No, nothing. We just changed our mind.
sheldon He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.
man Yeah, I hear you. Well, you’re good guys, so I’ll, uh, I’ll take the helium off your hands.
leonard Thank you.
man But you ain’t getting your money back.
sheldon You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
man Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.
leonard You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
man No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.
sheldon I don’t understand.
leonard He wants more money.
sheldon Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.
man That’s exactly how much it is.
sheldon Finally, something breaks our way.
penny I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
bernadette Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?
amy Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.
stuart A few people?
bernadette What?
penny Amy.
stuart So, are we allowed to ask how it’s going?
amy It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
raj What? I thought we were all… never mind.
bernadette I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people.
amy Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.
penny Well, good for you.
amy Thank you.
bernadette And how many guys have you gone out with?
stuart Please be less than two.
amy Three.
stuart Damn it.
sheldon Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.
leonard Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
sheldon It scared me straight, Leonard.
barry Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.
leonard Thank you, Barry.
barry But you have to add my name to your paper.
sheldon That’s preposterous.
barry I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me.
leonard Can you give us a minute?
barry Take your time. I’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.
sheldon I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
leonard Me neither, but what other choice do we have?
leonard I promise this is the last time.
leonard It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
sheldon How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
helium_man They should’ve used among, right?
sheldon Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.
helium_man All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?
sheldon Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
helium_man I am open to change.
