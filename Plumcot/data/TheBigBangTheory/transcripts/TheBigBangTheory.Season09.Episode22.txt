penny Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.
leonard_hofstadter That sounds fun.
penny Mm-hmm.
leonard_hofstadter How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
howard_wolowitz ‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.
sheldon_cooper Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.
amy_farrah_fowler But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
sheldon_cooper I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember.
penny All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.
raj_koothrappali I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
sheldon_cooper Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now.
sheldon_cooper I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
amy_farrah_fowler And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
penny The little choo-choo for toddlers?
amy_farrah_fowler And now you know why I needed the massage.
howard_wolowitz Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay, you should go.
howard_wolowitz You sure?
bernadette_rostenkowski Of course.
penny Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
sheldon_cooper Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me? How? Why?
sheldon_cooper Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.
bernadette_rostenkowski Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to.
leonard_hofstadter The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess we could give it a try.
sheldon_cooper Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.
howard_wolowitz I bet you’d like a drink right now.
raj_koothrappali Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. I’d like to meet her.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
sheldon_cooper Oh, but I won’t be there.
raj_koothrappali Funny how that worked out.
leonard_hofstadter Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?
raj_koothrappali No, I’m still dating her.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?
raj_koothrappali They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions.
sheldon_cooper You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
leonard_hofstadter Who’s Frank and Alicia?
sheldon_cooper You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?
howard_wolowitz Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.
sheldon_cooper I am going to record this for posterity.
leonard_hofstadter All right, here goes nothing.
sheldon_cooper Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.
sheldon_cooper Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.
raj_koothrappali It’s, it’s beautiful.
howard_wolowitz Actually, it’s making me dizzy.
leonard_hofstadter Good, it’s not just me.
claire Hello.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Claire.
claire Hey, what’s up?
raj_koothrappali Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
claire Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step.
raj_koothrappali Why would it be too big a step?
claire I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird.
raj_koothrappali Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
claire Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?
raj_koothrappali Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.
penny Hey, you ready to go?
leonard_hofstadter Hang on.
penny What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.
penny You actually smell the wine?
leonard_hofstadter I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
penny Are your sinuses acting up?
leonard_hofstadter Since my preschool got a bunny.
penny Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
penny Oh, good for you.
sheldon_cooper Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
penny No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, have fun.
sheldon_cooper Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.
leonard_hofstadter We’re leaving now!
sheldon_cooper Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.
penny Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.
sheldon_cooper Boy, do I love restrictions.
howard_wolowitz Hey. Where is everybody?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, we’re the first ones here.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Cool.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. Cool.
howard_wolowitz You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I do. It was three years ago.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.
amy_farrah_fowler So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.
howard_wolowitz I know. What are they gonna talk about?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. I really don’t know.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Oh, good.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, thank God.
penny You guys been here long?
howard_wolowitz No, two minutes.
amy_farrah_fowler But yes.
howard_wolowitz Where’s Claire?
raj_koothrappali Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma.
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?
penny Oh, yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you gonna say hi to him?
penny Uh, I don’t know.
raj_koothrappali Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.
bernadette_rostenkowski I brought sparkling cider.
sheldon_cooper Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.
bernadette_rostenkowski So what do you want to do tonight?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s more than one?
sheldon_cooper You’ve heard of French toast?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Cinnamon toast?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Melba toast?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
sheldon_cooper You get where I’m going here?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m getting an earthy note.
penny Ah, there’s definitely some oak.
raj_koothrappali Also, uh, cherries?
leonard_hofstadter I smell nothing.
howard_wolowitz Really? Nothing?
leonard_hofstadter Just a whole lot of Afrin.
zack_johnson Penny?
penny Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, hey, buddy.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
zack_johnson Hey, did you two get married?
penny We did.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, mm-hmm.
zack_johnson To each other?
penny Yes.
zack_johnson Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
zack_johnson So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?
howard_wolowitz We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
leonard_hofstadter But we won’t bore you with the details.
zack_johnson Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.
amy_farrah_fowler Mike deGrasse Tyson?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.
zack_johnson So what’s your invention?
howard_wolowitz Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.
leonard_hofstadter What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
zack_johnson Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.
howard_wolowitz You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever.
zack_johnson Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.
leonard_hofstadter And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
zack_johnson Is it better than the one they use now?
howard_wolowitz A lot.
leonard_hofstadter Way better.
zack_johnson Huh. You sure you guys are smart?
sheldon_cooper H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry, I have to ask.
sheldon_cooper When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.
bernadette_rostenkowski What is it about trains that you like so much?
sheldon_cooper What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s lovely, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.
leonard_hofstadter I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.
howard_wolowitz Me, too.
leonard_hofstadter Why didn’t you say something?
howard_wolowitz Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.
raj_koothrappali You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
penny E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.
amy_farrah_fowler How do you know that?
penny Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.
claire Hey, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.
leonard_hofstadter Would you like a glass of wine?
raj_koothrappali I said no questions.
sheldon_cooper And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.
bernadette_rostenkowski Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
sheldon_cooper You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, but just for a little bit.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right.
sheldon_cooper Ready?
bernadette_rostenkowski You bet.
sheldon_cooper Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
sheldon_cooper I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is getting fun. What’s next?
sheldon_cooper You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.
sheldon_cooper What do you do?
bernadette_rostenkowski I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.
sheldon_cooper He wants to see I.D.
amy_farrah_fowler So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you.
claire Really? Like what?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them.
zack_johnson Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.
raj_koothrappali Zack, this is my friend Claire.
zack_johnson You’re hot. You seeing anybody?
raj_koothrappali Uh, she’s seeing me.
zack_johnson Why’d you say she’s your friend?
raj_koothrappali We’re just keeping it casual.
zack_johnson Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.
claire I don’t know. Ask him.
zack_johnson Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should take a step back.
howard_wolowitz Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.
leonard_hofstadter No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.
howard_wolowitz But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.
leonard_hofstadter What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
howard_wolowitz Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.
leonard_hofstadter How?
howard_wolowitz Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
leonard_hofstadter Very funny.
howard_wolowitz You got something better?
leonard_hofstadter Well, not really.
howard_wolowitz Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?
leonard_hofstadter Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.
sheldon_cooper The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?
bernadette_rostenkowski Does it have eyes?
sheldon_cooper Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.
bernadette_rostenkowski I stab it in the middle eye.
sheldon_cooper Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
sheldon_cooper Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.
sheldon_cooper Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.
sheldon_cooper I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, thanks again.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.
bernadette_rostenkowski I might just take you up on that.
sheldon_cooper Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.
raj_koothrappali Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire.
zack_johnson What are you talking about?
raj_koothrappali I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me.
zack_johnson Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
zack_johnson Anything for you, my little foreign friend.
claire So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?
penny Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
zack_johnson I see what you’re saying. She’s not so great.
raj_koothrappali Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.
zack_johnson Polo.
raj_koothrappali So, uh, what are you guys talking about?
claire Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating.
raj_koothrappali Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
penny We didn’t.
amy_farrah_fowler You just did.
zack_johnson Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
sheldon_cooper Morning.
leonard_hofstadter Ugh. Too much wine.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?
sheldon_cooper Of course.
leonard_hofstadter Does it bother you?
sheldon_cooper No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.
leonard_hofstadter Who are these people?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.
