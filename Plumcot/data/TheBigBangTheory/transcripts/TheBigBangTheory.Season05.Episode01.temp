sheldon It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.
leonard What are you grinding about?
sheldon Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like.
leonard Just let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we? Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend.
leonard They slept together, Sherlock.
sheldon No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like.
leonard She lied.
sheldon Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?
howard Hey.
raj Hey.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?
leonard No, I’m fine with it.
sheldon That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.
leonard What the hell is wrong with you?
howard Yeah, how could you do that?
raj What is it to you?
howard I got his back.
raj Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard.
howard Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.
leonard Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.
raj Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.
leonard_and_howard_together What?
sheldon Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me.
howard You’re not in love with Penny.
raj Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.
howard Who?
raj He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.
leonard Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.
howard I’m sorry. What?
raj Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.
leonard Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
raj That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
sheldon For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing.
penny Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.
amy Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.
penny You heard what I did?
amy Well, I heard who you did.
penny Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.
amy Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?
penny No.
amy She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.
penny I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?
amy She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.
bernadette You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!
raj Please, come in.
bernadette What the hell is wrong with you?
raj Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.
bernadette I’m nice to everyone.
raj I’m sorry.
bernadette Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us.
raj I will. Hey, Bernadette?
bernadette What?!
raj Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
bernadette Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
penny You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.
amy You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.
penny You know what? Let’s get out of here.
amy Where are we going?
penny Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.
sheldon Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?
penny Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
amy Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.
penny Yeah, sure. Yay!
amy We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op.
penny Sounds great.
amy Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.
penny Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag.
amy No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.
leonard Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
sheldon Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you.
leonard I’m not in the mood, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help.
leonard I don’t want to talk to Amy.
sheldon No, it’s not Amy.
dr_hofstadter Hello, dear.
leonard You called my mother?
sheldon Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?
dr_hofstadter He’s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.
leonard What’s going on? What do you want?
dr_hofstadter Sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I’m here to help.
leonard That’s so nice.
dr_hofstadter And we’re back to the obvious. Now, what’s up?
leonard Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone.
dr_hofstadter I understand.
leonard Got any advice?
dr_hofstadter Yes. Buck up.
leonard Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?
dr_hofstadter Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.
leonard Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.
dr_hofstadter If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.
amy Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.
penny You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.
amy Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.
penny I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.
amy No, I can’t let you do that.
penny Why not?
amy For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.
raj Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?
amy A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
penny How did you know I was here?
raj It’s all over her Facebook page.
amy I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
penny Thanks.
amy No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?
penny So, hi. What’s up?
raj I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.
penny Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…
raj Aw, there’s a thing.
penny Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships.
raj You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
penny Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.
raj Oh. All right.
penny Thank you.
raj Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense.
penny Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?
raj No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.
penny Oh, you did, didn’t you?
raj Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.
penny So, we didn’t actually…
raj I did. It was beautiful.
penny Oh!
raj Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this.
penny Of course I won’t. No, I won’t.
raj Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?
penny Sure.
raj Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?
penny No.
raj Can I say I ruined you for white men?
penny Also no.
raj Okay, just the candle thing.
penny Yeah.
raj Cool. All right friend.
penny Hmm.
raj I’ll see you around.
penny Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend.
raj Penny?
penny Mm-hmm?
raj It’s getting beautiful again.
sheldon All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.
howard I don’t see anything.
sheldon Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out.
leonard Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
howard Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
raj Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
leonard You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?
howard Fine with me.
raj Sure, whatever.
sheldon You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.
leonard Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games.
sheldon This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?
leonard Yes, no and no.
sheldon Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.
howard Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.
sheldon No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. Geology isn’t a real science!
howard Damn those sons of bitches!
leonard Let’s get ’em!
sheldon If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!
leonard I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.
howard_and_raj Here, here.
sheldon Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal.
penny Hi. You guys have a minute?
leonard Uh, yeah, sure.
penny Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.
raj Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower.
penny Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?
raj Sorry. Go on.
penny Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska.
leonard You’re leaving?
penny Yeah.
howard What are you going to do in Nebraska?
penny I don’t know, maybe teach acting. Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?
leonard Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman.
penny Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
sheldon What about Nebraska?
penny Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!
sheldon Have you ever thought of teaching physics?
actress Ready to ride?
penny I don’t think so, Mom. Not today.
actress Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?
penny You don’t know the half of it.
actress Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.
penny Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
actress Now, the H is for Her.
leonard I’m proud of you.
penny Shh! Here comes my joke.
actress How are you doing?
penny Sittin’ pretty.
