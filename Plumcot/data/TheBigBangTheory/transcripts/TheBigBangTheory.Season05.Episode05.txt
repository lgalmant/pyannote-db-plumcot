leonard_hofstadter It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?
leonard_hofstadter What did you have in mind?
sheldon_cooper Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.
leonard_hofstadter It would be a replica of a movie prop.
sheldon_cooper Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
leonard_hofstadter Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
sheldon_cooper Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
leonard_hofstadter Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
sheldon_cooper Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it.
stuart_bloom Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.
sheldon_cooper Okay? It’s magnificent.
leonard_hofstadter Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
stuart_bloom Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s pretty steep.
stuart_bloom Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
sheldon_cooper Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Can you do any better?
stuart_bloom Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount.
sheldon_cooper Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.
leonard_hofstadter Slow down. Two hundred.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
leonard_hofstadter Will you shut up?
stuart_bloom Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five.
leonard_hofstadter Nope. Maybe another time.
stuart_bloom Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.
sheldon_cooper Take it, take it.
leonard_hofstadter Two hundred.
stuart_bloom Man, you’re killing me!
sheldon_cooper Killing you? I can’t breathe.
stuart_bloom Two ten, and I’m losing money.
sheldon_cooper Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
stuart_bloom Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr.
leonard_hofstadter So?
stuart_bloom Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.
stuart_bloom Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
leonard_hofstadter See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
sheldon_cooper I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.
stuart_bloom You want me to wrap it?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.
wil_wheaton Hey, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Ah, hey, Wil.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Wil Wheaton.
wil_wheaton Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
sheldon_cooper It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
wil_wheaton No.
sheldon_cooper I’m not surprised.
stuart_bloom Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
wil_wheaton Awesome. What do I owe you?
stuart_bloom Forty bucks.
wil_wheaton Good deal.
sheldon_cooper Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
wil_wheaton Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.
stuart_bloom Will there be girls there?
wil_wheaton Yeah, of course.
stuart_bloom ‘Cause there wasn’t last time.
wil_wheaton There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
wil_wheaton All right, great. Later.
sheldon_cooper I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.
leonard_hofstadter I was actually thinking about going.
sheldon_cooper And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.
leonard_hofstadter No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.
stuart_bloom Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
sheldon_cooper Possibly.
leonard_hofstadter Can you or can’t you?
sheldon_cooper It’s not that simple, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter It never is, is it?
sheldon_cooper At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.
leonard_hofstadter Got it. Can I have my water?
sheldon_cooper Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
penny Wait, what is going on?
sheldon_cooper In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…
penny No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
amy_farrah_fowler Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?
howard_wolowitz Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.
all@ Wow.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!
howard_wolowitz It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.
sheldon_cooper Mohammed Lee.
howard_wolowitz Who’s Mohammed Lee?
sheldon_cooper Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
howard_wolowitz It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut.
all@ Wow, that’s amazing!
bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
howard_wolowitz Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are those Russian rockets safe?
howard_wolowitz Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.
leonard_hofstadter I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you.
all@ Cheers.
sheldon_cooper That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.
howard_wolowitz You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. Just a little tired.
howard_wolowitz I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.
bernadette_rostenkowski I always catch your drift.
howard_wolowitz All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?
bernadette_rostenkowski I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just stop talking, Howard.
howard_wolowitz This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
bernadette_rostenkowski What did you think was going to happen?
howard_wolowitz Honestly? Sex.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
howard_wolowitz Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
howard_wolowitz I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.
howard_wolowitz Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
howard_wolowitz No?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
howard_wolowitz Well why not?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you.
howard_wolowitz Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!
leonard_hofstadter Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
sheldon_cooper Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.
leonard_hofstadter For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
sheldon_cooper Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?
leonard_hofstadter You never stop talking, do you?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?
penny Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
amy_farrah_fowler Mortal enemy?
penny Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?
sheldon_cooper In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?
penny Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
sheldon_cooper You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
amy_farrah_fowler A floppy disk?
sheldon_cooper Well, I started the list when I was nine.
amy_farrah_fowler How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
all@ Oh! Oh, God!
sheldon_cooper As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard?
howard_wolowitz Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love you.
howard_wolowitz I love you, too. So, sex now?
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back.
debbie_wolowitz Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m ready.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?
howard_wolowitz What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
raj_koothrappali Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
howard_wolowitz Little bit.
leonard_hofstadter I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.
leonard_hofstadter Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
sheldon_cooper Not yet.
raj_koothrappali So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions.
raj_koothrappali Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
howard_wolowitz Obviously.
bernadette_rostenkowski I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
amy_farrah_fowler You’re kidding.
penny No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.
penny Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
penny Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
penny Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
bernadette_rostenkowski I do, with all my heart.
penny Got it. Just had to check.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s great.
leonard_hofstadter All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.
sheldon_cooper No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.
leonard_hofstadter You want to drive?
raj_koothrappali Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.
leonard_hofstadter No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
sheldon_cooper Brent Spiner?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper I don’t care.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.
sheldon_cooper I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.
leonard_hofstadter I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, Bernadette’s here!
howard_wolowitz Tell her I’m not home!
debbie_wolowitz What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!
bernadette_rostenkowski Can we talk?
howard_wolowitz You can. I have nothing to say.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.
howard_wolowitz I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.
howard_wolowitz If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know.
howard_wolowitz Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.
bernadette_rostenkowski Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
howard_wolowitz Well, those big kids were rocking it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.
howard_wolowitz Really?
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
howard_wolowitz Right, right.
debbie_wolowitz Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!
raj_koothrappali Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Well, I just met her gynaecologist!
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home.
wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.
sheldon_cooper What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
wil_wheaton This is for you.
sheldon_cooper An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
wil_wheaton I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t show up.
wil_wheaton Look at what I wrote.
sheldon_cooper To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.
wil_wheaton It’s my last one. I want you to have it.
sheldon_cooper Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!
brent_spiner Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years. Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
sheldon_cooper Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.
brent#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 Sorry, Slim. I’ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?
sheldon_cooper You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.
wil_wheaton Don’t worry. It doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time.
sheldon_cooper Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.
leonard_hofstadter Can we get autographed dolls?
brent#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 Sure. Twenty bucks.
leonard_hofstadter Ten.
brent#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 Eighteen.
leonard_hofstadter Twelve.
brent#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 Sixteen.
leonard_hofstadter Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
brent#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 Done.
