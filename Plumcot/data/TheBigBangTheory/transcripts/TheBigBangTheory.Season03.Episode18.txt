raj_koothrappali Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so?
raj_koothrappali So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.
howard_wolowitz What’s your point?
raj_koothrappali My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very nervous around James Cameron.
sheldon_cooper It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science.
sheldon_cooper And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You.
sheldon_cooper I won?
leonard_hofstadter You won.
sheldon_cooper I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.
raj_koothrappali Well, good for him.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.
howard_wolowitz Didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
raj_koothrappali No.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.
howard_wolowitz Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.
sheldon_cooper Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. Problem.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
howard_wolowitz Well, no, you’re mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can’t do is shut up.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.
sheldon_cooper I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
leonard_hofstadter What, to you, is a large crowd?
sheldon_cooper Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
penny Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.
sheldon_cooper I’m not accepting the award.
penny Why not?
howard_wolowitz Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
penny That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Am I? Let me tell you a story.
howard_wolowitz Where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?
sheldon_cooper I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
penny I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
sheldon_cooper I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon_cooper Don’t trample me.
sheldon_cooper Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Sit down, we want to talk to you.
sheldon_cooper Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
penny Just sit.
leonard_hofstadter We think we can help you with your stage fright.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you.
penny Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant.
penny Okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by yourself.
leonard_hofstadter We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
sheldon_cooper I do like the X-Men.
penny Did I see X-Men?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.
penny Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?
penny Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.
sheldon_cooper That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
sheldon_cooper What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
leonard_hofstadter My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.
howard_wolowitz Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don’t know, some Indian meditation crap.
sheldon_cooper I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.
howard_wolowitz My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that’s 24-7, buddy.
sheldon_cooper And I appreciate the pretence.
penny So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?
sheldon_cooper No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s not a good name.
raj_koothrappali Okay, Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.
sheldon_cooper And yet, you can’t speak to women.
raj_koothrappali True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.
sheldon_cooper Okay, but don’t punch me.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me.
raj_koothrappali I’m not going to punch you.
sheldon_cooper That’s what my sister used to say.
raj_koothrappali Do you want to do this or not?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Proceed.
raj_koothrappali All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
sheldon_cooper Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.
raj_koothrappali Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis.
sheldon_cooper Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?
raj_koothrappali Whatever you like.
sheldon_cooper I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
raj_koothrappali Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.
sheldon_cooper Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
raj_koothrappali Then, put on a sweater.
sheldon_cooper Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.
sheldon_cooper You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.
raj_koothrappali You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
sheldon_cooper Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.
raj_koothrappali All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in Sheldon Square.
sheldon_cooper Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.
raj_koothrappali What now?
sheldon_cooper A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.
sheldon_cooper I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
penny It’ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I’m feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
sheldon_cooper Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
penny Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice.
sheldon_cooper It’s only one colour.
penny Yeah, so?
sheldon_cooper That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
penny Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.
penny No, you’re wrong.
sheldon_cooper This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. Okay, I think we have a winner.
penny Where the hell d’you find that?
sheldon_cooper In the prom department.
penny It’s ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
penny Please just try this one on.
sheldon_cooper Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. This is absurd. I look like a clown.
leonard_hofstadter So, Sheldon, how you doing?
sheldon_cooper That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, I’ll start again.
sheldon_cooper Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
leonard_hofstadter Um, I don’t know, maybe.
sheldon_cooper I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.
leonard_hofstadter How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
sheldon_cooper I was wearing size a million pants.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we just talk?
sheldon_cooper Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
leonard_hofstadter Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?
sheldon_cooper Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.
leonard_hofstadter But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.
sheldon_cooper And how did that make you feel?
leonard_hofstadter Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
sheldon_cooper Go on.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
sheldon_cooper So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother.
leonard_hofstadter Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter For what?
sheldon_cooper If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!
leonard_hofstadter Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of…
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear.
penny What’s the matter?
sheldon_cooper I’m getting dizzy.
raj_koothrappali Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.
sheldon_cooper I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
penny Here, drink this. It’ll relax you.
sheldon_cooper Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
penny Fine, faint.
sheldon_cooper I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective.
penny Here, see if this one works.
leonard_hofstadter First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.
sheldon_cooper I’m ready.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,
sheldon_cooper Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper Question one, where are my pants?
leonard_hofstadter You might want to check YouTube.
sheldon_cooper What do I search?
leonard_hofstadter It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
sheldon_cooper All right, people, let’s get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body’s in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-uh, give it a minute.
sheldon_cooper Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here’s Uranus.
