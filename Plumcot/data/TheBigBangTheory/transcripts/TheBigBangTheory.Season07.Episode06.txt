penny What are you working on?
sheldon_cooper Can’t talk. In the zone.
penny Do you know what he’s doing?
amy_farrah_fowler Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut.
penny Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s ready.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.
howard_wolowitz Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
raj_koothrappali Why is that great news?
bernadette_rostenkowski In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections, mo’ money.
howard_wolowitz Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already.
howard_wolowitz Guys, listen up.
sheldon_cooper Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care.
howard_wolowitz Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.
sheldon_cooper Really don’t care.
howard_wolowitz I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.
penny Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?
howard_wolowitz Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.
penny Ah.
howard_wolowitz Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.
leonard_hofstadter Aw.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I love that.
raj_koothrappali That is so beautiful.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
leonard_hofstadter It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.
penny Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?
leonard_hofstadter Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?
sheldon_cooper Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.
leonard_hofstadter And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?
penny I can name tons.
leonard_hofstadter Sex doesn’t count.
penny Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I took you there. All you did was…
penny I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.
leonard_hofstadter It’s fine. And also not true.
penny Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your freakin’ ass off.
leonard_hofstadter That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
penny Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Zone.
leonard_hofstadter He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.
leonard_hofstadter Nope, it was better before.
sheldon_cooper Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.
leonard_hofstadter Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
sheldon_cooper Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, definitely better before.
howard_wolowitz So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?
leonard_hofstadter If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.
howard_wolowitz Great. Will you play the ukulele?
raj_koothrappali Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.
howard_wolowitz Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.
raj_koothrappali Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks.
howard_wolowitz Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, that’s incredible.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.
howard_wolowitz So, what happens next?
sheldon_cooper Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been.
leonard_hofstadter Good to know.
sheldon_cooper Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.
penny Thank you so much for coming.
raj_koothrappali You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
penny Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this.
raj_koothrappali As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his…
penny Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count.
raj_koothrappali Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s heart is through his stomach.
penny I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?
raj_koothrappali Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.
penny Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s head.
raj_koothrappali Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.
penny That’s from Say Anything.
raj_koothrappali Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.
penny I get that, but why is this so hard?
raj_koothrappali Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.
penny Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.
sheldon_cooper Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker.
sheldon_cooper And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m so proud of you.
sheldon_cooper Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s next?
sheldon_cooper This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
amy_farrah_fowler And what?
sheldon_cooper No. No, no, no, no.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper I’ve made a horrible mistake.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?
amy_farrah_fowler That Americans can’t handle the metric system?
sheldon_cooper Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.
amy_farrah_fowler But the Chinese team found the element.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.
amy_farrah_fowler So you just got lucky?
sheldon_cooper Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
amy_farrah_fowler You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking.
sheldon_cooper What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist.
leonard_hofstadter You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.
sheldon_cooper There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you.
sheldon_cooper No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.
sheldon_cooper You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want to blow the surprise.
leonard_hofstadter We’ll be there.
raj_koothrappali Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.
howard_wolowitz E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.
raj_koothrappali Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.
leonard_hofstadter I will not.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please?
howard_wolowitz No, I want this to be romantic.
raj_koothrappali It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode06 There he is.
sheldon_cooper Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode06 Woo!
sheldon_cooper And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.
raj_koothrappali Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, they found the element. No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?
leonard_hofstadter Invite them to live with us.
penny Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
penny Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count.
howard_wolowitz I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call and check on her.
sheldon_cooper The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s a big deal.
sheldon_cooper I know. When will this nightmare end?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not.
sheldon_cooper You’re not?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you.
sheldon_cooper That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.
penny Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.
howard_wolowitz Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, is she okay?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine.
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler Poor Bernadette.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no.
sheldon_cooper I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.
howard_wolowitz You’re sure you’re okay?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.
howard_wolowitz Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s all this?
howard_wolowitz Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, get over here.
sheldon_cooper She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz If I didn’t have you, life would be blue, I’d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.
sheldon_cooper Is it me, or does she not look so good?
amy_farrah_fowler Shh.
howard_wolowitz A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom.
all@ And he’d probably still live with his mom.
howard_wolowitz Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Howie.
howard_wolowitz If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam.
all@ And he’d definitely still live with his mom.
howard_wolowitz Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.
all@ Oh, we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking.
sheldon_cooper She’s sick, I knew it. Bye.
leonard_hofstadter I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made.
penny I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.
leonard_hofstadter Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.
penny Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see why.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, rose petals.
penny Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
leonard_hofstadter You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.
penny Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wow.
penny It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.
leonard_hofstadter This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing. I love it.
penny No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
leonard_hofstadter It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.
penny Oh, my God, I am the worst.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.
penny No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
penny Of course I did. It’s you.
leonard_hofstadter Come here.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Is that a pregnancy test?
penny Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
amy_farrah_fowler Me? What did I do?
sheldon_cooper You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you.
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry.
sheldon_cooper Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
amy_farrah_fowler Can’t talk, in the zone.
