leonard_hofstadter Aaargh. What the hell?
sheldon_cooper Emergency preparedness drill.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, come on!
sheldon_cooper Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.
leonard_hofstadter I have to get a lock for my door.
sheldon_cooper I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?
leonard_hofstadter Fine.
sheldon_cooper All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
sheldon_cooper You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, what am I doing?
sheldon_cooper Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!
leonard_hofstadter Aah!
sheldon_cooper And that’s why we wear hard hats.
howard_wolowitz Check it out, press release from NASA.
raj_koothrappali Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
raj_koothrappali Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.
howard_wolowitz I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
raj_koothrappali Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.
howard_wolowitz Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
raj_koothrappali Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
leonard_hofstadter Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
howard_wolowitz Emergency drill night last night, huh?
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
raj_koothrappali How’d you do?
leonard_hofstadter You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
sheldon_cooper You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?
sheldon_cooper Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.
raj_koothrappali They put you under for a cleaning?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist.
sheldon_cooper Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”
leonard_hofstadter You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
sheldon_cooper Well, it has. Ask anybody.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care. I’m done.
sheldon_cooper Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.
sheldon_cooper Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. ‘Sup?
leonard_hofstadter Where do I sign?
sheldon_cooper Right here. Use your finger.
leonard_hofstadter There. Done.
sheldon_cooper All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna go home and take a nap.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.
howard_wolowitz I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
penny What does that mean?
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s gonna learn to poop in space.
howard_wolowitz Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
raj_koothrappali Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
sheldon_cooper Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter ‘Sup?
sheldon_cooper ‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.
amy_farrah_fowler I saved you a dumpling.
sheldon_cooper Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s.
sheldon_cooper You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?
penny Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
howard_wolowitz Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid.
sheldon_cooper Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?
raj_koothrappali Their meatballs are pretty good.
sheldon_cooper What’s that?
raj_koothrappali Nothing, nothing.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?
sheldon_cooper No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.
stuart_bloom Ninth?
sheldon_cooper You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
stuart_bloom Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
sheldon_cooper Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?
stuart_bloom Yeah.
sheldon_cooper And your father? Alive?
stuart_bloom Yes.
sheldon_cooper How about your grandparents, they alive?
stuart_bloom No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?
stuart_bloom I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.
stuart_bloom Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you to the dentist.
sheldon_cooper Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?
howard_wolowitz You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
raj_koothrappali Buzz Lightyear is not real.
howard_wolowitz No, that’s not what I’m talking about.
raj_koothrappali Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?
howard_wolowitz No.
raj_koothrappali Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.
raj_koothrappali All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?
leonard_hofstadter That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.
raj_koothrappali Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
howard_wolowitz Like how?
leonard_hofstadter Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.
howard_wolowitz Did it work?
leonard_hofstadter No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed.
howard_wolowitz That’s actually not a terrible plan.
raj_koothrappali They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
leonard_hofstadter ‘Sup?
sheldon_cooper ‘Sup?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
sheldon_cooper Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.
leonard_hofstadter All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.
sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
leonard_hofstadter Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.
sheldon_cooper I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.
penny Oh, good, your power’s out, too.
leonard_hofstadter Why is that good?
penny Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.
sheldon_cooper Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
leonard_hofstadter What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon.
sheldon_cooper And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
penny You know, I got some candles in my apartment.
sheldon_cooper But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.
leonard_hofstadter You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.
penny I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
sheldon_cooper Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind.
leonard_hofstadter To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
penny You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?
leonard_hofstadter I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.
penny Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
leonard_hofstadter I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
penny Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.
sheldon_cooper Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, what is it?
sheldon_cooper I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
leonard_hofstadter S’mores, huh? Good for you.
sheldon_cooper Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.
leonard_hofstadter No, thanks. I’m good.
sheldon_cooper Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.
penny Aw.
leonard_hofstadter No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.
penny But he’s sad.
leonard_hofstadter No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in.
penny I think he misses his little buddy.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you said candles were dangerous.
sheldon_cooper This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat. Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
sheldon_cooper What are you proposing?
leonard_hofstadter That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
sheldon_cooper And how would I do that?
leonard_hofstadter You say thank you.
sheldon_cooper Every time?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not crazy.
sheldon_cooper Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.
leonard_hofstadter I kind of like the sound of that.
sheldon_cooper Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else. Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
leonard_hofstadter So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Can I sit in your spot?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Can I control the thermostat?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Do I get a card?
sheldon_cooper Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.
penny Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.
leonard_hofstadter Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day.
penny Leonard’s Day?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good.
howard_wolowitz All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?
howard_wolowitz Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!
debbie_wolowitz Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.
howard_wolowitz Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.
nasa_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.
howard_wolowitz No problem, Dr. Massimino.
mike_massimino The guys here call me Mass.
howard_wolowitz Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
mass#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…
howard_wolowitz Sorry. My phone.
mass#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 What is that? Is that Rocket Man?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.
debbie_wolowitz Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!
howard_wolowitz Not now!
mass#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 Who’s that?
howard_wolowitz My mom. Sorry.
howard_wolowitz No problem, Fruit Loops.
