penny Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.
penny Do or do not. There is no try.
leonard_hofstadter Did you just quote Star Wars?
penny I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.
penny Oh. Oh. Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
penny Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad.
leonard_hofstadter Good. Glad is good.
penny Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Hmm.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, probably.
penny Okay, good night, sweetie.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?
raj_koothrappali Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.
sheldon_cooper You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
howard_wolowitz What’s with him?
sheldon_cooper Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
howard_wolowitz Are you saying he’s man-struating?
sheldon_cooper Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.
raj_koothrappali Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.
howard_wolowitz Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?
raj_koothrappali Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do.
sheldon_cooper Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
raj_koothrappali Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?
leonard_hofstadter I honestly don’t care.
raj_koothrappali Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.
leonard_hofstadter What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
howard_wolowitz Would that be a giant rat’s ass?
sheldon_cooper For the record, giant rats are possible.
leonard_hofstadter Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
howard_wolowitz Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.
sheldon_cooper Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
raj_koothrappali Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.
leonard_hofstadter No, there was no spat.
howard_wolowitz Oh, but something happened.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it.
sheldon_cooper But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
howard_wolowitz What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?
raj_koothrappali Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?
leonard_hofstadter What? No.
raj_koothrappali I’m just asking, dude. It happens.
stuart_bloom You guys still on for bowling tonight?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.
stuart_bloom Oh. Ouch.
sheldon_cooper That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
howard_wolowitz Did you ask her to start waxing?
leonard_hofstadter No.
raj_koothrappali Did you start waxing?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?
leonard_hofstadter I’m walking away from you now.
howard_wolowitz That wasn’t a no.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I think we’re getting close.
howard_wolowitz Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that would be a good way to go.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
sheldon_cooper Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock.
penny Oh, right, bowling.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
penny No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.
sheldon_cooper We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
penny It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
penny Thinly veiled contempt.
sheldon_cooper Remember, seven o’clock.
penny Got it.
sheldon_cooper Pacific Daylight time!
penny Bite me!
sheldon_cooper Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
howard_wolowitz I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
sheldon_cooper These are my own bowling shoes.
howard_wolowitz Then what’s with the disinfectant?
sheldon_cooper I know where my feet have been.
stuart_bloom Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.
wil_wheaton Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?
sheldon_cooper Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
wil_wheaton You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?
sheldon_cooper I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?
wil_wheaton It tells me that I am living rent-free right here . You ready to bowl?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.
wil_wheaton Great. Then it’s on.
sheldon_cooper Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.
wil_wheaton Yes!
sheldon_cooper A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan.
wil_wheaton Oh, thanks.
howard_wolowitz I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?
raj_koothrappali Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Chilli cheese fry?
penny Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
leonard_hofstadter Really? You love them?
penny Yeah, why?
leonard_hofstadter No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
penny Do you really want to get into this right now?
leonard_hofstadter Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
penny Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?
penny I’m not sure.
leonard_hofstadter How can you not be sure?
penny Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation.
leonard_hofstadter No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.
penny Don’t push it, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter I am not pushing anything.
penny You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!
raj_koothrappali Ah, the premature I love you.
howard_wolowitz I guessed premature. Does that count?
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper This is for you.
penny Ice cream?
sheldon_cooper I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.
penny Um, Ach.
sheldon_cooper If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
penny Did Leonard send you over here?
sheldon_cooper No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.
penny Yeah, I’m sorry about that.
sheldon_cooper I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
penny Again, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
penny You’re kidding.
sheldon_cooper No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
penny All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
sheldon_cooper The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
penny Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
sheldon_cooper You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.
penny No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you.
sheldon_cooper When are you going to talk to him?
penny I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
penny You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
penny I think we should talk now.
leonard_hofstadter What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.
penny Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?
leonard_hofstadter All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.
penny Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well.
leonard_hofstadter Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
penny I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I do.
penny So, we’re good?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great.
sheldon_cooper All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here.
sheldon_cooper Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.
penny The Wesley Crushers?
sheldon_cooper No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”
penny I don’t get it.
leonard_hofstadter Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
penny Still don’t get it.
sheldon_cooper It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.
penny Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.
sheldon_cooper What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
howard_wolowitz You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers.
sheldon_cooper Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
wil_wheaton Hey, look. They named their team after me.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not the… Never mind.
stuart_bloom So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
stuart_bloom Ouch again.
wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
wil_wheaton After you.
sheldon_cooper No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.
wil_wheaton It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.
sheldon_cooper All right.
wil_wheaton It’s a custom, not a rule.
sheldon_cooper I so loathe you.
wil_wheaton That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.
sheldon_cooper That’s not even from your franchise!
stuart_bloom I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.
penny Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know.
stuart_bloom Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now.
sheldon_cooper Be the ball, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Leave me alone, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You weren’t the ball.
penny Hey, thanks.
leonard_hofstadter This is fun, huh?
penny Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
penny Mm-hmm.
leonard_hofstadter Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.
penny Yeah, that’s right.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up.
all@ Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
all@ The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.
wil_wheaton I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.
penny Oh, yeah, me, too.
wil_wheaton It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it.
penny Tell me about it.
wil_wheaton I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.
penny Oh, I’m sorry.
wil_wheaton Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.
penny Really?
wil_wheaton Yeah, would have been kinder.
stuart_bloom Wil, you’re up.
wil_wheaton Oh, that’s me.
sheldon_cooper Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
penny What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
penny No!
sheldon_cooper Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.
wil_wheaton Yes!
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you’re up.
sheldon_cooper All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.
penny Yeah, I got it.
leonard_hofstadter We really need a strike here.
penny I know.
leonard_hofstadter So just take your time and concentrate.
penny Leonard, stop pressuring me.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not pressuring you.
penny Yeah, you are! Just back off!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.
penny I didn’t mean shut up.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
penny No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!
leonard_hofstadter No, let her go.
sheldon_cooper Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!
leonard_hofstadter I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
wil_wheaton Tough luck, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You did this, didn’t you?
wil_wheaton Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?
sheldon_cooper No, I suppose not.
wil_wheaton Good. Keep thinking that.
sheldon_cooper Wheaton!
stuart_bloom Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I’m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it’s time to collect.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered.
