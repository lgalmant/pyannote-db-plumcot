raj Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.
leonard We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
howard Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.
sheldon I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.
leonard That’s not what happened.
sheldon I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.
howard No one wants to hear it.
sheldon Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.
leonard Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.
sheldon Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?
raj Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
howard Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
raj Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
howard And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.
leonard I think someone owes me an apology.
sheldon Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.
howard You admit Amy’s a distraction?
sheldon Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?
leonard Well, maybe we have lost our focus.
howard It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
raj Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.
leonard Like our own science retreat.
howard My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
sheldon I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
leonard Then we’ll go to a hotel.
sheldon A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
raj We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
sheldon Did you see The Lake House?
raj Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
sheldon Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.
leonard Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.
sheldon Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house.
leonard You would go to a beach house?
sheldon Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?
penny Hey.
leonard Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.
penny Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
amy Of course I do.
penny Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?
bernadette Hell, yeah.
penny Yes. I’ll check flights.
bernadette I’ll check hotels.
amy I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.
leonard They seem okay with it.
raj Hey.
leonard Hey.
howard Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.
raj Why not?
howard Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.
raj For your information, Emily is working tonight.
sheldon Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.
leonard Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.
sheldon Thinking caps on.
howard Here we go.
raj Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.
howard Oh. I never saw that.
sheldon Really?
raj Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
sheldon Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.
raj Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.
leonard Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.
sheldon I’m sorry. Is that a no?
howard Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?
leonard I, I think I still have it.
sheldon I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.
leonard Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.
howard Mm, that was mine.
leonard Robot prostitute.
howard Also mine.
sheldon Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
howard There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.
raj Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.
leonard Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.
howard No, it vibrates. Keep going.
leonard You know, let’s just come up with something new.
sheldon You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.
raj Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.
leonard How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
sheldon If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.
leonard Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.
raj Oh, I have an idea.
sheldon I think I have the same one.
howard We got to watch Back to the Future II.
raj I’ll make the popcorn.
penny So, where should we go first?
amy Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.
penny Nah.
amy But they play Barry Manilow.
penny No.
amy But they’re called Fairly Manilow.
penny Oh. Okay.
amy Great.
penny No.
bernadette Well, what do you want to do?
penny Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.
amy What if we don’t want to vomit?
penny Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.
amy What?
penny It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
amy What does that mean?
penny It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.
bernadette That sucks.
amy Can you start in the morning?
penny Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.
bernadette You sure?
penny Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.
amy So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…
bernadette We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.
amy Okay.
howard Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.
leoanard This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
sheldon Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?
leonard What do you mean?
sheldon Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
leonard Had will have placed?
sheldon That’s my boy.
leonard Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.
sheldon Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!
howard What?
sheldon Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…
leonard Wait. Is brought right?
sheldon Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
leonard I don’t know. You did it to me.
sheldon Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.
raj He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.
howard Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.
leonard Guys.
sheldon Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?
raj Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
leonard Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.
sheldon I don’t think it worked.
amy Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow.
bernadette I think after this, I’ll be dead.
amy Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.
bernadette I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.
amy It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good.
bernadette We are.
amy Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’.
bernadette Amy.
amy Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?
bernadette You’re embarrassing me.
amy Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine.
bernadette What?
amy No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.
leonard All right.
sheldon Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.
raj Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.
leonard So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.
howard Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.
sheldon Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.
raj Go online and look it up.
howard Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.
raj That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.
leonard I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?
sheldon Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?
howard Like behavior modification?
sheldon Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?
raj That cannot be true.
raj Hey, it was match point.
leonard Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
raj Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
howard We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
sheldon Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.
leonard If only we had one.
sheldon Oh, I’ll check Amazon.
bernadette Housekeeping.
amy We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
bernadette It was us the whole time.
amy Why’d you tell her? It was working.
bernadette Was it working?
penny Yeah.
bernadette Oh, I’m so sorry.
penny You guys look like you’re having fun.
amy We’re having the best time.
bernadette Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
penny That’s a dollar.
bernadette Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
amy Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.
bernadette We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
penny That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
amy Can you believe this nerd?
bernadette Come on.
