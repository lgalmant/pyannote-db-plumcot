penny Helium.
sheldon Yes.
penny Yes.
sheldon Taylor Swift.
penny Yes. Pi.
sheldon Yes. Kardashian.
penny More specific.
sheldon Khloe?
penny Yes.
sheldon See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.
penny Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?
leonard What are you guys doing?
sheldon Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.
leonard Oh, let me try.
penny Okay.
leonard Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.
sheldon I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?
leonard Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?
penny Sure.
leonard Thanks.
penny No problem.
leonard Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?
sheldon Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
leonard Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.
sheldon She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
penny You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
leonard Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.
penny Or a way for you to avoid her?
leonard I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.
penny Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.
leonard Seriously?
penny Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship.
leonard That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
sheldon All right, back to learning.
penny Okay.
sheldon Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.
penny Or as I know him?
sheldon Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
penny Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
raj Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
sheldon Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.
leonard When’s the screening?
raj Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
howard Let’s do it.
leonard Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in.
sheldon Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.
leonard You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
howard In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?
raj Uh, I’d say by three.
sheldon You’re really going without me?
leonard It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you.
sheldon You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting.
leonard People do it all the time.
sheldon You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
howard If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.
stuart People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.
howard Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
stuart And now I feel worse again.
beverly I’m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He’s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?
penny Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?
beverly Dear, I’m a psychiatrist. You don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.
penny Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs.
beverly Very well. What’s the last book you read?
penny Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
beverly Penny, it’s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?
penny Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?
beverly And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?
penny Uncomfortable.
beverly That was a joke, dear.
penny Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
beverly So just the two of us?
penny Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.
stuart Hey.
amy What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon.
stuart I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.
amy Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?
stuart No, it’s not like that. There’s a long line he’d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.
amy We’re not going shopping together.
stuart You sure? I’m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.
amy Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?
stuart Look, lady, I just work here.
howard We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?
sheldon Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
raj Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
leonard Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
sheldon Stuart, what are you doing here?
stuart Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?
sheldon I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?
stuart Oh, I’m not upset with you, but Amy’s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
sheldon Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.
stuart You’re darn right it’s fair play, you selfish jerk.
amy You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?
beverly Maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise.
amy I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on.
beverly Oh, it’s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.
amy I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
beverly Well, I do admire your resolve. You’re an extraordinary woman.
amy Thank you.
penny You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?
bernadette Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t.
amy Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
beverly Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.
amy Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.
penny You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.
beverly Yes. Well, what can you do?
amy Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry.
stuart Sheldon says he’s sorry.
amy Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door.
stuart I would have done it for three.
raj Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.
howard Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
raj Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.
stuart Hey.
sheldon Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
stuart Uh, no, she’s still pretty mad.
sheldon Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
stuart I said, Sheldon says he’s sorry.
sheldon Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick.
leonard You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
sheldon I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot.
stuart I’m happy to hold your place till you get back.
sheldon You would do that?
stuart Consider it my way of getting more of your money.
sheldon You’re a good man.
bernadette So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?
beverly Oh, I didn’t realize you two work together.
bernadette Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team.
beverly Oh, what are you currently developing?
bernadette Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
beverly That’s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.
amy Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.
beverly It was.
bernadette Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?
penny Um, it has seat warmers.
sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
amy Come in.
sheldon Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.
amy Fine.
sheldon Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.
penny How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
beverly Since the airport, dear.
howard You look like you come with a kickstand.
raj You can’t make me feel bad.
howard Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?
leonard So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
sheldon I’m back.
leonard Hey, how’d it go?
sheldon It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.
stuart Anyone else need anything before I go?
howard I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.
stuart That’s mean.
howard Five.
stuart You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.
howard Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.
man Hey, guys.
woman You made it.
sheldon Did you see that? He just cut the line.
leonard He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
sheldon No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.
howard We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.
sheldon What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
leonard We’d still get in.
sheldon What if each of those people let someone cut?
leonard Still get in.
sheldon But then each of those people let someone cut?
leonard We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.
sheldon Excuse me.
leonard Oh, please don’t.
sheldon Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.
man Oh, uh, I’m with my friends. It’s cool.
sheldon Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.
leonard No.
sheldon You need to go to the back of the line.
man Uh, who made you line monitor?
sheldon Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
man Is this guy for real?
leonard Boy, I wish I could say no.
beverly That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.
amy Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.
beverly Your relationship with him is fascinating. I’m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.
amy Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut.
beverly Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?
bernadette Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.
beverly Wonderful. I’ll give you my contact information.
bernadette Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.
beverly About what?
penny Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere.
beverly Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?
penny What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face.
beverly My intention was never to insult you.
penny You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
beverly Well, it’s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.
penny Okay, good example.
sheldon What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
man The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
sheldon They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?
man As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.
raj He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.
sheldon Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?
man Told you.
sheldon Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you.
howard I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair.
sheldon You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.
leonard Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.
sheldon Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…
woman Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.
sheldon I most certainly did not.
woman I saw you.
man If you’re feeling dizzy, it’s because the tables have turned.
sheldon Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in.
leonard Buddy, let it go.
sheldon No, I can’t. This isn’t right.
leonard You did everything you could.
sheldon No, I could’ve done more.
leonard Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.
penny To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.
beverly I’m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore.
amy I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us.
penny It was spur of the moment.
bernadette But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
beverly I could’ve watched it on the Internet?
penny Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?
beverly No, I would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would’ve been nice.
penny You really think we made a mistake?
beverly At the time I did. But I’ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.
penny Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.
beverly I would find that perfectly acceptable.
penny She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
bernadette Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.
howard I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.
