penny Oh my God, I love this chicken.
sheldon Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.
penny Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.
sheldon Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.
howard Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.
raj I’ll let you know.
howard Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette mom, and the other three, mine.
sheldon Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.
leonard Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.
sheldon They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.
howard Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.
raj Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.
leonard Who you bringing?
raj Who are you bringing?
penny He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
raj Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.
howard Come on, who is it?
raj I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
sheldon Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?
howard No, uh, I don’t think so.
sheldon Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.
raj Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?
mrs_koothrappali Pretty good, can’t complain.
dr_koothrappali Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.
raj Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.
dr_koothrappali It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?
mrs_koothrappali We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.
raj No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.
dr_koothrappali What’s that?
raj It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
dr_koothrappali Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?
raj ‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife.
mrs_koothrappali And just to clarify, a female wife?
raj Yes.
dr_koothrappali Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.
mrs_koothrappali We married for love.
dr_koothrappali And it’s been wonderful.
sheldon Quantum physics makes me so happy.
leonard Yeah, I’m glad.
sheldon It’s like looking at the universe naked.
penny Hi, you guys got a minute?
leonard Sure, what’s up?
penny Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
sheldon Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.
leonard I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
sheldon Yes.
leonard Prove it.
sheldon Knock, knock.
leonard Who’s there?
sheldon Interrupting physicist.
leonard Interrupting physi…
sheldon MUON!
penny Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!
sheldon Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!
leonard Where did you get that?
penny Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.
leonard You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
penny Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
sheldon Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
penny Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?
sheldon Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
penny You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.
leonard Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.
penny Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!
leonard Awesome!
sheldon Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.
penny Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.
leonard Ah!
sheldon Oh dear Lord. No!
penny Why, they’re just toys?
sheldon They’re mint in box.
leonard They’re Collectables.
penny C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
together No!
leonard Once you open the box it loses its value.
penny Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.
bernadette Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
raj Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.
bernadette The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
howard Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
raj Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.
howard Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
raj It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
howard Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
bernadette So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?
raj Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.
girl Excuse me, are you Rajesh?
raj Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.
lakshmi Nice to meet you too.
raj Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.
bernadette Hello.
raj And this is Howard.
howard Nice to meet you.
lakshmi You too.
raj Please have a seat. I’m thinking double wedding!
voice_of_spock Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?
sheldon Is someone there?
spock Down here, on your desk.
sheldon Spock?
spock I need to speak with you.
sheldon Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
spock It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.
sheldon Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
spock I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.
sheldon But it’s mint in box.
spock Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.
sheldon Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.
spock Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?
sheldon To be played with.
spock Therefore? To not play with it would be?
sheldon Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.
spock Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.
sheldon Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. . Energise. Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. It’s only logical.
lakshmi My goodness, that was delicious.
raj Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
lakshmi Impressive. What goes into making something like that.
raj Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.
lakshmi I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.
raj Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls.
lakshmi Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.
raj I’d like to tell them things are going well.
lakshmi Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.
raj Okay, what page are you on?
lakshmi I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay.
raj Say again.
lakshmi I’m gay.
raj Like, dude on dude, but with women?
lakshmi I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.
raj Why me, of all people?
lakshmi Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.
raj I’m not gay.
lakshmi Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am.
raj That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex.
lakshmi Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?
raj I like to boogie.
lakshmi Got you.
raj W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
lakshmi That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.
raj Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.
sheldon Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
spock Hello again, Sheldon.
sheldon What is it now, tiny Spock?
spock I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.
sheldon You’re the one who told me to play with it.
spock If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?
sheldon No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.
spock Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.
sheldon Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.
spock Well I am unhappy.
sheldon I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
spock I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.
sheldon You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.
spock Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.
sheldon Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
raj Ready for lunch?
howard Yep, one sec. Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.
raj Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.
howard Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
raj We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.
howard What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?
raj Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.
howard Then why did she even go out with you?
raj She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it.
howard Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy.
raj Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
howard Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.
raj It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.
howard Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.
raj Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
howard So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
raj I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
howard Yes, to other gay people.
raj Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
sheldon Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. Nothing!
leonard What?
sheldon Nothing. I said nothing.
penny That was weird.
leonard Really? I don’t even notice any more.
penny I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
leonard Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box.
penny I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. Relax. I’m just looking at the box.
sheldon Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
penny What is your problem?
sheldon My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.
penny Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.
leonard You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.
penny Yes.
sheldon Mmmmm!
leonard It’s broken.
penny What?
sheldon Oh, nice job, man-hands.
penny I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.
sheldon Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.
penny You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.
leonard Absolutely.
sheldon Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.
leonard Why would you open mine?
sheldon I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
leonard Well, you should talk to Stuart.
sheldon I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
penny What is the truth?
sheldon My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
leonard Okay, that I believe.
penny Mmm.
sheldon Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.
leonard So, is that one mine.
sheldon Yes.
leonard Well, hand it over so I can open it.
sheldon Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.
leonard And that’s a lie, right?
sheldon Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
raj This is a treat, what brings you guys by?
bernadette Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi.
raj What, you told her?
howard I told everybody.
bernadette We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
howard Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman.
raj So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone.
bernadette Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with.
raj Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
howard Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
raj I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
bernadette Metrosexual my ass.
