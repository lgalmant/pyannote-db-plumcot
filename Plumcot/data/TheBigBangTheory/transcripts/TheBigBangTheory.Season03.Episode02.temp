howard Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
sheldon Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?
howard Okay, first of all…
raj Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person.
sheldon I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
leonard Hey, guys.
howard What are you doing here?
leonard What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
raj Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
leonard There’s more to life than sex, Raj.
howard Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?
sheldon I did.
leonard Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.
howard You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended.
raj Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
leonard It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
howard What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.
sheldon Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
raj Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
sheldon Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
leonard Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
raj Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
leonard I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.
howard Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?
raj Oh, yeah.
leonard To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…
raj Disappointed? Let down?
howard Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
leonard All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.
howard Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.
raj That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
leonard Sheldon, dinner’s here.
sheldon Tandoori Palace?
leonard No, we went somewhere new.
sheldon You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?
leonard No, look, Mumbai Palace.
sheldon Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
leonard Trust me, this will be just fine.
howard You are the authority on just fine.
leonard What’s that supposed to mean?
howard Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.
penny What are they talking about?
leonard I don’t know
sheldon I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
leonard Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
sheldon If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
penny Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
leonard Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
sheldon I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
raj Yeah, you…
howard Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out.
penny Ugh, I am so embarrassed!
leonard Please don’t be mad.
penny What did you tell them?
leonard Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.
penny Fine? You said it was fine?
leonard Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
penny It was… okay.
leonard Okay?
penny Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.
leonard So, you’ve been through this before?
penny No.
leonard Okay-dokay.
penny You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?
leonard So much.
penny Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.
leonard Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
penny Don’t talk, just drink.
howard No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them.
raj Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t.
sheldon Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. Oh, good! Now I can eat.
raj What’s that?
howard Sounds like a cricket.
sheldon Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.
howard Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?
sheldon In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
raj How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
sheldon Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.
howard Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket.
sheldon Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
howard No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.
raj Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
sheldon That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
howard Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket.
sheldon I can’t take your money.
howard What’s the matter, you chicken?
sheldon I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
raj Chickens can’t climb trees
sheldon Thank God.
howard Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me.
sheldon Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
howard I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.
sheldon All right, you have a wager.
howard Hmm.
raj Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
raj I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
leonard More wine?
penny Hit me.
sheldon I don’t see anything.
howard Shh!
raj Hallway.
sheldon One at a time. What was that?
raj My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?
howard Shh! Elevator shaft.
sheldon Help me open it.
howard Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
sheldon Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
howard Let’s open her up.
sheldon Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
howard Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.
sheldon Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
raj Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
leonard What are we drinking now?
penny Peppermint schnapps.
leonard Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
penny Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?
leonard What?
penny Schnapps.
leonard Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.
raj Be careful.
sheldon If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
raj Stairwell.
sheldon Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.
penny Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?
leonard I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. Are you okay?
raj Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
sheldon His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
raj What would you name him?
sheldon An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.
howard All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.
sheldon Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
howard That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?
raj Oh, I really don’t care anymore
leonard God, I had the most horrible night.
raj What happened?
sheldon Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
howard Shiksa. Shik-sa.
sheldon Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long.
howard Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again.
sheldon We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
howard All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor
sheldon He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.
leonard I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
raj Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here. Don’t do that!
howard You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.
raj Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
sheldon Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
prof_crawley Don’t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle?
sheldon Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
prof_crawley Who wants to know?
sheldon I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
prof_crawley Couldn’t wait, huh?
sheldon I’m sorry?
prof_crawley I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.
howard No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question.
prof_crawley Let me ask you one first. What’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
raj Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
prof_crawley What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
raj I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
sheldon No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
prof_crawley Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we’re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We’re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
howard Well, could you look at Toby?
prof_crawley Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
sheldon Told you.
prof_crawley It’s a field cricket.
howard Yes!
sheldon No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
prof_crawley Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.
sheldon Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
prof_crawley Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!
sheldon Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
raj Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
penny Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?
sheldon Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
penny What do you have a safe deposit box for?
sheldon Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
penny What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular.
sheldon Penny, I’d rather not talk about it.
penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either.
sheldon Why would that make me feel better?
penny I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard.
sheldon Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.
penny What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?
sheldon A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
penny Okay, forget the chicken.
sheldon Well, I wish I could.
penny No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
sheldon Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
penny No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
sheldon I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Hey. What’s going on?
sheldon Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
leonard Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
sheldon Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
leonard Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?
leonard Interesting.
sheldon Hardly.
leonard Excuse me.
sheldon Have I crossed some sort of line again?
leonard Little bit.
sheldon Hmm. Oh, who cares?
penny Oh, hey.
leonard Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?
penny Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
leonard Is that what you want?
penny I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
leonard I guess.
penny It would take the pressure off.
leonard It would, wouldn’t it?
penny So, we’ll just be friends.
leonard Good, good.
penny Come here.
leonard Okay-dokay
