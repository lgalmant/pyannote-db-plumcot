sheldon_cooper Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
leonard_hofstadter Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.
sheldon_cooper It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.
howard_wolowitz@raj_koothrappali Turtle power!
sheldon_cooper However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so?
sheldon_cooper I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.
raj_koothrappali an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
howard_wolowitz It’s heebie-jeebies.
raj_koothrappali I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.
howard_wolowitz Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
leonard_hofstadter Fun. We know how much you love that.
howard_wolowitz It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
sheldon_cooper You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.
sheldon_cooper No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.
howard_wolowitz Great, thank you.
sheldon_cooper Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.
raj_koothrappali What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
sheldon_cooper Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.
leonard_hofstadter That should lighten the mood.
sheldon_cooper What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Oh, right, funeral. Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?
amy_farrah_fowler I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.
sheldon_cooper You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?
sheldon_cooper Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.
amy_farrah_fowler But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.
amy_farrah_fowler Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.
howard_wolowitz So, how have you been?
mike_rostenkowski Fine.
howard_wolowitz Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
mike_rostenkowski It’s fine.
howard_wolowitz I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?
bernadette_rostenkowski I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.
howard_wolowitz I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.
bernadette_rostenkowski You could die.
howard_wolowitz Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.
mrs_rostenkowski Here’s another beer, honey.
mike_rostenkowski Thank you.
howard_wolowitz So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?
mrs_rostenkowski It was good.
howard_wolowitz Had no idea you were the chatty one.
sheldon_cooper 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.
sheldon_cooper Well, not with that attitude.
amy_farrah_fowler I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
sheldon_cooper Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.
sheldon_cooper How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
amy_farrah_fowler You, you want to rub something on my chest?
sheldon_cooper Yes. All over it.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe we should start with that.
sheldon_cooper Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m counting on it.
howard_wolowitz Okay, dig in.
mike_rostenkowski Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.
howard_wolowitz Took the words right out of my mouth.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
mike_rostenkowski I’m going next weekend.
howard_wolowitz Oh, you like to fish?
mike_rostenkowski Yes.
howard_wolowitz Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
mrs_rostenkowski Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.
howard_wolowitz You know, I hadn’t thought of that. Help me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.
howard_wolowitz No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, I think you’d have fun.
mike_rostenkowski Fine, you can tag along.
bernadette_rostenkowski Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.
howard_wolowitz Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski What thing?
howard_wolowitz You know, the thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.
mike_rostenkowski All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing.
howard_wolowitz Great. Thanks for the help.
howard_wolowitz I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.
raj_koothrappali If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.
leonard_hofstadter Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
howard_wolowitz Do either of you guys know how to fish?
leonard_hofstadter No.
raj_koothrappali No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
howard_wolowitz Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.
penny S’up?
penny Step one, worms.
howard_wolowitz Ew!
penny Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.
howard_wolowitz Really?
penny You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
penny What are you waiting for?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.
penny Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
howard_wolowitz Fine. There.
leonard_hofstadter I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
howard_wolowitz Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.
penny Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.
raj_koothrappali You got this, buddy.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.
raj_koothrappali You can do it.
penny That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.
sheldon_cooper And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.
amy_farrah_fowler That was great. Rub my chest again.
sheldon_cooper No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up.
bernadette_rostenkowski How’s the poor thing?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.
sheldon_cooper Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t have a bath thermometer.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t understand.
amy_farrah_fowler I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
bernadette_rostenkowski So you’ve just been lying to him?
amy_farrah_fowler See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.
amy_farrah_fowler All right. I’ll tell him.
sheldon_cooper Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.
penny Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. You want me to stop?
howard_wolowitz No, I’m fine. Keep going.
penny All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. Oh, my God. What is with you guys?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
penny What, never?
leonard_hofstadter My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.
raj_koothrappali Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, okay, Howard wins.
leonard_hofstadter You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.
howard_wolowitz You’re right. Oh! I should do this.
penny Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.
howard_wolowitz Here we go. Oh!
penny Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.
sheldon_cooper I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh?
sheldon_cooper I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.
sheldon_cooper It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.
amy_farrah_fowler I feel terrible I did this.
sheldon_cooper It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.
amy_farrah_fowler I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?
sheldon_cooper In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.
amy_farrah_fowler I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you saying you want to spank me?
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.
howard_wolowitz Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.
mike_rostenkowski That’s what you’re wearing?
howard_wolowitz No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
mike_rostenkowski Maybe in cartoons.
howard_wolowitz Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
mike_rostenkowski All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.
howard_wolowitz Wait, now we’re shooting things?
mike_rostenkowski I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.
howard_wolowitz Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them.
mike_rostenkowski So, why’d you agree to come?
howard_wolowitz ‘Cause Bernadette made me.
mike_rostenkowski I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.
howard_wolowitz Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.
mike_rostenkowski You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall.
howard_wolowitz So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.
mike_rostenkowski Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?
howard_wolowitz No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.
mike_rostenkowski Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.
howard_wolowitz Really? Thank you, sir.
mike_rostenkowski Call me Mike.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?
mike_rostenkowski That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about.
howard_wolowitz Great couple of gals.
mike_rostenkowski I wouldn’t go that far.
sheldon_cooper Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
amy_farrah_fowler One second. I want to put on some music.
sheldon_cooper Why?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
sheldon_cooper Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
amy_farrah_fowler Then maybe you should spank me harder.
sheldon_cooper Maybe I will.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh!
