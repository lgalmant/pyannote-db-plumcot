priya_koothrappali Morning.
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
priya_koothrappali Sleep okay?
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?
priya_koothrappali Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
priya_koothrappali Yeah, just because you’re in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that.
priya_koothrappali No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?
leonard_hofstadter I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
priya_koothrappali Oh, that’s too bad.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
priya_koothrappali If you had them on now, you could see what we’re going to do next.
leonard_hofstadter Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working on?
sheldon_cooper Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech.
raj_koothrappali Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it.
howard_wolowitz Here, shuffle these.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
howard_wolowitz Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
howard_wolowitz Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.
sheldon_cooper Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
howard_wolowitz Remind me, what’s your birthday?
raj_koothrappali October sixth.
howard_wolowitz Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.
raj_koothrappali How about that!
howard_wolowitz Is that your card?
raj_koothrappali Yes, it is. Very cool!
sheldon_cooper It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
howard_wolowitz A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Give me a second.
howard_wolowitz You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?
random_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode18 Oh, hey!
leonard_hofstadter Sorry! Oop!
leonard_hofstadter Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
penny One, two, three, four, five. No way.
howard_wolowitz That’s your card, right?
penny Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
sheldon_cooper It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
howard_wolowitz Oh, really? So how did I do it?
sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.
howard_wolowitz I thought you had more important things to think about.
sheldon_cooper I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.
penny Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
sheldon_cooper Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.
penny Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
priya_koothrappali Lets go hang everything up.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
howard_wolowitz So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
penny I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I was talking to Raj.
penny Oopsy.
sheldon_cooper This deck is rigged in some fashion.
howard_wolowitz Fine. Get another deck and I’ll do the trick with that.
sheldon_cooper So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
howard_wolowitz I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle.
penny You know, well, I’m happy Leonard has found someone. Not that anybody asked.
priya_koothrappali How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?
leonard_hofstadter Just two. Everyday and dress.
priya_koothrappali Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.
priya_koothrappali Leonard, I’m not breaking up with you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay. So, what’s up?
priya_koothrappali It’s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.
leonard_hofstadter I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.
priya_koothrappali I’m just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?
leonard_hofstadter Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.
priya_koothrappali I don’t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you’re not ready to move on.
leonard_hofstadter No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?
priya_koothrappali You need to cut the cord with Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Okay.
priya_koothrappali You don’t sound very confident.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it.
priya_koothrappali Thank you. I appreciate it.
leonard_hofstadter Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?
priya_koothrappali Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we not discuss it?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.
howard_wolowitz And was your card the jack of diamonds?
penny Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?
sheldon_cooper Um…
penny Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how I got his nose.
howard_wolowitz You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil’s rubber!
penny Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.
sheldon_cooper Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic.
penny Come here.
howard_wolowitz You’re right.
penny Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
penny Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?
leonard_hofstadter One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
penny Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny You don’t wanna wash that.
leonard_hofstadter No?
penny No, that’s silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, me, too.
penny She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, bitches are the worst.
penny All right, well I’ll see you later.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?
penny Did they make a movie about it?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny Then no.
leonard_hofstadter All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
penny Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
leonard_hofstadter Sure, that has birds in it.
penny It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.
priya_koothrappali Do you really have to wear that in bed?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
priya_koothrappali So did you get to talk to Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.
priya_koothrappali And?
leonard_hofstadter She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
priya_koothrappali Was she upset?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are.
priya_koothrappali I hope you weren’t cruel to her.
leonard_hofstadter Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?
sheldon_cooper Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.
leonard_hofstadter I am not opening that door, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper As you wish. Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed. Did you pick one?
leonard_hofstadter Yep.
sheldon_cooper Is this your card?
leonard_hofstadter Nope.
sheldon_cooper Drat. Is this your card?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper I’ll be right back.
sheldon_cooper Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.
leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doin’?
sheldon_cooper I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
leonard_hofstadter What’s up with the infrared cameras?
sheldon_cooper I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.
leonard_hofstadter Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
sheldon_cooper Relax, we’re not under attack right now.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here.
sheldon_cooper And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.
leonard_hofstadter Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
priya_koothrappali It’s okay, I like Indian food.
leonard_hofstadter Or as you probably call it back home, food.
priya_koothrappali Why didn’t you wear your contacts? Don’t you like them?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
priya_koothrappali You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.
leonard_hofstadter Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
priya_koothrappali Maybe. What do you think?
penny Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
leonard_hofstadter Small world.
priya_koothrappali You did talk to her, didn’t you?
leonard_hofstadter Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.
penny Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?
priya_koothrappali No, he did not.
penny He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny, huh?
priya_koothrappali Yes, that’s our Lenny.
penny So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.
leonard_hofstadter Bye.
priya_koothrappali Good night.
penny Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.
leonard_hofstadter It is pretty spicy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.
howard_wolowitz Really?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.
howard_wolowitz I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?
raj_koothrappali Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
sheldon_cooper All right. Pick a card.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
sheldon_cooper Bippity-boppity-boo.
howard_wolowitz What’s with the wand and the beep?
sheldon_cooper The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
raj_koothrappali These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.
sheldon_cooper I said, ta-da. Show’s over.
howard_wolowitz That’s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don’t let me see it.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
howard_wolowitz Three of clubs.
raj_koothrappali Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!
howard_wolowitz Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
sheldon_cooper That does it. I’m getting uranium.
raj_koothrappali You ever gonna tell him?
howard_wolowitz Maybe. When it stops being fun.
raj_koothrappali So never.
penny Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.
penny No, it’s all right. Walk me down. So, what’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
penny Sure, anything.
leonard_hofstadter Move out.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.
penny Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?
leonard_hofstadter Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?
penny Oh, for god’s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn’t it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you.
leonard_hofstadter Yes. There, I said it.
penny Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.
leonard_hofstadter And she likes you.
penny No, she doesn’t.
leonard_hofstadter Not really, no.
penny It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.
leonard_hofstadter Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
penny You can hear my toilet flush?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.
penny Leonard, I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?
leonard_hofstadter Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?
penny Are you really that kind of guy?
leonard_hofstadter No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
penny Good-bye, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, wait. Damned contacts.
howard_wolowitz Incoming.
raj_koothrappali Hi!
howard_wolowitz Hey!
sheldon_cooper Hello.
raj_koothrappali Why so glum, chum?
sheldon_cooper Apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?
sheldon_cooper Figure out the magic trick yet?
howard_wolowitz Want me to tell you how to do it?
sheldon_cooper No.
howard_wolowitz I’ll show you one more time. Raj?
sheldon_cooper Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there’s no monkey business.
howard_wolowitz All right. . Two of hearts.
sheldon_cooper I hate you.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, he’s gonna win the Nobel prize.
