sheldon I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.
raj Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.
sheldon Wrong. Leonard?
leonard Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.
sheldon Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?
howard Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.
leonard Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body.
sheldon Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.
leonard Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
sheldon All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight.
raj He got us again.
leonard No, he didn’t.
raj Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.
sheldon Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan.
raj I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs.
howard Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.
raj You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
howard What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more.
leonard Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.
sheldon You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
howard Well, it’s probably not for me.
raj Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.
sheldon Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in.
raj Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.
leonard Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.
penny So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.
leonard Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
penny Why should I worry?
leonard Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?
penny Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.
leonard Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.
penny Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
leonard Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.
penny Well, have fun tonight.
leonard Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.
penny Yeah, there is.
leonard You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.
leonard Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.
sheldon It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
leonard Are you drinking whisky?
sheldon Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky.
leonard Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?
wil_wheaton Hey, you guys.
leonard Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.
wil Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei’s house.
sheldon I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.
wil Oh, I’m friends with Howard too.
sheldon Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody. Aagh!
stuart Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.
leonard Oh, yeah, no worries.
stuart And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
leonard Oh, all right.
stuart And gas money to get home.
leonard Yeah, sure.
stuart Great. You know what? This is my grandfather’s watch.
leonard Oh.
stuart 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.
leonard Wow, that’s very nice.
stuart Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it’s yours.
raj Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…
all For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
kripke Yes, yes, yes. He’s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?
howard Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight.
kripke Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?
stuart You want to buy a watch?
amy This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?
bernadette Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.
penny Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.
amy All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?
bernadette Amy, please.
amy Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.
penny Okay, show’s over.
amy Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?
penny I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?
penny Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.
bernadette Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.
penny Oh, that’s cool.
amy No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later.
raj May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.
all Hear! Hear!
sheldon And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend.
wil Sheldon…
sheldon Talk to the hand.
raj Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
sheldon Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!
leonard Sheldon…
sheldon Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
leonard So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…
kripke Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.
leonard Right. To Howard.
all To Howard.
leonard I totally had sex in the ocean.
stuart Okay, I’ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can’t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I’m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.
raj Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?
kripke I’ll go. Howard, I’m gonna say something to you that evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That’s not unweasonable.
raj Hear, hear.
all Hear, hear.
raj Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.
kripke Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine.
raj I’m not done, but thank you. I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.
howard She was my second cousin.
sheldon And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
raj Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!
howard Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down.
raj Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?
howard Don’t remember. Please sit down.
raj The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here.
howard Oh, please shut up.
raj Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.
wil Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.
sheldon Jeepers, I’m drunk.
howard Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!
bernadette Funny. You boys have a nice time?
howard Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.
bernadette That’s nice.
howard How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.
rajs_voice Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite.
raj You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.
bernadette You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway.
howard Bernadette, listen…
bernadette You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!
raj Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.
howard Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.
bernadette Don’t you try and blame this on him.
raj Thank you, Bernadette.
bernadette Zip it, pervert!
bernadette I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know who the man is any more.
amy I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?
penny Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?
amy Right. And that was…
penny Not.
bernadette When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.
penny Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ’em.
bernadette Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
penny Well, a little. You hear stuff.
bernadette Why didn’t you tell me
penny Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.
bernadette My God! I thought you were my friend.
amy I don’t think that was helpful.
howard Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back.
raj Dude, I am so sorry.
howard It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you.
leonard Actually, you did do one of them together.
sheldon Here.
howard What is this?
sheldon You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
howard No, but what is it?
sheldon Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.
howard I don’t know what my next move is.
leonard Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women.
howard Yeah?
leonard No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?
raj I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
howard I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con.
raj All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
sheldon I just threw up the bachelor party.
penny Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this.
bernadette No, leave me alone.
amy Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
penny Amy.
amy Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess.
howard Oh, hi.
penny Hey.
howard I need to talk to Bernadette.
penny Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now.
howard All right, well, could you at least give her a message?
penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
howard Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.
penny Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you.
bernadette Howie?
howard Penny has a message for you.
bernadette I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls.
howard Do you want me to go?
bernadette No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.
howard I get that.
bernadette Is there anything else about your past I should know?
howard Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I’ll tell you later.
bernadette Okay.
howard So, is the wedding still on?
bernadette Yeah, the wedding’s still on.
amy Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour.
penny Oh, what the hell.
amy This is kind of hot.
leonard Hello.
penny What’s with the robe?
leonard I’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.
penny No, you’re not.
leonard Come on, please.
penny If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.
leonard Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
