penny Hey, Leonard, check this out.
sheldon Leonard, she’s doing it again.
leonard I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
sheldon No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
penny You want me to put it back?
sheldon Leonard.
leonard It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
howard What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.
sheldon Hello.
howard Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.
leonard Yeah. Hey.
howard Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles.
bernadette I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred.
howard I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.
leonard Sure. The more, the merrier.
sheldon Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating.
leonard Sheldon…
sheldon Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.
penny Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.
sheldon Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?
leonard Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys.
everyone NO!
bernadette What?
penny Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there.
bernadette Why not?
leonard That’s where Sheldon sits.
bernadette He can’t sit somewhere else?
penny Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
sheldon Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
bernadette Ooh, I love your shoes.
penny Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?
bernadette Where’d you get them?
penny Shoes for Less.
bernadette I’ve been meaning to go over there.
penny Oh, great selection, great prices.
sheldon My mother was right. Hell is real.
howard Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.
penny Womenfolk?
howard Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
penny Just eat your dinner.
bernadette Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.
penny Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny.
bernadette Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.
penny Howard, never let her go.
bernadette So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
leonard I am. Are you interested in physics?
bernadette Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.
leonard Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
bernadette That’s amazing.
sheldon Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.
bernadette Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
leonard Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?
bernadette Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.
sheldon Howard?
howard Yeah?
sheldon Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
howard What?
sheldon Bazinga. I don’t care.
raj Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.
sheldon That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
raj And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive.
sheldon Just need a little more practice.
raj What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.
penny Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
sheldon It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again.
penny It’s not about shoes.
sheldon Then speak.
penny Um, actually, can we do it in private?
sheldon All right. Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy.
penny Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
sheldon A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.
penny Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.
sheldon Why can’t Leonard teach you?
penny ‘Cause I want to surprise him.
sheldon Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
penny Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
sheldon Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.
penny You’re sitting here playing video games all day.
sheldon Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?
penny Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
sheldon The one with the frogs.
penny Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.
sheldon I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so.
penny Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.
sheldon Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.
penny Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo.
sheldon Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.
howard Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.
bernadette Who are all those people?
howard Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.
bernadette Hi.
leonard Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.
howard Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
bernadette He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works.
leonard Yeah, no, I got it.
bernadette So, how’s your experiment going?
leonard Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.
bernadette Boy, I’d love to see that.
leonard You’re welcome to come.
bernadette Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?
howard Like Hanukkah in July.
bernadette Do they have that?
howard No.
bernadette Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.
howard Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?
bernadette Sure.
howard Thanks, honey. All right, what is your deal?
leonard Excuse me?
howard Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
leonard Yeah? So?
howard Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?
leonard What are you talking about?
howard Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
leonard Has it ever worked?
howard Not so far, but that’s not the point!
leonard Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend.
howard I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy.
leonard I believe you.
sheldon Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
penny Ready to get started?
sheldon One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?
penny Um, I don’t have one.
sheldon How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
penny I have to take notes?
sheldon How else are you gonna study for the tests?
penny There’s gonna be a test?
sheldon Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
penny Thank you.
sheldon You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.
penny Ancient Greece?
sheldon Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?
penny Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?
sheldon This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
penny Twenty six hundred years?
sheldon Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?
penny I have to go to the bathroom.
sheldon Can’t you hold it?
penny Not for twenty six hundred years.
sheldon Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.
bernadette Howard?
howard Huh?
bernadette It unhooks in the front.
howard Oh, that explains a lot.
howards_mother Howard, I’m home!
howard Of course.
howards_mother Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I’m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.
howard That’s great, Ma!
howards_mother What’s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?
bernadette I guess I should go.
howard No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?
howards_mother Lamb stew? I’d have to go to the supermarket.
howard Please? I got a real hankering.
howards_mother Oh, I can’t say no to my little tushy face. I’ll be back soon.
howard Thanks, Ma.
howards_mother Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?
howard Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
howards_mother You’re right! When you’re right, you’re right! What if they’re out of the Le Seur?
howard Then get the regular!
howards_mother All right! You don’t have to yell!
howard Sorry about that.
bernadette Let me just put that on vibrate.
howard I’m already on vibrate.
bernadette You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?
howard Uh, what do you mean?
bernadette He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
howard Really? He said that?
bernadette You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?
howard Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
bernadette Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
howard I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.
sheldon Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?
penny Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
sheldon No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!
penny Sorry.
sheldon Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?
penny I don’t know.
sheldon How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
penny Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!
sheldon I’m sorry. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
penny No, you just suck at teaching.
sheldon Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?
penny Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?
sheldon All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
penny Not that far back!
sheldon Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
penny I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
sheldon Greece.
penny Damn it!
sheldon There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?
penny Squared?
sheldon No.
penny Aristotle?
sheldon No.
penny Five?
sheldon Oh!
penny Then I don’t know.
sheldon Why are you crying?
penny Because I’m stupid!
sheldon That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.
penny Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
sheldon All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
penny Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated.
sheldon It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
penny Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
sheldon A good question.
penny Thank you.
sheldon And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?
penny Oh, balls.
sheldon It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
howard Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.
leonard What did I do now?
howard I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.
leonard What?
howard We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.
leonard You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
howard Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her.
leonard What was I supposed to tell her?
howard I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.
leonard And what would that be?
howard Come on, do I have to think of everything?
bernadette Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.
howard Hi.
bernadette What are you doing here?
howard Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment.
bernadette No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid.
leonard You told her my experiment was stupid?
howard I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.
leonard Should I, um, leave you two alone?
bernadette No, Leonard, you should hear this.
leonard Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go.
howard Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not.
leonard We’re shocked.
howard Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
leonard Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.
howard But I now realize how foolish that is.
leonard He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
howard It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?
leonard I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
howard Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance.
bernadette What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?
leonard It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
bernadette Come here, tushy face.
leonard Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.
bernadette Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.
leonard I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
penny Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
