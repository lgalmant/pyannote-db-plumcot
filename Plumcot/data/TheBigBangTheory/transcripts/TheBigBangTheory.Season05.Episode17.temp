raj It was a nice retirement party.
howard I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.
leonard What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
howard I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.
sheldon These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.
leonard Can’t be very long.
raj Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Mm, indeed.
howard So sad.
sheldon Dibs.
kripke What’s up, fewwas?
sheldon What are you doing here, Kripke?
kripke Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
sheldon This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.
kripke Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.
sheldon Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.
leonard You just called dibs.
sheldon Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
kripke I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird.
rothman Gentlemen.
all Professor Rothman.
rothman Good evening.
all Good evening.
raj I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
amy I got you a little something.
penny A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.
amy What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
penny Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.
amy No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.
penny Okay.
amy I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
penny Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
amy Do you like it?
penny Do I like it? Wow.
amy So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?
penny Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…
amy No problem.
penny Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.
sheldon I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?
siebert Can’t this wait?
sheldon I’m sorry. We just need a word.
siebert Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my penis?
kripke Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies.
siebert What do you want?
kripke Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?
siebert Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?
sheldon We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
siebert Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it.
sheldon Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.
kripke Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.
sheldon Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.
siebert Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind.
kripke Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak.
sheldon Kripke?
kripke Yes?
sheldon You’re in my spot.
bernadette That is big.
penny So big.
bernadette And ugly.
penny So ugly. What am I gonna do?
bernadette I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.
penny Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
bernadette That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
penny All right, it’s got to go.
bernadette What will you tell Amy?
penny How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
bernadette Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.
penny Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.
bernadette Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting.
raj Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.
howard It’s numbered.
raj Ooh, limited edition. Nice.
sheldon Oh, that’ll be Kripke.
leonard What’s he doing here?
sheldon We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea.
kripke Cooper.
sheldon Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?
kripke Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks.
sheldon Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
kripke We’re not fwiends.
sheldon Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.
kripke How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?
sheldon You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?
raj How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
kripke What the fwig is that?
sheldon Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
all Hail.
kripke How does it work?
sheldon Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
kripke I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?
sheldon Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
kripke Almost got it. One more time.
sheldon Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…
howard Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you.
sheldon Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.
howard It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.
leonard H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
kripke You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.
leonard It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
raj Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
both Sports.
leonard All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?
sheldon Five what?
leonard Balls in the basket.
sheldon Ew!
kripke It’s out, wight?
kripke Time. Wan out of woom.
leonard You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
raj Yeah.
leonard I get it.
sheldon Hey! He did that on purpose,
leonard No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
kripke Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.
leonard No. No, I’m not.
sheldon Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. I’m gonna need more force.
kripke Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. Do I get points for that?
leonard All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else.
sheldon What do you propose?
leonard Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
kripke Oh, you are going down, Cooper.
sheldon I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.
leonard All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three.
howard Sheldon was higher.
leonard Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.
sheldon Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
amy Oh, what a great movie.
penny I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
amy My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
bernadette I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.
amy I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.
penny Good night, real Amy.
amy You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving.
bernadette Good night, real Penny.
penny Bye.
bernadette Good night, transvestite Penny.
penny Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.
amy You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.
penny Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.
amy Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?
penny It’s right over there.
amy Why?
penny I have no idea. That is weird.
amy You hate it.
penny No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.
amy I feel like an idiot.
penny No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.
amy Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.
penny Oh, Amy, come on.
amy I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.
sheldon Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.
raj I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.
sheldon Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.
raj Thank you.
sheldon Yeah. Call first.
rothman Oh. Hello.
sheldon Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.
rothman I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.
penny I came to say I’m sorry.
amy Don’t bother.
penny Oh, Amy, please.
amy I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.
penny I know.
amy I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
penny You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
amy Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.
penny I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
amy I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.
penny Amy, come on…
amy If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.
penny Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life.
amy I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now.
penny Grab your hammer.
amy No. Damage is done.
penny Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.
amy Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.
penny Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…
amy You have such a good heart.
penny Huh, I try.
amy Come on.
penny Well where are we going?
amy We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
penny Well, what about Bernadette?
amy Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
howard Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
sheldon Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.
leonard Why is there a hole here?
raj Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.
sheldon Is it? Listen.
raj What, you don’t like wind chimes?
sheldon No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.
howard The bird?
sheldon Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.
raj So?
sheldon You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?
howard The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
sheldon No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!
leonard Sheldon, relax.
sheldon How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
leonard If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?
sheldon What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
penny How’s that?
amy Little higher on the right.
penny Now?
amy Little more. No. That’s got it.
penny Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.
amy I’ll let you in on a little secret.
penny Mm.
amy Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.
penny Yeah, good call.
amy But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.
penny You’re talking about the painting, right?
amy Sure.
sheldon Help! Somebody help!
leonard What happened?
sheldon I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
leonard Why would you do that?
sheldon It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
leonard Hang in there. I’ll be right back.
