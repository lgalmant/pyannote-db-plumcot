leonard Hey.
penny Hi, how was the screening?
leonard Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.
penny Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.
leonard How’d it go with my mother?
penny Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.
leonard Wow. Well done.
penny Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.
leonard Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.
penny No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.
leonard Wait, we’re gonna get married again?
penny Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.
leonard Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
penny Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.
leonard Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her.
penny Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?
leonard I just said why, we don’t like her.
penny Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.
leonard Is your brother out of prison?
penny Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.
leonard I’d love it if my dad could come.
penny Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.
leonard Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.
penny Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.
penny Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.
amy So there’s no maid of honour?
penny No.
amy Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?
penny I don’t see how I could.
amy Then I graciously accept.
bernadette Who’s going to officiate?
penny I was kind of hoping you would.
amy Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?
sheldon Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
penny Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?
sheldon Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.
bernadette Who’s Erno Rubik?
sheldon Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.
penny Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?
sheldon Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.
bernadette Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother.
penny Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.
beverly How dare you invite your father without consulting me.
leonard Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.
beverly You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.
leonard I know, and there’s no excuse for that.
beverly He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years.
leonard I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that.
howard Oh, my God. It’s working.
raj You sure?
howard Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.
raj You’re right. You realize what this means?
howard Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.
raj Congratulations.
howard Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.
raj Open it.
howard Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird.
raj Is there a window around here we don’t know about?
howard I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
raj Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.
mary_cooper Thank you for picking me up.
sheldon Oh, you’re welcome.
mary I was speaking to your young lady.
amy My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.
mary Oh, please call me Mary.
amy Okay, Mary.
sheldon You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.
mary Sheldon, don’t be silly.
sheldon Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.
mary It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.
sheldon Well, actually, I…
amy It sure was.
mary I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.
sheldon Excuse me, I take care of him.
mary Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?
amy Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow.
sheldon Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here.
mary Oh, Beverly. How nice.
amy You’ve met her, right?
mary Yes, I have.
sheldon Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.
mary Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic.
beverly So, Mary, how have you been?
mary Well, thank you so much for asking. I’ve been well, and you?
beverly Very good.
mary Good.
sheldon I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great.
mary Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming.
beverly My ex-husband.
mary Oh, I’m so sorry.
beverly Don’t be.
mary All right.
penny Whew, chilly.
amy I think I can see my breath.
beverly We can hear you.
penny Sorry.
amy Sorry.
howard I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.
bernadette Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting.
howard Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.
raj Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.
howard Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.
bernadette You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?
howard I’m sorry, you find this funny?
raj No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.
leonard Oh, we have to use the stairs.
alfred_hofstadter When are they gonna fix your elevator?
leonard Uh, I don’t, any day now.
alfred Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.
leonard Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here.
alfred Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.
leonard Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
alfred Ah, she’s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.
leonard Thanks, Dad.
alfred How the hell did you do that?
sheldon Isn’t this nice?
leonard Hey, we’re here.
penny Alfred. Thank you for coming!
alfred Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.
penny Thank you.
leonard Dad, you remember Sheldon.
sheldon Dr. Hofstadter.
alfred Dr. Cooper.
leonard This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary.
alfred How do you do?
mary Nice to meet you.
leonard And his girlfriend, Amy.
alfred A pleasure.
amy Hi.
leonard And, of course, Mom.
alfred Hello, my hateful shrew.
beverly Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.
sheldon All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension.
leonard All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?
alfred Of course. I’m sorry.
beverly Oh, look at that, you can apologize.
leonard Mom.
beverly I’m sorry.
mary You know, the Bible says forgiveness…
sheldon Mom.
mary I’m sorry.
penny Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
sheldon It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon I’m not sorry. That’s true.
howard I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?
raj You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
bernadette Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner.
howard One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it.
raj Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.
bernadette Are you done with this nonsense?
howard It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.
raj Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.
howard You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.
raj I also love the enemies of America.
beverly Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another.
penny No, of course not.
beverly Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.
leonard Mom, please save something for the toast.
mary So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?
alfred Oh, I’m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.
mary My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.
sheldon Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking.
amy Play with your phone.
alfred Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.
mary I don’t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that’s very interesting.
alfred Oh. I, I didn’t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
mary Really?
alfred Yes. Yes, I’m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.
mary Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.
raj Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.
howard Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
raj What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.
howard I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.
bernadette Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you.
raj I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
penny You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?
beverly Yeah.
leonard Is that Howard in front of us?
penny Oh, maybe. Get closer.
howard Oh, God. I think someone’s following us.
bernadette You’re being ridiculous.
howard I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail.
raj Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.
penny Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way.
leonard I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.
penny Oh, so follow him.
raj Oh, no.
howard I told you.
bernadette It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.
penny Well, go faster. You’re losing him.
leonard What is his hurry?
penny You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you.
howard He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?
raj I, I think he wants us to pull over.
bernadette Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.
howard Hang on.
alfred So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?
mary No, just focused on work and the church.
alfred Ah. And what do you do?
mary I work at the church.
alfred Well, they’re lucky to have you.
mary Well, thank you.
alfred You’re welcome.
amy Do you realize what’s happening here?
sheldon Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.
leonard Hey.
penny Hey.
amy What took you guys so long?
leonard Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.
penny So, what did we miss?
alfred Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.
mary Leonard, your father is just charming.
beverly He’s also broke. Did he mention that?
leonard Okay, Mom, you sit over there.
penny Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.
sheldon If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.
bernadette Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while.
howard I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me.
alfred Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.
mary Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father.
sheldon That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.
amy I’d be lost without you.
leonard Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
sheldon See, that’s funny because…
amy Back to your phone.
leonard Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.
penny Oh, thanks for asking until I did.
amy Hear, hear.
leonard Cheers.
alfred I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.
penny Aw.
alfred Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.
beverly What the hell is that supposed to mean?
alfred Why don’t you take a pill?
beverly Like you did before sex?
alfred What I really needed was a blindfold.
beverly Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?
mary When God writes one, I will.
penny Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.
alfred Leonard, if you don’t mind, I, I think I’m a little tired. I’m gonna call it a night.
leonard Sure, Dad.
mary I’m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.
alfred Would you like to share a cab?
mary That would be fine.
alfred Where are you staying?
mary I’m at the Westin.
alfred Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?
mary I think that you could.
leonard What is happening there?
sheldon I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
sheldon She’s still not answering.
leonard My father’s not texting me back.
penny ‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
sheldon I don’t like this at all.
leonard I don’t like it either.
penny Really? ‘Cause I love it.
