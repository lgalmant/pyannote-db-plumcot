penny Whatcha doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
penny Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?
sheldon_cooper Is it morning?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Then I’ve been up all night.
penny And you’re stuck?
sheldon_cooper Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
penny Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
penny What is he doing now?
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
sheldon_cooper Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
leonard_hofstadter Aye, aye, Captain.
sheldon_cooper I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe you need a fresh start.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…
howard_wolowitz How long has he been stuck?
leonard_hofstadter Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
sheldon_cooper Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
howard_wolowitz Have you tried rebooting him?
leonard_hofstadter No, I think it’s a firmware problem.
raj_koothrappali Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?
howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating.
leonard_hofstadter I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
howard_wolowitz What could be better? We’re in.
raj_koothrappali Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
howard_wolowitz You can come with us.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com.
sheldon_cooper Structure, constant structure. One atom…
howard_wolowitz Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
howard_wolowitz I thought I smelled popcorn.
sheldon_cooper Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…
leonard_hofstadter I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
raj_koothrappali Hey, those are my lima beans!
sheldon_cooper Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
raj_koothrappali But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie.
leonard_hofstadter Here, you want my peas?
sheldon_cooper Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.
howard_wolowitz Want my corn?
sheldon_cooper Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
leonard_hofstadter So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?
howard_wolowitz Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?
howard_wolowitz Not this time, I promise.
raj_koothrappali Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
sheldon_cooper The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
raj_koothrappali Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?
penny Not recently.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.
penny For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
leonard_hofstadter You had some nice moves out there, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. You, too.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
howard_wolowitz Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
bernadette_rostenkowski When Howard tried to do the splits…
penny Shh.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
penny Oh, poor baby.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
penny Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God! Are you…
sheldon_cooper Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
penny Oh, damn.
leonard_hofstadter Are you okay?
penny Do I look okay?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t bark at me. I fell, too.
penny Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
sheldon_cooper The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
bernadette_rostenkowski With marbles?
sheldon_cooper Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
penny Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
leonard_hofstadter No, that’s a crazy thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?
sheldon_cooper They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
bernadette_rostenkowski Which leads to…?
sheldon_cooper Impaired cognitive function.
bernadette_rostenkowski Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
sheldon_cooper But I don’t want to go to bed.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m going to count to three. One…
sheldon_cooper Oh, all right.
leonard_hofstadter That was amazing how you handled him.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
penny Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
penny Well, it creeps me out.
leonard_hofstadter Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.
penny Just answer the phone.
leonard_hofstadter Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there.
penny What happened?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
penny Okay. Have fun.
leonard_hofstadter Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
security_guard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Ball pit.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks for not calling the cops.
security_guard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a kid who’s special.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
sheldon_cooper Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
sheldon_cooper Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.
sheldon_cooper But I’m still working.
leonard_hofstadter If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out.
sheldon_cooper You can try, but you’ll never catch me.
leonard_hofstadter For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!
sheldon_cooper Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga.
sheldon_cooper Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
leonard_hofstadter What! What, what, what?
sheldon_cooper Leonard and Penny.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I have good news.
leonard_hofstadter And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
sheldon_cooper Your cell phone was off.
leonard_hofstadter Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
sheldon_cooper And that didn’t work out, did it?
penny Sheldon, what do you want?
sheldon_cooper I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
leonard_hofstadter Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
sheldon_cooper No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
penny Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper Einstein.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m going to need a little more.
sheldon_cooper Albert Einstein.
leonard_hofstadter Keep going.
sheldon_cooper When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.
leonard_hofstadter So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?
sheldon_cooper Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds like a great plan.
sheldon_cooper Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.
penny Leonard doesn’t snore.
sheldon_cooper No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Told you.
employment_office_assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for a job.
sheldon_cooper A menial job. Like yours.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?
sheldon_cooper I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 No.
sheldon_cooper Shouldn’t you check your database?
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 No.
sheldon_cooper You didn’t really type.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?
sheldon_cooper Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
sheldon_cooper I could do that.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Good.
sheldon_cooper One question.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Yes?
sheldon_cooper What’s sheetrock?
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
sheldon_cooper That seems acceptable.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Do you have your own car?
sheldon_cooper I don’t drive.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?
sheldon_cooper Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory.
assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 I see. Just give me a second. Security!
penny Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you.
sheldon_cooper Behind you.
penny Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
penny No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
penny You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
sheldon_cooper Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
penny Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks, Sheldon.
penny Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
sheldon_cooper All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Double guacamole?
sheldon_cooper Of course.
leonard_hofstadter No cilantro?
sheldon_cooper Nope.
leonard_hofstadter Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
sheldon_cooper Yep.
leonard_hofstadter You understand why I’m doing this to you?
sheldon_cooper I do.
leonard_hofstadter That’ll be all. That was fun.
raj_koothrappali How long can he keep this up?
leonard_hofstadter I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
raj_koothrappali He never went back to the university?
leonard_hofstadter Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
raj_koothrappali Sheesh.
howard_wolowitz I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
raj_koothrappali But he’s afraid of dogs.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.
penny Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon took our order.
penny Sheldon doesn’t work here.
leonard_hofstadter Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either.
sheldon_cooper Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
penny Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
howard_wolowitz Happy now?
raj_koothrappali I’m on a cloud. Swing me.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, come here.
