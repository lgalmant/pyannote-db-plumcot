leonard Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
howard Yes, actual women are the best.
sheldon I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
leonard Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?
howard No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.
leonard What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
howard There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.
leonard Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
raj Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
leonard Got it.
howard Seen it.
sheldon Detailed analysis posted online.
raj Well, then what are we going to do tonight?
leonard Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.
howard Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.
leonard How did we get actual women?
raj Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?
sheldon It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
raj We do?
sheldon Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
raj I don’t want to do that.
sheldon All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
raj What about me?
sheldon Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.
raj Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
sheldon I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.
raj Race riots?
sheldon The zoot suit riots.
raj Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?
sheldon I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
raj No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
sheldon That’s a semantically null sentence.
raj Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.
sheldon Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.
raj Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.
sheldon If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
raj I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
sheldon Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.
raj Oh, boy.
sheldon One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.
raj I don’t want to go to Flatland.
sheldon You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
raj Oy.
sheldon Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.
raj Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone.
sheldon Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.
raj What?
sheldon Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
leonard I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant.
bernadette Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.
howard Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?
penny That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
bernadette Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?
howard Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.
bernadette How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?
penny Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
leonard Great. How come?
penny Well, promise you won’t make fun of me.
leonard Of course, I would never make fun of you.
penny Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial.
leonard Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?
howard Good job not making fun of her.
penny She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.
leonard Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site.
penny Why are you being such a jerk?
leonard You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
penny Ha-ha, bite me.
leonard Come on, Penny.
howard Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.
bernadette I’m sliding into third.
raj Thanks for coming with me.
sheldon Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
raj Did you really have to bring it in with you?
sheldon What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
raj Come on, let’s get a drink.
sheldon I don’t drink.
raj Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.
sheldon I would like a root beer float.
raj Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream.
sheldon They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.
raj He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
sheldon And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
raj Okay, let’s check out the females.
sheldon All right. There’s a female.
raj That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old.
sheldon But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
raj No. I’m looking for a hookup.
sheldon Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
raj Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.
sheldon Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
raj You help me run my game.
sheldon Okay. What is your game?
sheldon When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
girl Hey, that’s pretty cool. What is it?
sheldon It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
girl You’re very funny. I’m Abby.
sheldon I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
raj How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
abby Hi, Raj. Where are you from?
raj The mysterious subcontinent of India.
abby Ooh, India.
raj You know India?
abby I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
raj Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.
sheldon I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry.
abby Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.
martha Hi.
raj Hello.
sheldon Hello.
martha Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
sheldon In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
martha Oh, that is so awesome.
sheldon Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
bernadette So, what should we talk about?
howard Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?
penny Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
leonard I’m sorry, but facts are facts.
penny Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact.
leonard No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact.
penny Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
leonard You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
penny Amazing. Would you like to try some?
leonard Yeah, sure.
penny Well, the fact is, you can’t.
leonard Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here.
howard What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
bernadette No, thank you.
howard Sorry.
leonard Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
penny Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
waiter How is everything tonight?
bernadette Really uncomfortable.
leonard You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… Want your fish? I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse.
leonard What’s going on?
sheldon We scored. I’m the wingman.
howard Hey.
leonard Laser.
howard Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.
leonard What the hell is eighth base?
howard Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?
leonard Oh, couldn’t be better.
howard Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
leonard It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
howard All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon.
leonard How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
howard Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.
leonard And that didn’t bother you?
howard Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
leonard What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?
howard Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you.
leonard Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.
howard Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the
leonard What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard.
howard I respect that.
leonard What is that?
howard Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
sheldon The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. One minute.Sis.
raj What was that?
sheldon It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish.
raj जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
sheldon I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
raj I don’t get it. You had a great time.
sheldon Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again.
raj Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha.
sheldon Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
raj My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
sheldon Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years.
raj So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
sheldon Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
raj You can’t wear the hands on the date.
sheldon Hulk sad.
leonard Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.
penny Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
leonard No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.
penny Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
leonard Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
penny I would not.
leonard Okay, let’s go see your psychic.
penny Really?
leonard Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.
penny You saying I don’t have an open mind?
leonard No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.
penny You know, I believe in ghosts, too.
leonard Great.
penny And astrology.
leonard I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.
penny Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work.
leonard Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
penny Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo.
martha Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.
sheldon You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late.
martha Uh-huh.
sheldon Time for bed.
martha Okay.
sheldon Good night, puny human! .
martha Sheldon?
sheldon Yes?
martha Listen, they’re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
sheldon Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night.
