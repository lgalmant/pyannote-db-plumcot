scene The apartment
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, your tag’s sticking out.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in, like, two years.
bernadette_rostenkowski Now I feel a little gross.
raj_koothrappali You’re only making it seem more real for me.
howard_wolowitz Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me.
raj_koothrappali Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
sheldon_cooper How about Penny’s depressing acting career?
leonard_hofstadter Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
penny Aw, thank you.
howard_wolowitz Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
raj_koothrappali Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
amy_farrah_fowler Can I borrow it when you’re done?
penny Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you do that?
penny Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
bernadette_rostenkowski Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
sheldon_cooper She does. 42 minutes in.
raj_koothrappali While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
sheldon_cooper I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.
penny Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
sheldon_cooper Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?
leonard_hofstadter So are you really not gonna do this movie?
penny Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career.
leonard_hofstadter Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
penny Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”
raj_koothrappali If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.
amy_farrah_fowler I think we’re gonna go.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I work at the same university you do.
sheldon_cooper Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.
bernadette_rostenkowski Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
penny Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
amy_farrah_fowler I think we’re gonna go.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.
sheldon_cooper Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.
howard_wolowitz I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.
sheldon_cooper I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
raj_koothrappali Ha-a-a. Still funny.
bernadette_rostenkowski That was ten years ago.
sheldon_cooper Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
howard_wolowitz The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.
raj_koothrappali I was there. It was funny.
sheldon_cooper In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
amy_farrah_fowler Thanks for walking me to my car.
raj_koothrappali Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.
amy_farrah_fowler Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.
raj_koothrappali I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.
amy_farrah_fowler Whatever happened with your online dating?
raj_koothrappali No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
amy_farrah_fowler Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.
raj_koothrappali It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
amy_farrah_fowler Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
raj_koothrappali What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s true. Do whatever you want.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
howard_wolowitz Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
sheldon_cooper Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
howard_wolowitz Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.
sheldon_cooper Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
howard_wolowitz Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
sheldon_cooper That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
howard_wolowitz Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.
sheldon_cooper I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
howard_wolowitz No.
sheldon_cooper I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.
raj_koothrappali Amy, I could use some help.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
raj_koothrappali I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.
raj_koothrappali And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.
amy_farrah_fowler Great, so what do you need me for?
raj_koothrappali Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
amy_farrah_fowler All right.
raj_koothrappali Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.
amy_farrah_fowler Wow.
raj_koothrappali I know. Powerful stuff, huh?
amy_farrah_fowler No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.
amy_farrah_fowler Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”
raj_koothrappali Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m not gonna pretend to be you.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, what would I say to her?
raj_koothrappali Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.
sheldon_cooper Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
penny Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
penny Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.
sheldon_cooper Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…
penny Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.
sheldon_cooper Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
leonard_hofstadter Are we playing individual or teams?
raj_koothrappali Teams are fun.
sheldon_cooper Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
raj_koothrappali But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…
howard_wolowitz I really don’t think we do tha…
raj_koothrappali Do that. See?
penny Oh, hi.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?
penny Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
raj_koothrappali Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
howard_wolowitz Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…
raj_koothrappali Plane tickets? Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Will you please sto…
raj_koothrappali Stop that? Okay.
penny I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions.
leonard_hofstadter I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
penny I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
leonard_hofstadter At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
penny How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.
penny I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?
sheldon_cooper It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.
raj_koothrappali Hey, you busy?
amy_farrah_fowler No. What’s up?
raj_koothrappali Have you heard back from Emily?
amy_farrah_fowler I have.
raj_koothrappali Great. And?
amy_farrah_fowler And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.
raj_koothrappali I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.
amy_farrah_fowler I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
raj_koothrappali I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
raj_koothrappali What’s happening tomorrow night?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m meeting her for coffee.
raj_koothrappali What?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
raj_koothrappali I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?
amy_farrah_fowler No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting.
raj_koothrappali Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
howard_wolowitz That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.
bernadette_rostenkowski What are you doing?
howard_wolowitz Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
howard_wolowitz You’re the reason I’m doing it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
howard_wolowitz How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
howard_wolowitz Hey, buddy.
bernadette_rostenkowski You excited for Texas?
sheldon_cooper Oh, very much so.
howard_wolowitz It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
sheldon_cooper Oh, who’s the real astronaut?
howard_wolowitz Buzz Aldrin.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Yay.
sheldon_cooper Howard? Howard? Howard?
howard_wolowitz What now?
sheldon_cooper I have to go to the bathroom.
howard_wolowitz You just went to the bathroom.
sheldon_cooper But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.
howard_wolowitz Well, it still doesn’t.
sheldon_cooper I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
howard_wolowitz Fine.
sheldon_cooper Why are you getting annoyed?
howard_wolowitz I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
sheldon_cooper Like when?
howard_wolowitz When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous.
sheldon_cooper Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?
howard_wolowitz No.
sheldon_cooper But I still need to use the bathroom.
howard_wolowitz Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?
sheldon_cooper No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
howard_wolowitz Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.
sheldon_cooper I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!
howard_wolowitz I’m gonna need that bag back.
leonard_hofstadter You sure you want to do this?
penny Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.
penny I know. Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
penny It’s just so humiliating.
leonard_hofstadter So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.
penny Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.
leonard_hofstadter I know. I thought we’d take yours.
penny I don’t understand.
leonard_hofstadter It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.
penny I don’t know what to say.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t say anything.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.
raj_koothrappali Hello, Emily.
emily_sweeney Hello.
raj_koothrappali Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?
emily_sweeney No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
raj_koothrappali Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
emily_sweeney I’m leaving.
amy_farrah_fowler Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
emily_sweeney You know, I think I’m just gonna go by myself.
raj_koothrappali Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.
sheldon_cooper If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life.
howard_wolowitz Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.
announcement#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode17 The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You’re now free to move about the cabin.
howard_wolowitz It’s over.
sheldon_cooper Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Should we stop holding hands now?
sheldon_cooper In a minute.
howard_wolowitz Okay, good.
