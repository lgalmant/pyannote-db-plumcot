russian_mission_control Launch step twelve reading okay.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 Launch step twelve acknowledged.
howard_wolowitz Hey Mike?
mike_massimino Yeah.
howard_wolowitz I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.
mike_massimino Good one.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
sheldon_cooper 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.
amy_farrah_fowler I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?
sheldon_cooper Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.
amy_farrah_fowler The uterus quivers, does it not?
leonard_hofstadter There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch.
raj_koothrappali You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.
sheldon_cooper Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.
bernadette_rostenkowski Give me those damn Pringles.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 Are all of the systems of the ship ready?
russian_mission_control Da.
mike_massimino Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?
howard_wolowitz Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?
mike_massimino Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?
howard_wolowitz Check.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?
howard_wolowitz No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.
mike_massimino Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 Congratulations.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?
howard_wolowitz Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.
howard_wolowitz Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again.
howard_wolowitz No, here.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me.
howard_wolowitz Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God.
howard_wolowitz Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.
howard_wolowitz Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.
debbie_wolowitz ‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?
howard_wolowitz No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married.
howard_wolowitz What?
bernadette_rostenkowski I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
howard_wolowitz But I’m leaving in two days.
debbie_wolowitz What about Apple Jacks?
howard_wolowitz I don’t need to take cereal.
debbie_wolowitz What kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in Russia?
howard_wolowitz They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.
debbie_wolowitz They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go.
bernadette_rostenkowski We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.
howard_wolowitz Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.
debbie_wolowitz You know what, I’ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.
bernadette_rostenkowski So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.
leonard_hofstadter That’s so great.
howard_wolowitz I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us.
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.
bernadette_rostenkowski That wasn’t going to be our processional music.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it was going to be mine.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun.
sheldon_cooper That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, what do you say, Amy?
amy_farrah_fowler Can I wear my maid of honour dress?
bernadette_rostenkowski Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?
penny Amy, you look great.
amy_farrah_fowler I know.
leonard_hofstadter Where’d you get a beer?
raj_koothrappali From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know.
amy_farrah_fowler Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?
sheldon_cooper It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?
howard_wolowitz You proposed to Penny?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it.
raj_koothrappali Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
leonard_hofstadter She said no, can we drop it now?
penny It wasn’t a real proposal.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why wasn’t it a real proposal?
sheldon_cooper He asked her during coitus.
howard_wolowitz Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette.
penny Good move telling Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?
amy_farrah_fowler All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.
registrar#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 Folks, can I have your attention. It’s five o’clock, we’re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, no.
howard_wolowitz I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.
registrar#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 Yeah, me, too. I’ll see you there.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don’t get a dog, I’m not walking it, I’m not feeding it, I’m not picking up after it.
mike_massimino You know you’re going to wind up walking it.
cosmonaut#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 I know.
howard_wolowitz Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?
mike_massimino Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.
dimitri Okay, I’m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.
mike_massimino Is that better?
howard_wolowitz Thanks.
howard_wolowitz You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, isn’t that kind of tacky?
penny Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are any of them still married?
penny Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s got to be some place special we could do it.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Will you shut up?
raj_koothrappali Well, I know how to make it special.
howard_wolowitz I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.
raj_koothrappali Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.
all@ Oh!
leonard_hofstadter That’s so cool.
howard_wolowitz Oh, wait to go, Raj.
raj_koothrappali I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.
howard_wolowitz Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.
leonard_hofstadter How about our roof?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I like that.
howard_wolowitz That’s great.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.
howard_wolowitz So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony.
penny Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great, well, who’s it going to be?
sheldon_cooper I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
sheldon_cooper What do you see in her?
dimitri Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?
howard_wolowitz Leaking? What’s leaking?
dimitri Fuel. Shh.
russian_mission_control Not bad. We feel okay to go.
dimitri Okay, thanks Mission Control.
howard_wolowitz There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?
mike_massimino Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.
dimitri This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.
howard_wolowitz What happens on the tenth time?
dimitri Problem.
howard_wolowitz Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.
raj_koothrappali Oh, thanks, man.
sheldon_cooper You didn’t have to do that.
howard_wolowitz Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, wow.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so?
sheldon_cooper I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.
leonard_hofstadter I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
sheldon_cooper Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.
amy_farrah_fowler Who is it?
howard_wolowitz It’s the groom.
amy_farrah_fowler Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
howard_wolowitz Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why can’t she drive herself?
howard_wolowitz She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right, just hurry!
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start.
raj_koothrappali What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready.
howard_wolowitz Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?
debbie_wolowitz I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to fall off the roof.
howard_wolowitz You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
raj_koothrappali Penny.
mike_rostenkowski Your new mother-in-law’s a piece of work.
bernadette_rostenkowski Not now, Dad.
mike_rostenkowski She’s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Here you go? What am I, a football?
mike_rostenkowski Like that guy could catch a football.
raj_koothrappali Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.
debbie_wolowitz Louder!
bernadette_rostenkowski They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.
raj_koothrappali Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute.
penny Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm.
penny Problem?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
penny Oh, grow up.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, I didn’t say it.
amy_farrah_fowler All right, that’s enough from the both of you.
penny Well, he started it.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
sheldon_cooper Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
sheldon_cooper Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.
raj_koothrappali I believe you two have prepared vows?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.
howard_wolowitz Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.
debbie_wolowitz Speak up!
howard_wolowitz Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you.
all@ By the power vested in us, by the state of California…
sheldon_cooper And the Klingon High Council…
all@ We now pronounce you husband and wife.
mike_massimino That’s ignition. I love this part.
dimitri Me, too.
howard_wolowitz I have strongly mixed feelings.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, it’s happening.
penny Did I miss it?
leonard_hofstadter No, come on in. Hurry.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love that man.
raj_koothrappali Me, too.
penny I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.
leonard_hofstadter This is it.
sheldon_cooper Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Oy vay!
