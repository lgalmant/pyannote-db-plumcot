amy_farrah_fowler And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.
leonard_hofstadter That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
amy_farrah_fowler About five weeks.
penny Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.
penny Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?
amy_farrah_fowler They didn’t say.
leonard_hofstadter Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
penny Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
penny Of course. You can stay in Leonard’s room, and we’ll stay at my place.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re sure that’s not an inconvenience?
penny No, not at all.
leonard_hofstadter And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.
amy_farrah_fowler So, technically, I’d be moving in with my boyfriend?
penny I guess so. And I’d finally get to live alone with my husband.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my, this is a big step.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm. For two of us, it’s in the right direction.
sheldon_cooper Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
sheldon_cooper Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That’s a great deal to process.
leonard_hofstadter It’s only for five weeks.
penny Yeah, and we’ll be right across the hall.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you think?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. What if living together kills the romance?
penny Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she’s never even seen me unshaven.
leonard_hofstadter You just shaved yesterday. You’re good for three months.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?
sheldon_cooper Don’t try luring me in with sexy talk.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.
sheldon_cooper If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that’s how you do it.
penny Don’t be proud of that.
amy_farrah_fowler So, is that a yes?
sheldon_cooper Not yet. How will I learn if I’m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I’m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.
penny Well, where would you go?
sheldon_cooper Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.
leonard_hofstadter And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914
penny Wait. Why don’t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?
sheldon_cooper Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I’d need to knock every time I came over here.
leonard_hofstadter That’s a good question. Maybe just don’t come over.
sheldon_cooper Historically, I don’t do well with change.
penny Okay, it won’t be that bad. We wouldn’t even sit in your spot while you’re gone.
sheldon_cooper You’re darn right, you wouldn’t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.
leonard_hofstadter Just nod and smile. He’s almost gone.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what do you think?
sheldon_cooper Very well. I’m on board.
amy_farrah_fowler Seriously?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. This is so exciting.
sheldon_cooper Well, now, don’t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it’s cancelled in three.
raj_koothrappali I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.
howard_wolowitz Cool. ‘Cause she says you’re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn’t have to be at every appointment.
raj_koothrappali I’m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful.
bernadette_rostenkowski It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
raj_koothrappali The polite response is, thank you for noticing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that’s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, we could name him Blobert.
bernadette_rostenkowski What if it’s a girl?
howard_wolowitz Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
raj_koothrappali If you want, you can find out right now.
howard_wolowitz Mm.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hmm. The doctor’s gone for the day, so it doesn’t matter.
raj_koothrappali Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.
bernadette_rostenkowski You looked in our folder?!
raj_koothrappali It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It’s not my fault I opened it and looked.
howard_wolowitz So you know the sex of our baby, and we don’t?
raj_koothrappali Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
howard_wolowitz It’s unbelievable.
bernadette_rostenkowski God, Raj.
raj_koothrappali What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don’t want to know, I don’t have to tell you.
bernadette_rostenkowski We don’t want you to know.
raj_koothrappali Okay, well, that’s a problem.
penny You know, I’m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Thank you.
penny Mm.
sheldon_cooper Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it’d be such a party, we’d never get anything done.
penny That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?
sheldon_cooper Well, you’ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?
penny Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.
sheldon_cooper You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.
amy_farrah_fowler You’ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?
leonard_hofstadter I’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this.
penny I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.
leonard_hofstadter Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.
penny Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.
leonard_hofstadter Keep M&M’S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
penny You’re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other’s personal space.
leonard_hofstadter He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.
sheldon_cooper How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. I didn’t count.
sheldon_cooper You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?
sheldon_cooper Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Talk.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.
sheldon_cooper Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we’re more settled in, we can revisit it.
sheldon_cooper You’re really okay with that?
amy_farrah_fowler I’ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.
sheldon_cooper This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn’t get you all worked up, I’d kiss you right now.
amy_farrah_fowler Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
sheldon_cooper I know. They probably shouldn’t sell those to children.
penny Well, here’s your key.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
leonard_hofstadter You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
sheldon_cooper It’s Penny’s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
penny Now, now, there’s no need to make this emotional.
amy_farrah_fowler Shall we?
sheldon_cooper I guess this is it.
leonard_hofstadter You guys have fun.
sheldon_cooper You, too. Oh, don’t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.
penny Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.
leonard_hofstadter I’m on it. 15 years from now, we’ll make guacamole together.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, please, let me go.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
penny Good night.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.
sheldon_cooper I guess the experiment begins.
penny Wa-how, we did it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Which side of the bed would you prefer?
amy_farrah_fowler Doesn’t matter to me. Your choice.
sheldon_cooper No, no, we’re living together now, everything’s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.
sheldon_cooper Well, clearly, it’s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m not refusing. I’m just trying to be considerate.
sheldon_cooper Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?
sheldon_cooper Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.
amy_farrah_fowler Great. That’s your side.
sheldon_cooper No, but I’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I’ll take that side.
sheldon_cooper Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?
amy_farrah_fowler Rising rapidly.
sheldon_cooper Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. What if we do this?
sheldon_cooper I suppose that works.
amy_farrah_fowler Great.
sheldon_cooper Although now I’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey’s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don’t?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
bernadette_rostenkowski I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
howard_wolowitz But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It’ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Everyone said I could do better.
howard_wolowitz But you didn’t listen, and presto change-o, my baby’s inside you. Ta-da.
amy_farrah_fowler Ugh. What is that? Why did you switch sides?
sheldon_cooper Be grateful I’m still in the room.
amy_farrah_fowler Comfy?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m just happy I don’t know what this memory foam remembers.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We’re both grown adults, we’ve been far more intimate than this. If you don’t want to snuggle, fine, but we’re not building a pillow wall.
sheldon_cooper Okay, well, I am sorry. I’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it. It’s Sheldon’s bedtime, he is in for the night.
penny Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
leonard_hofstadter It’s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it’s different.
penny So, what do you want to do?
leonard_hofstadter I know exactly what we are gonna do.
penny Really? You’re a genius, and that’s the first thing you come up with?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon’s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.
penny Ugh. Can we just have sex?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, don’t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.
penny Inevitable, you say?
leonard_hofstadter I’ll just let my hips do the talkin’.
howard_wolowitz Screw it. I’m calling and finding out.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good. Call him. Wait, I’m not sure I want to know.
howard_wolowitz But you just said you wanted to know.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, now I don’t know if I want to know!
raj_koothrappali Hello?
howard_wolowitz Call you back.
sheldon_cooper No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you’ll never learn.
penny Wow, where did you learn these moves?
leonard_hofstadter The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.
howard_wolowitz Okay, you’re positive you want to know?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Here we go. It’s ringing.
raj_koothrappali Hello?
bernadette_rostenkowski Wait.
howard_wolowitz Wrong number.
penny I told you not to do the worm.
leonard_hofstadter You were right.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
bernadette_rostenkowski I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, oh, oh.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing down there?
amy_farrah_fowler Hang on.
sheldon_cooper Who are you calling? Aaargh!
amy_farrah_fowler I’m so sore. I don’t think I slept two minutes last night.
penny Yeah, get it, girl.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s not what you think.
leonard_hofstadter I feel like I pulled something. Why didn’t you tell me to stop?
penny Even more not what you think.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.
leonard_hofstadter If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Good morning. See? I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. I didn’t knock, but it’s fine. So, how is everyone?
amy_farrah_fowler Miserable and exhausted.
sheldon_cooper Really? I slept great.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I didn’t, and it’s your fault.
sheldon_cooper How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.
sheldon_cooper Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?
amy_farrah_fowler The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
sheldon_cooper Wow. I anticipated we’d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?
sheldon_cooper If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
penny Was that a science diss?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Was it a good one?
leonard_hofstadter Eh.
penny Oh.
amy_farrah_fowler What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don’t even get that joke, ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables.
sheldon_cooper How dare you?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.
sheldon_cooper Whoa, whoa! Now you’re making fun of my bona fides?
amy_farrah_fowler Can’t make fun of something that’s a null set.
penny I feel like I should say damn.
leonard_hofstadter Do it.
penny Damn.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, for science, maybe I will.
sheldon_cooper For science, maybe you should.
amy_farrah_fowler Fine.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
amy_farrah_fowler Good.
sheldon_cooper Great.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you want to go to our place and make out?
sheldon_cooper Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
penny The new neighbours are weird.
