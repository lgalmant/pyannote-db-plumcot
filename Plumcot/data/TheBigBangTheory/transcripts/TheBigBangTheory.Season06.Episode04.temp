raj Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
leonard It’ll be good to have him back.
raj The Fantastic Four reunited.
sheldon Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership.
raj We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
sheldon Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker.
leonard I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
sheldon Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.
stuart I can go thirty.
sheldon Welcome aboard, old chum.
raj Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
sheldon He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.
dimitri Loops, calm down!
howard Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz
mike What’s that?
howard The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!
mike That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go.
bernadette Waiting for my husband.
man_in_suit That’s nice.
bernadette He’s coming back from outer space.
man_in_suit I think this flight’s coming from Houston.
bernadette No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!
various_others Howie! Howie!
howard Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.
howie_mandel Uh, I think they’re here for me, Ringo.
man_in_suit Mr. Mandel, I’m your driver.
howie_mandel Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he’s an astronaut.
bernadette I missed you so much.
howard I missed you, too. Where are the guys?
bernadette Oh, it’s just me.
howard Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised.
bernadette No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me.
howard Gesundheit. You okay?
bernadette I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants.
howard Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.
sheldon You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.
amy Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.
sheldon Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
penny You’re unbelievable.
sheldon I know.
leonard All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?
penny How about boys versus girls?
sheldon Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.
penny Once again, unbelievable.
sheldon Yeah, once again, I know.
penny All right, round one. Here.
sheldon Got it.
penny Okay. Ready, set, go.
amy Uh, box? Uh, window?
leonard Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
amy Uh, gift? Uh, Present!
penny Present! Yeah!
sheldon Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?
leonard In what universe is that a present?
sheldon It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.
penny Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.
sheldon It’s a quark-gluon plasma.
leonard No.
sheldon It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
leonard Nothing with quarks.
sheldon It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
leonard No.
penny It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
amy Yes.
leonard How could you miss that?
sheldon Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.
leonard Penny got it.
sheldon Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.
leonard Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.
amy Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?
penny Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
sheldon There.
leonard A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…
amy Now?
penny Soon.
sheldon Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.
leonard I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?
penny All right, that’s enough.
amy Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?
penny Yep!
sheldon Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.
penny Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.
sheldon Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
howard Bernie, you okay?
bernadette Yeah, I’ll be right there.
howard Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
bernadette It’s just allergies.
howard Okay.
bernadette Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?
howard Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…
bernadette Ew. Excuse me.
howard Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now.
bernadette Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.
howard You okay?
bernadette A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.
howard Okay.
bernadette Now, kiss me.
howard Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?
bernadette That was amazing. You made me feel things I never…
howard Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.
penny Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?
sheldon Don’t know.
penny I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
sheldon I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
leonard Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.
sheldon Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
penny All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
sheldon All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.
penny Oh, come on, what is that?
sheldon It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?
leonard En el acelerador de particulares.
sheldon Bueno, mi amigo.
penny No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.
sheldon All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.
leonard Just pick another game.
amy Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
leonard No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.
sheldon That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.
amy All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?
sheldon No, that’s not fair either.
penny Why not?
sheldon Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
leonard Yeah, that’s when it started.
sheldon Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out.
penny Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…
amy We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
sheldon No.
leonard Uh-uh.
penny I don’t think so.
amy Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.
howard Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.
mrs_wolowitz Howard? I thought I wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow.
howard Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.
mrs_wolowitz Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I’m not decent.
howard All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?
mans_voice You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?
mrs_wolowitz Shh, you need to whisper.
howard Ma, who is in there?
mrs_wolowitz Uh, nobody. The TV is on.
mans_voice I only got one sock. Where’s my other sock?
howard Who is that?
mrs_wolowitz I told you, it’s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it’s hilarious.
howard If you’re busy, I can come back.
mrs_wolowitz Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.
howard Dr. Schneider?
dr_schneider Oh, hello, Howard.
howard What are you doing here?
dr_schneider Um, house call.
howard You’re a dentist.
dr_schneider Yes, yes, I am. I think he’s on to us.
penny Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.
sheldon Hurry up, find him, find him.
leonard I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.
sheldon For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.
leonard I know what he looks like.
amy Oh, there he is, I got him.
penny Yes, we win again.
sheldon How could you not find him?
leonard Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo.
leonard 57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.
amy Long division, long division. Go, go, go.
leonard Remember, show your work.
sheldon I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.
leonard Get up, we can’t lose at math.
penny 37.
amy Yes.
amy Ready, set, wrestle. One, two, three, pin.
penny Mwah!
sheldon Stop that.
penny Mwah!
sheldon Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.
howard One to beam aboard?
raj Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.
howard Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.
raj Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
howard Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist.
raj Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
howard Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
raj So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
howard It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.
stuart Oh, hey, man, welcome back.
howard Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?
stuart I, I kind of live here now.
raj Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
stuart Ah, he’s spoiling me and I love it.
howard Wow, so you guys are like buds now?
raj Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.
stuart Plus, he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a girlfriend.
raj It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes.
stuart Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.
raj Which part?
stuart Just all of it.
howard Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?
stuart Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.
howard Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool.
raj Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
howard So I’d be sitting by myself?
raj We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
stuart So I, I, I’d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?
howard No, no, you guys go. Have fun.
raj Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?
howard Absolutely. See you, Stuart.
stuart Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?
howard At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
penny All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.
amy On the count of three. One, two…
sheldon Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
leonard So?
sheldon So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?
leonard Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.
sheldon That’s rude.
amy One, two, three, eat.
howard Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space.
all Not now!
sheldon Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!
leonard Snort it down and keep eating!
waitress You look familiar.
howard I don’t think so.
waitress Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You’re an astronaut.
howard Yes. Yes, I am.
waitress Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?
howard Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, I went to my mom…
waitress You want the cheesecake or not?
howard Yes, please. And I think it’s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find I’m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I’m a rocket man. Perfect.
