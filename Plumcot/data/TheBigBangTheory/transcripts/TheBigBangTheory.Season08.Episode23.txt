penny Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.
penny Don’t you want to know for sure?
leonard_hofstadter No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
sheldon_cooper Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
penny Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.
amy_farrah_fowler Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
sheldon_cooper You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.
penny You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.
leonard_hofstadter If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.
penny Really? It didn’t work for you.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you think the moms will get along?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.
sheldon_cooper Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?
mary_cooper Shelly, I’m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you, Mother.
mary_cooper I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
mary_cooper Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.
sheldon_cooper What did they feed the lions, Mother?
mary_cooper The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.
sheldon_cooper Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?
mary_cooper Are you ashamed of me?
sheldon_cooper Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
mary_cooper Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.
dr_beverly_hofstadter So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?
leonard_hofstadter No, we’re kind of taking it slow.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I see.
leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
dr_beverly_hofstadter You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, Mother.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Only satisfactory. I see.
leonard_hofstadter I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.
leonard_hofstadter See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Why? Are you attracted to her, too?
leonard_hofstadter Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Where is she from again?
leonard_hofstadter East Texas.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Ugh.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, look who’s here.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval.
leonard_hofstadter That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.
sheldon_cooper Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.
dr_beverly_hofstadter So nice to meet you.
mary_cooper Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Very pleasant. And yours?
mary_cooper Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.
dr_beverly_hofstadter You’re kidding, right?
leonard_hofstadter Subtle, mom, real subtle.
bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart.
stuart_bloom Morning.
bernadette_rostenkowski We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
mary_cooper You must be very proud of your son.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.
mary_cooper He did?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific.
sheldon_cooper Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
leonard_hofstadter You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?
sheldon_cooper Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.
mary_cooper Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.
sheldon_cooper Ooh, this is a good one.
mary_cooper Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.
sheldon_cooper Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
mary_cooper Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
sheldon_cooper But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.
mary_cooper No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.
mary_cooper Oh, he was a handful.
sheldon_cooper I was a handful.
leonard_hofstadter You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.
dr_beverly_hofstadter All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.
howard_wolowitz I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.
raj_koothrappali We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
stuart_bloom Clearly, you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.
bernadette_rostenkowski Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.
stuart_bloom I put on pants.
howard_wolowitz Kiss-ass.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.
raj_koothrappali Hey, I don’t even live here.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?
raj_koothrappali I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible.
sheldon_cooper Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.
dr_beverly_hofstadter You don’t look very happy.
sheldon_cooper Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
mary_cooper Shelly does not like change.
sheldon_cooper Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
penny Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello. Oh, okay.
penny Sorry, I forgot.
sheldon_cooper You remember my mother.
penny Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.
mary_cooper Good to see you again, dear.
penny Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.
leonard_hofstadter So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.
penny Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.
leonard_hofstadter We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
sheldon_cooper Oh, sure.
leonard_hofstadter It came from Tiffany’s.
sheldon_cooper You mean the box, right?
leonard_hofstadter Keep walking.
penny Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
sheldon_cooper Did I misspeak about the ring?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
sheldon_cooper Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you are a super weaner.
sheldon_cooper Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
sheldon_cooper Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.
penny We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.
mary_cooper It doesn’t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Uch.
mary_cooper Uch? The bible is uch to you?
dr_beverly_hofstadter No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them.
mary_cooper You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?
dr_beverly_hofstadter His name is Sigmund Freud.
penny Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
mary_cooper Stay out of this.
penny Mm-hmm.
mary_cooper At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.
dr_beverly_hofstadter It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?
mary_cooper I know the answer. You’re not gonna like it.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Try me.
mary_cooper When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?
dr_beverly_hofstadter It means, I can’t believe we’re having this conversation.
mary_cooper Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.
penny Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
sheldon_cooper It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.
raj_koothrappali How old is this Jell-O?
stuart_bloom Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very.
howard_wolowitz Sorry we have to do this.
stuart_bloom Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
howard_wolowitz She doesn’t baby me.
stuart_bloom I saw her pull you home in a wagon.
howard_wolowitz For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.
raj_koothrappali Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.
howard_wolowitz You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.
sheldon_cooper Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
dr_beverly_hofstadter But look how well you turned out.
sheldon_cooper I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I suppose.
sheldon_cooper While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?
sheldon_cooper Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?
leonard_hofstadter Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.
mary_cooper Oh, Leonard, I’m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.
penny Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not what it is.
penny I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.
mary_cooper When your mom gets back, I’m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.
penny Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.
mary_cooper Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, me.
penny Yeah, me, too.
mary_cooper Coming up.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t really feel I deserve it.
howard_wolowitz That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.
raj_koothrappali Looks good.
stuart_bloom Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
howard_wolowitz Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.
mary_cooper I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.
mary_cooper And I will pray for you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.
dr_beverly_hofstadter One moment. There’s something I need to say to you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, really? That’s too bad.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child.
sheldon_cooper I taught her that.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. When does that start?
dr_beverly_hofstadter So needy. Come to Mommy.
penny It’s okay, go ahead.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, my son.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my mother.
penny Oh, my God.
stuart_bloom It’s a hard-knock life.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 It’s the hard-knock life for us, it’s the hard-knock life for us. ‘Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‘stead of kisses, we get kicked, it’s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it’s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‘stead of wool, empty bellies ‘stead of full, it’s a hard-knock life.
