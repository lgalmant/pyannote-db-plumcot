penny Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?
leonard Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.
penny Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore.
leonard Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.
penny Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.
leonard Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win.
sheldon Hello.
amy Hi.
penny Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
sheldon Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.
amy It was not a great trip.
penny Well, you’re home now.
sheldon Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?
penny I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
leonard Did you at least have a good flight down there?
sheldon It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.
penny So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?
leonard And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.
sheldon Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…
sheldon How did we get in the car?
leonard Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
amy I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.
amy So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together.
sheldon Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
amy Maybe there won’t be one.
sheldon There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.
amy Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it.
sheldon Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.
penny Do boys have flowers?
leonard Who knows what he has down there.
penny Mm.
sheldon Anyway…
mary Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.
sheldon Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?
mary You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you’re in a church with a guitar.
amy Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.
mary Oh, it’s my pleasure. Mm. I’m so glad y’all could make it. So, tell me, what’s going on back home?
amy Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.
mary Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?
sheldon Welcome to Texas.
amy They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.
sheldon Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.
mary Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.
sheldon All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not.
mary Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.
sheldon What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there.
mary Obviously, I would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I’m very happy for you.
sheldon And what special circumstances are those?
penny Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad.
mary Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.
sheldon What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
mary No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there’d be nurses.
sheldon Well, this is highly insulting.
amy Sheldon, don’t overreact.
sheldon I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.
amy Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
mary Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
penny What?
sheldon Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying.
amy I’ll take over from here.
amy He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
mary He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.
amy Are you going to?
mary Oh, heck no.
amy Sheldon, what, what are you doing?
sheldon Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
mary You startin’ to see why I didn’t go in there? Sheldon, if you’re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain’t changing my mind.
amy We’re ignoring the fins, okay.
sheldon Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too.
amy I don’t think that’s what she’s saying.
sheldon And?
amy That’s exactly what she was saying.
sheldon Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
leonard Absolutely not.
penny That’s too loud.
leonard Absolutely not.
amy Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.
sheldon Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.
amy You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone.
sheldon You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…
amy What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
sheldon I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
amy Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
sheldon I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
amy She was gonna find out eventually.
sheldon Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me.
amy Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.
sheldon Why would you do that?
amy This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
sheldon You managed the situation?
amy That’s right.
sheldon So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life.
amy Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you.
sheldon I have gotten much better at that.
amy Have you? How am I feeling right now?
sheldon What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
amy You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
sheldon How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
amy Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
sheldon Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.
bernadette Hi.
howard Hey, guys.
leonard Hey.
penny Hi. There’s the little family!
raj Hello.
stuart Hello.
leonard And their Sherpas.
penny Mm.
howard The baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?
penny Yeah. Go ahead.
amy Do you need help?
howard No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.
bernadette Sorry we’re late.
penny Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.
sheldon Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up.
sheldon How did we get in the car?
penny Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.
leonard On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.
sheldon I was acting odd intentionally.
bernadette Really? So you can control it?
penny Okay. Then what happened?
sheldon Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. My mother made me take it out. Amy put alcohol on it. And here we are.
howard What did we miss?
bernadette I couldn’t explain it if I tried.
penny So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?
amy Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.
howard So what did you and Leonard do?
penny Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.
leonard It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
raj Oh, my God, what happened?
leonard Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.
bernadette It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks.
stuart I don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.
sheldon I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
penny To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.
howard What happened
penny You do make a cute elf.
leonard Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
penny Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.
leonard Oh cool, I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.
leonard Stupid idea.
penny No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go.
leonard For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!
penny Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens.
leonard You know how easily I blister.
penny Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit.
leonard Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.
penny Fine.
leonard Thank you.
penny Leonard?
leonard Yeah.
penny There’s something on the windshield.
penny You need a break?
leonard Do not need a break.
penny There’s no shame in asking for a break.
leonard If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break.
penny Ugh. Leonard?
leonard Yeah?
penny There’s a tree on you.
leonard You want to decorate it tonight?
penny Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.
leonard I hope it kills us both.
leonard By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.
sheldon So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?
bernadette Sure.
sheldon Hey, how’s life with your baby?
amy Really? You’re never gonna touch their baby?
sheldon To this day I’ve never touched Stuart.
bernadette It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.
bernadette Oh, please stop crying, I’m begging you. I don’t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. Shh. What have we done?
howard Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.
bernadette It took me two hours to get her down.
raj You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always, sometimes we’d leave.
howard Hey, he got her to stop.
bernadette That was so fast.
raj Oh, he’s really good with her.
bernadette Yeah, he has a gift.
howard What’s the matter?
bernadette Nothing, these are happy tears.
howard Oh, good.
bernadette No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?
howard I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away.
bernadette Not funny.
raj She’s tired, that was funny.
bernadette Everyone’s a better mom than me.
raj Oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk.
sheldon Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?
amy Sheldon.
sheldon What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
leonard Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
stuart Oh, I just talked to her. I’ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.
penny You poor things you must be exhausted.
howard It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
bernadette How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
howard She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that.
bernadette Now you hate me too.
howard Shh, I don’t hate you.
sheldon It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.
bernadette Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now.
sheldon Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
penny So things started to turn around?
bernadette Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
leonard Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice.
howard Bernie?
bernadette Shh. She’s asleep.
howard Great. And where are you?
bernadette Down here.
howard Oh. This is new.
bernadette I didn’t know what else to do. It worked.
howard Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on.
bernadette Don’t make me laugh.
howard Do you need help getting out?
bernadette I think I live here now. It’s fine.
howard Is it okay if I get some sleep?
bernadette Yeah, go ahead.
howard Good job, Mommy. I’m proud of you.
bernadette Don’t make me cry, either.
howard Good night. I love both my girls.
bernadette We love you, too.
penny I can’t believe you fit in the crib.
bernadette I could take a bath in the sink. I don’t, but I can.
raj So how were your holidays?
stuart Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She’s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go… oh come on.
amy That was fun, thank you.
bernadette Yeah, thanks.
penny Our pleasure.
leonard See you guys at work.
raj Be there bright and early.
howard Not me, paternity leave.
sheldon Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
howard With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this.
