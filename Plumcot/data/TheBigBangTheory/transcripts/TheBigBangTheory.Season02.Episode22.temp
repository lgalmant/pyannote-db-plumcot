sheldon Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!
howard They’re on me today, boys.
raj You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
howard No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
raj Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.
leonard Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
howard Is that supposed to be funny?
sheldon I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
howard Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
raj He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.
sheldon Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
stuart Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s mind-blowing.
sheldon Excuse me, spoiler alert.
stuart I didn’t spoil anything.
sheldon You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
stuart I’m sorry.
sheldon Said the Grinch to Christmas.
stuart Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?
leonard Oh, sure, what’s up?
stuart Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?
leonard Yeah, vaguely.
raj Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
leonard What about it?
stuart Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that well.
leonard Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
stuart I can’t do that.
leonard Why the hell not?
stuart ‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.
sheldon Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?
stuart No.
sheldon Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.
stuart Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up.
leonard Nobody wants that.
stuart So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical?
leonard Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
stuart Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?
leonard Yeah, or you call me.
stuart Great.
leonard Or nobody calls anyone.
raj Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
leonard You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
howard Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
leonard I’m listening.
howard Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
penny Hey, Leonard.
leonard Oh, hi.
penny How’s it going?
leonard Good, good. You?
penny Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?
leonard Sure.
penny You know your friend Stuart?
leonard Yes.
penny Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
leonard About what?
penny Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
leonard No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.
penny Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.
leonard Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!
penny Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
leonard About Stuart? Love to.
penny He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
leonard Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.
penny Really?
leonard Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.
leonard Oh. It’s Stuart.
sheldon You’re not going to answer it?
leonard He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
sheldon You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.
leonard Why would he call me?
sheldon We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know.
leonard I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon.
sheldon Answer the phone, Leonard.
leonard No! There, it went to voice mail.
sheldon Aren’t you going to check your messages?
leonard No.
sheldon You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
leonard It must be hell inside your head.
sheldon At times.
howard Guys, we have a code red.
sheldon Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
howard Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
leonard How teeny tiny?
howard It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
sheldon But the mission is for six months.
howard Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
sheldon Have you notified NASA?
howard No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
leonard Well, what are you gonna do?
howard I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them.
leonard So, what do you need us for?
raj He can’t figure out how to fix it.
howard Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.
raj I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
sheldon I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
howard All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
raj Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
leonard Good one.
raj Yeah.
howard Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
raj You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
sheldon Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
stuart Hey Leonard.
leonard Hey Stuart.
stuart You busy?
leonard Um…
howard Classified, Leonard.
leonard Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?
stuart Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…
leonard Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.
stuart Or e-mail.
leonard Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.
stuart Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
leonard All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
stuart Okay.
leonard You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.
stuart Fear?
leonard Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break.
stuart Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
leonard Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.
stuart Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?
howard You don’t know what this is?
stuart No.
howard Good. Get out.
raj Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.
leonard It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
sheldon For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
sheldon All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?
howard No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
leonard I feel terrible.
howard Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.
leonard I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
raj Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
sheldon You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?
raj It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.
howard Speaking of what goes around comes around…
raj Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
sheldon It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
raj What if we reposition the collection tank?
sheldon It won’t work. No way to mount it.
howard Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
sheldon That could work.
leonard Morning.
penny Morning. What’s up?
leonard Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
penny Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
leonard Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
penny I really don’t want to talk about it.
leonard Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…
penny I said I don’t want to talk about it.
leonard Okay… I just… I kind of…
penny Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?
raj If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte.
howard Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
sheldon You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
howard Sheldon, I know what I’m doing.
sheldon If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
raj Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
howard Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
raj That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
howard Where are you going?
leonard Comic book store.
sheldon Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.
raj Me, too.
howard Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
sheldon Why does Leonard get to go?
leonard ‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries.
leonard Thanks for understanding, Howard.
howard I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.
raj Wow, that’s heavy.
howard Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations.
sheldon I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.
howard Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one.
sheldon Fascinating.
raj What do you think the problem is?
howard Not enough bread crumbs.
leonard Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
stuart Sure, what’s up?
leonard I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.
stuart No, your advice was great.
leonard It was?
stuart Yeah, going slow really worked.
leonard You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
stuart Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
leonard Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
stuart It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell.
leonard During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
stuart No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.
leonard Leonard?
stuart That is your name, right?
leonard Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.
stuart Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.
leonard No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out.
stuart Not your fault.
leonard Yeah, how about that? See you soon.
stuart Yeah, sure.
howard Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.
penny What’s classified?
leonard Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
howard Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works.
sheldon I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true.
penny Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
leonard I’m sorry, were you talking to me?
penny Yeah, I said Leonard.
leonard Yes, you did, didn’t you?
penny What the hell is that?
howard Meatloaf.
leonard What was it doing on the ceiling?
howard That’s classified.
voice Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We’d like to make an unscheduled space walk.
houston ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
iss_voice Houston, we’d all like to step outside for a few minutes.
houston ISS, I’m afraid we can’t authorize that.
iss_voice Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.
