howard_wolowitz Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.
sheldon_cooper Stop. We can’t do this, it’s not right.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
sheldon_cooper But once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. We’ll just erase the first season of Battlestar.
sheldon_cooper There. We’re outlaws.
penny Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?
leonard_hofstadter It’s perfect.
howard_wolowitz For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.
penny Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
sheldon_cooper I understand your envy. This is a can’t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.
penny When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.
leonard_hofstadter This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
penny Oh, my God, the George Smoot?
leonard_hofstadter You’ve heard of him?
penny Of course I haven’t.
sheldon_cooper George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.
penny It’s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.
sheldon_cooper It’s like talking to a chimp.
penny Okay, now that I’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I wish.
sheldon_cooper We’re not flying, we’re taking the train.
penny Oh, cool.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.
penny Well, then why are you doing it?
leonard_hofstadter Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I always enjoy that, but I’m a little busy.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.
leonard_hofstadter Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?
sheldon_cooper Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
sheldon_cooper I don’t follow.
leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t expect you to. I’ll see you later.
sheldon_cooper Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.
sheldon_cooper What on earth are you doing?
raj_koothrappali Whatever it is, I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Raj.
raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
sheldon_cooper That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
sheldon_cooper Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco.
raj_koothrappali It’s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
sheldon_cooper He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways’ magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale.
raj_koothrappali Holy crap! Look!
leonard_hofstadter Is that who I think it is?
howard_wolowitz It can’t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe John Connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil Terminator.
sheldon_cooper Unlikely. That’s a television show, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot! Ahh!
leonard_hofstadter At least he’s off the train crap.
sheldon_cooper Whee!
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I’ve actually got a shot at a Terminator.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you’ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
howard_wolowitz You’re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter My money’s on tuck and roll.
sheldon_cooper I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
sheldon_cooper All right.
howard_wolowitz That’s Summer Glau.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
howard_wolowitz That’s it.
raj_koothrappali Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
howard_wolowitz Um, well, let’s see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.
raj_koothrappali No, you didn’t. I did.
howard_wolowitz Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I’m sober.
raj_koothrappali You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.
howard_wolowitz Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but what about me? Why don’t I get a shot?
howard_wolowitz Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.
leonard_hofstadter You know, I’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can’t score with. I think I’ll let you two take this one.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
sheldon_cooper Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…
raj_koothrappali Yeah-yeah, which way?
sheldon_cooper and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as Portland.
leonard_hofstadter So aren’t you going to go talk to her?
howard_wolowitz I will, I’m just working on my opening line.
leonard_hofstadter She’s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?
howard_wolowitz No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that’s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.
leonard_hofstadter You’re going to need more than 11 hours.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the matter?
sheldon_cooper I forgot my flash drive.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So we have to go back.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Sheldon, I’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.
sheldon_cooper You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
leonard_hofstadter Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
sheldon_cooper It’s brilliant. He needs to read it.
leonard_hofstadter So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
sheldon_cooper Then I won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Of course.
sheldon_cooper Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.
leonard_hofstadter Well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
sheldon_cooper You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive
leonard_hofstadter Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.
howard_wolowitz It’s hot in here. Must be Summer. So, where you gals headed?
sheldon_cooper Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve got a better idea.
sheldon_cooper Are you going to be sarcastic?
leonard_hofstadter Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.But look, Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
sheldon_cooper But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper The key is hidden in my room.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper Penny would have to go into my room.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper People don’t go in my room!
leonard_hofstadter I see. Well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I hate when that happens.
howard_wolowitz It’s hot in here. It must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
raj_koothrappali It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
summer_glau That’s cute.
raj_koothrappali Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
summer_glau Oh, yeah, I loved it.
raj_koothrappali It’s loosely based on my life.
penny Yeah, we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on. Hello?
sheldon_cooper Listen carefully. I’m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.
penny Just a sec. The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it’s a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I’ll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I’ll see you then. Hello?
sheldon_cooper Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?
penny Your dresser? Who is this?
sheldon_cooper It’s Sheldon.
penny Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?
sheldon_cooper I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?
penny Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what’s up?
sheldon_cooper What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…
leonard_hofstadter Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It’s Leonard.
penny Hey, Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?
leonard_hofstadter He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.
penny Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
sheldon_cooper No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.
raj_koothrappali And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s Venus.
summer_glau That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.
raj_koothrappali Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.
summer_glau You’re not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?
raj_koothrappali You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he’s one of those geeks.
sheldon_cooper All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right
howard_wolowitz Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he’s M. Night Charmalarmalon.
leonard_hofstadter Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.
howard_wolowitz What?
leonard_hofstadter Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
howard_wolowitz What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.
howard_wolowitz Placebo, you say. Interesting.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.
raj_koothrappali Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.
summer_glau You’re making that up.
raj_koothrappali You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
howard_wolowitz Raj.
raj_koothrappali Yes?
howard_wolowitz Look.
raj_koothrappali What am I looking at?
howard_wolowitz You tell me.
raj_koothrappali Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh
howard_wolowitz Hi, I’m the small package good things come in.
penny Okay, I got a box, but there’s no key in here. Just letters.
sheldon_cooper That’s the wrong box. Put it back.
penny Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?
sheldon_cooper Don’t read those letters!
penny Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
sheldon_cooper Put down the letters!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. It’s Leonard.
penny Hey, Leonard. How’s the train ride?
leonard_hofstadter Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth.
penny Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper I’m back.
penny What up, Moon Pie?
sheldon_cooper Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. Leonard again.
howard_wolowitz So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?
summer_glau I really don’t know.
howard_wolowitz I’ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
summer_glau Is that so?
howard_wolowitz And did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?
summer_glau No. I didn’t.
penny Okay, I found the box. Now what?
sheldon_cooper You’re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You’ll hear a slight click.
penny Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
sheldon_cooper No, it’s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?
penny Not yet. There it is.
howard_wolowitz Okay, here’s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you’d be Summer Winter.
summer_glau Uh-huh.
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m going to just go for broke here and say I like you.
summer_glau Yeah?
howard_wolowitz So here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you’d say yes?
summer_glau No.
howard_wolowitz Fair enough. I’ll leave you in peace.
summer_glau Thank you.
howard_wolowitz But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?
summer_glau Sure.
howard_wolowitz Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we’re making out?
sheldon_cooper Okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’d it go?
howard_wolowitz Terminator broke my phone.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…
summer_glau I’m sorry. This is me.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, my name’s Leonard.
sheldon_cooper So, I’m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you’ll be back on top.
dr_george_smoot With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?
sheldon_cooper Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.
