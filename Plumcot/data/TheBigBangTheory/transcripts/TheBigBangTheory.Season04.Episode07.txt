leonard_hofstadter No, seriously, I think I’ve finally figured out my problem with women.
sheldon_cooper The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
leonard_hofstadter What does that have to do with me and women?
sheldon_cooper Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
leonard_hofstadter My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah? What’s that look like?
leonard_hofstadter Hi. I’m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
raj_koothrappali Where are we going?
howard_wolowitz Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. If we’re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.
leonard_hofstadter Congratulations Howard.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.
raj_koothrappali Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don’t want to speak to the FBI.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
raj_koothrappali I’m brown and I talk funny.
howard_wolowitz They’re just doing a background check on me.
raj_koothrappali It doesn’t matter. They’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it’s not offensive.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t be ridiculous, Raj. You’re here legally.
raj_koothrappali Nobody cares. Do you know how long it’s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
sheldon_cooper You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.
sheldon_cooper No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Bella, don’t you see? Edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you. Coming.
woman_at_door#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Koothrappali? I’m Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in? I’d like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz. Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?
raj_koothrappali Rum cake?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.
raj_koothrappali Seven years.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I see.
raj_koothrappali I’m in this country legally, you know.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?
raj_koothrappali Of course not. I’m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I’m not.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?
raj_koothrappali No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Excuse me?
raj_koothrappali Please don’t send me back to India, it’s so crowded. It’s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody’s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Koothrappali, I’m not…
raj_koothrappali I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I’m a real Yankee Doodle boy!
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Koothrappali, please.
raj_koothrappali My country ’tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It’s really great.
leonard_hofstadter So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Who?
leonard_hofstadter Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?
leonard_hofstadter Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?
leonard_hofstadter You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Sounds great.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?
leonard_hofstadter Is that, oh, my, I didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I’m starting to exude.
leonard_hofstadter Want to get that?
sheldon_cooper Not particularly.
leonard_hofstadter Could you get that?
sheldon_cooper I suppose I could if I were asked.
leonard_hofstadter Would you please get that?
sheldon_cooper Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Cooper?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m Special Agent Page, FBI.
sheldon_cooper You say you’re Special Agent Page, FBI.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Here’s my I.D.
sheldon_cooper And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn’t prove I know Batman.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.
sheldon_cooper Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you.
sheldon_cooper For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Fidelity, bravery, integrity?
sheldon_cooper Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven’t I heard back yet?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.
sheldon_cooper That’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?
sheldon_cooper A little, but go on.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
sheldon_cooper I’m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.Mr Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 That’s really not the sort of thing we’re interested in.
sheldon_cooper You heard me say blu-ray, right?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I did.
sheldon_cooper Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m afraid not. Is there anything else?
sheldon_cooper Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that’s not irresponsible, I don’t know what is.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 The Mars Rover?
sheldon_cooper Did I say Mars Rover?
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 You did.
sheldon_cooper That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Yes, well, let’s talk about it anyway.
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.
howard_wolowitz Hey, buddies. Guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?
leonard_hofstadter What happened?
howard_wolowitz Apparently, the background interviews didn’t go well. You guys wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?
raj_koothrappali Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.
leonard_hofstadter And I may have hit on her a little bit.
raj_koothrappali I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
howard_wolowitz I see. Well, it’s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.
leonard_hofstadter I feel awful.
raj_koothrappali Ah, me, too.
leonard_hofstadter To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing up?
sheldon_cooper Sleep eludes me, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
sheldon_cooper Mockery? That’s all you have to offer?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?
sheldon_cooper Who knows? I haven’t watched any scary movies recently. I’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it’s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
leonard_hofstadter Did something happen today that’s bothering you?
sheldon_cooper Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper But why should that keep me up?
leonard_hofstadter Because you feel guilty?
sheldon_cooper Interesting. So you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, you don’t have insomnia. You’re sleeping now.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me?
leonard_hofstadter You’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
sheldon_cooper Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
leonard_hofstadter How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
sheldon_cooper That seems fairly conclusive. No, Gorn, no. That’s where I sit.
sheldon_cooper Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Was your statement untrue?
sheldon_cooper No.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Then I’m afraid you can’t withdraw it.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I don’t recall you saying no backsies.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Is there anything else?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I’d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard’s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O’s for outstanding, which he is such. W’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. A’s for artistic, his ability…
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.
sheldon_cooper But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 It’s closed.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.
page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 This is Leonard Hofstadter?
sheldon_cooper No, it’s a different Leonard. He’s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.
sheldon_cooper Raj. Have you seen Howard?
raj_koothrappali I think he’s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.
sheldon_cooper I’m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He’s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
neil_degrasse_tyson But I actually didn’t demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.
sheldon_cooper If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.
neil_degrasse_tyson Is that the guy you were telling me about?
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
howard_wolowitz You?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.
howard_wolowitz And they were okay with that?
sheldon_cooper No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I’m here now to say I’m sorry.
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding me? You’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.
howard_wolowitz Your apology is not accepted.
sheldon_cooper You’re tricking me. It really is, isn’t it?
howard_wolowitz Leave me alone, Sheldon.
neil_degrasse_tyson Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I’m sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.
sheldon_cooper Oh, shut up.
penny Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper I have troubles, Penny. I’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.
penny You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.
sheldon_cooper I don’t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
penny Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?
sheldon_cooper Alcohol.
penny Could you be a little more specific?
sheldon_cooper Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
penny I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know millilitres.
sheldon_cooper Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
penny Would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?
sheldon_cooper More or less.
penny Great. Now, where were we?
sheldon_cooper I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. Let’s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I’ll have a Rosewater Ricky.
penny A what?
sheldon_cooper You’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…
penny Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
sheldon_cooper That’s not how it looks in the picture.
penny Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don’t you give it a try.
sheldon_cooper All right. To the metric system. I can’t taste the cherries.
penny All right. Sheldon, what’s on your mind?
sheldon_cooper I wronged Howard, and he won’t accept my apology.
penny Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.
sheldon_cooper Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?
penny I drink.
sheldon_cooper To drinking. Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.
penny You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend.
sheldon_cooper I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.
penny Exactly. Sometimes you can’t win.
sheldon_cooper Captain Kirk won.
penny Kirk cheated.
sheldon_cooper Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.
penny Right there with you.
sheldon_cooper Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That’s it.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I’ll reprogram Howard.
penny What? Sheldon, you can’t reprogram people.
sheldon_cooper No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk.
sheldon_cooper Hello, all.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?
howard_wolowitz Not really.
sheldon_cooper Yes, you are. I’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Go away, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper There’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
raj_koothrappali What’s in the bag?
sheldon_cooper It’s for Howard.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts.
sheldon_cooper Nevertheless, I’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.
howard_wolowitz You’re giving me a couch cushion?
sheldon_cooper No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.
howard_wolowitz But you love that spot.
sheldon_cooper No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it’s yours.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.
howard_wolowitz All right. Apology accepted.
sheldon_cooper High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
raj_koothrappali I haven’t cried like this since Toy Story 3.
howard_wolowitz I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…
sheldon_cooper I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
penny How long?
leonard_hofstadter 94 seconds.
