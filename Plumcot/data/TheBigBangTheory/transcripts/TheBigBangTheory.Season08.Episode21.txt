sheldon_cooper Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?
howard_wolowitz Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.
sheldon_cooper There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…
leonard_hofstadter Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.
leonard_hofstadter That’s pretty cool, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.
raj_koothrappali Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
raj_koothrappali You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
raj_koothrappali Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.
sheldon_cooper All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.
raj_koothrappali Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
sheldon_cooper Excellent.
howard_wolowitz Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Congratulations.
raj_koothrappali And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.
sheldon_cooper Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?
raj_koothrappali Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.
leonard_hofstadter My mommy raised a gentleman.
raj_koothrappali Hey. Thanks for coming by.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. I’m excited to help.
raj_koothrappali I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.
leonard_hofstadter I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.
raj_koothrappali You should have told him to mind his own business.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.
raj_koothrappali What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
leonard_hofstadter Mmm, they’re alpha males.
raj_koothrappali Huh, what does that make us?
leonard_hofstadter We could be betas. They’re second in charge.
raj_koothrappali Okay, that sounds good.
leonard_hofstadter Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
raj_koothrappali Okay, that sounds like us.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. How do you want to start?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
raj_koothrappali No. We can do this by ourselves.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. How do you want to start?
penny Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.
penny Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.
sheldon_cooper I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali.
penny Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.
sheldon_cooper How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.
penny No, no. It’s about my acting career.
sheldon_cooper Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list.
penny Well.
sheldon_cooper Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.
penny Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.
penny Well, why?
sheldon_cooper I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.
penny You’re really not gonna tell me?
sheldon_cooper No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s going on in here?
howard_wolowitz I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. How do you drink it?
howard_wolowitz Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think I’ll have a beer.
howard_wolowitz First take a picture with me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why?
howard_wolowitz Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.
bernadette_rostenkowski Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?
howard_wolowitz You betcha. The very one.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together.
howard_wolowitz I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.
howard_wolowitz With my honeybunch.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re being childish.
howard_wolowitz No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry. What do we know?
howard_wolowitz In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?
howard_wolowitz You don’t think I’m a leader?
bernadette_rostenkowski I was kidding. Of course you are.
howard_wolowitz Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.
bernadette_rostenkowski You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?
howard_wolowitz All by myself.
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s my big boss man.
sheldon_cooper So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.
penny Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.
sheldon_cooper Mmm.
penny If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?
sheldon_cooper Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
penny No.
sheldon_cooper All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.
penny Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
sheldon_cooper Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?
penny Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.
penny I’m sorry. What was I thinking?
sheldon_cooper Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?
penny ‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it.
sheldon_cooper Ah, it’s just like he’s here.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.
leonard_hofstadter Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.
raj_koothrappali Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
leonard_hofstadter That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
raj_koothrappali Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.
leonard_hofstadter My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.
raj_koothrappali And he’s all white.
leonard_hofstadter They zip him up in that bag.
raj_koothrappali And Gertie can’t stop crying.
leonard_hofstadter The flower dies.
raj_koothrappali Okay, let’s talk about something else.
leonard_hofstadter All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.
raj_koothrappali And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
leonard_hofstadter It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.
raj_koothrappali Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.
leonard_hofstadter That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
raj_koothrappali Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
raj_koothrappali Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.
leonard_hofstadter The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
raj_koothrappali Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
leonard_hofstadter All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
raj_koothrappali We, we can totally do that.
leonard_hofstadter I know.
raj_koothrappali This is great.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you know what else it is?
raj_koothrappali What?
howard_wolowitz Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
raj_koothrappali Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.
sheldon_cooper It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.
howard_wolowitz Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?
sheldon_cooper You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
howard_wolowitz Hello.
raj_koothrappali Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.
howard_wolowitz Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
leonard_hofstadter We want you back on the project with us.
sheldon_cooper Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?
raj_koothrappali Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help.
howard_wolowitz I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
raj_koothrappali It wasn’t, so are you in?
sheldon_cooper Certainly.
howard_wolowitz Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.
sheldon_cooper Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I think we should do it right now.
sheldon_cooper Tonight works better for me.
raj_koothrappali Okay.
penny Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? I’m starting to remember.
raj_koothrappali So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.
sheldon_cooper Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.
leonard_hofstadter How is that building on what he just said?
howard_wolowitz Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.
raj_koothrappali Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.
sheldon_cooper Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.
leonard_hofstadter Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant.
howard_wolowitz I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
sheldon_cooper Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not Simon Says.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 Penny?
penny Oh, hey.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 Hey. I haven’t seen you auditioning in a while.
penny Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 You quit acting?
penny Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.
second_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 I heard you can make good money doing that.
penny Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.
first_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 Really?
penny Mmm.
first_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 ‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.
audition_girl Chelsea?
first_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 Wish me luck.
second_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 They’re gonna love you. I heard she’s pushing 40 and everything’s fake.
penny Yeah. I started that rumour.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.
raj_koothrappali Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.
howard_wolowitz The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.
leonard_hofstadter Squeeze yourself.
sheldon_cooper Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.
raj_koothrappali Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.
howard_wolowitz You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.
raj_koothrappali Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
sheldon_cooper Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.
raj_koothrappali Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.
howard_wolowitz It’s not always.
leonard_hofstadter What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.
sheldon_cooper We looked great.
leonard_hofstadter You let a guy sit on me.
howard_wolowitz He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.
leonard_hofstadter I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.
howard_wolowitz You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.
howard_wolowitz Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
sheldon_cooper I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?
raj_koothrappali He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge.
sheldon_cooper No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?
penny I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
penny I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.
penny I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard.
penny Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.
penny Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.
penny Okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski How about now?
penny All right.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t forget your wallet.
penny I, uh, huh.
sheldon_cooper Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it.
alien That soft pink alien looks delicious.
alien_2 I could eat.
