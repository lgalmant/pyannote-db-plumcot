sheldon Oh, boy.
leonard What?
sheldon I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
leonard Then what was oh, boy?
sheldon Great restraint on my part.
leonard There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
sheldon Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
leonard Okay, how’s that?
sheldon You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
leonard Why?
sheldon It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
leonard Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning.
sheldon That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
leonard Yeah, I know the feeling.
sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning.
sheldon Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
leonard Everybody?
sheldon You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.
leonard You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
sheldon He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.
leonard You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to.
sheldon Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
leonard Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
sheldon Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.
leonard Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
sheldon Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”
leonard Okay, well, do you want to go?
sheldon Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
leonard Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
sheldon Sarcasm?
leonard Maybe.
sheldon I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?
leonard Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now.
sheldon I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go.
leonard Well, then don’t go.
sheldon How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
leonard All right, then go.
sheldon Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
leonard Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
sheldon Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.
leonard How was it resolved?
sheldon It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
howard Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon.
raj We could play outside.
howard We could sit on the left side of the couch.
leonard I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
raj Our dreams are very small, aren’t they?
sheldon Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…
all Yeah! Woo-hoo!
sheldon …the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
leonard It’s not gonna be the same without you.
howard Godspeed.
sheldon Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.
raj Ooh, I don’t like where this is going.
sheldon I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
howard To the North Pole?
sheldon Yes.
raj Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
sheldon I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.
howard Really?
sheldon Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?
howard We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
sheldon I’m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
howard We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
leonard Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
howard Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”
raj But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.
leonard Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
howard I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
raj You still might get on a magazine.
howard So you guys are seriously considering this?
leonard Yes.
howard And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
raj Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
sheldon Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?
leonard I’m in.
raj Me, too.
howard Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.
sheldon Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing.
sheldon Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon Penny.
penny What do you want?
sheldon I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
penny Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
sheldon No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
penny What?
sheldon I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
penny You’re all going?
sheldon Yes.
penny For three months?
sheldon Yes.
penny Excuse me.
sheldon Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
penny Hey, Leonard.
leonard Hi.
penny Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.
leonard Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?
penny Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
leonard Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
penny Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
sheldon Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?
penny Is he serious?
leonard Actually, it would help.
penny All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
leonard Yeah.
sheldon I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?
penny Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.
leonard Did she seem upset to you?
sheldon No. Did she seem upset to you?
leonard No.
sheldon Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?
leonard A little bit.
sheldon Two for two. I’m on fire.
leonard I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?
sheldon That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time.
sheldon Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.
raj Where are your tools?
sheldon Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.
howard For this I went to MIT.
sheldon And begin.
raj I think I swallowed some paint!
leonard I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!
sheldon Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
howard Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.
leonard Okay, I can’t do this.
raj Me either.
sheldon Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
howard You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.
leonard Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
sheldon I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
sheldon Here, drink slash eat this.
leonard What is it?
sheldon It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
howard Okay, why?
sheldon Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.
leonard Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant.
sheldon Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick.
raj But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.
mrs_koothrappali I don’t care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?
raj If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.
dr_koothrappali Don’t talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.
raj No, it’s not. Howard, tell them.
howard Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.
mrs_koothrappali So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?
sheldon That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.
howard Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?
howards_mother Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!
howard I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!
howards_mother He doesn’t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he’s ashamed!
penny Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?
leonard Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?
penny Well, I got you a little going away present.
leonard Oh, a blanket.
penny Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah! So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.
leonard Oh, wow, cool.
penny Oh, I’m gonna miss you. See you later.
leonard Bye.
mrs_koothrappali I told you no. Why don’t you believe me?
howards_mother ‘Cause it doesn’t make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn’t one Outback Steakhouse?!
leonard Sheldon, Sheldon?
sheldon I want a cookie, Meemaw.
leonard Sheldon, it’s me.
sheldon But Meemaw just made cookies.
leonard Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition.
sheldon What?
leonard I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
sheldon Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.
leonard Yeah, that’s very comforting.
sheldon Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
leonard Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go.
sheldon Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?
leonard Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
sheldon What is it?
leonard It’s a blanket with sleeves.
sheldon Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?
leonard Yes, obviously.
sheldon All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.
leonard Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?
sheldon She does have a short attention span.
leonard So, I can’t go.
sheldon Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
leonard You really think so?
sheldon Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!
penny Oh, Leonard, what time is it?
leonard It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.
penny Okay.
leonard What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
penny Um, I don’t know. You’ll be gone and I’ll notice.
leonard Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?
penny Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
leonard All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
penny That wasn’t a long hug.
leonard It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
penny Leonard, I don’t know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
leonard Glad we cleared that up.
penny Yeah.
leonard I guess I’ll see you.
penny Okay, have a safe trip.
leonard Thank you. Bye.
penny Okay, bye. Means I wish you weren’t going.
leonard Damn it.
howard What?
leonard We’re out of ice.
sheldon All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.
raj What are you working on?
howard Crossbow.
leonard Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.
raj He’s right.
howard Yeah, wow.
sheldon It is remarkable.
raj So, who’s up for a movie?
howard Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter’s The Thing?
raj I say double feature.
leonard Dinner’s ready!
sheldon What are we having?
leonard Reconstituted Thai food.
sheldon Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
leonard Check.
sheldon Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
leonard Check.
sheldon Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?
leonard Uh, oh, sorry.
sheldon Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
howard There’s no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
sheldon Three months. This is gonna be great!
