amy_farrah_fowler So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject.
leonard_hofstadter Way to narrow it down to everything.
sheldon_cooper What is it?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?
penny W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?
leonard_hofstadter Well, where’s that information been this whole time?
penny Well, where is he?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon?
leonard_hofstadter I’ll check his room.
sheldon_cooper Surprise.
penny Oh, my God.
sheldon_cooper Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry I brought it up.
penny Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?
sheldon_cooper Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink.
amy_farrah_fowler But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.
leonard_hofstadter One day. Right.
amy_farrah_fowler Can you please just tell me why?
sheldon_cooper Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.
penny Oh, poor thing.
sheldon_cooper When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.
amy_farrah_fowler You realize none of those things would happen now?
sheldon_cooper I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.
penny You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.
leonard_hofstadter And we live here, so we have no choice.
penny Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.
howard_wolowitz You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his birthday?
raj_koothrappali He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
leonard_hofstadter Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.
howard_wolowitz That’s funny. Let’s do that.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
raj_koothrappali You mean, some guy in a lame suit?
leonard_hofstadter Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?
stuart_bloom Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him.
leonard_hofstadter Can I get his contact info?
stuart_bloom Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva.
leonard_hofstadter He is?
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. Won’t take the bus. He won’t pack his own lunch. Won’t let you spend the night on his couch.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?
sheldon_cooper Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.
penny All right, what about music?
sheldon_cooper I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
penny No music it is.
bernadette_rostenkowski What kind of cake do you like?
sheldon_cooper Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.
raj_koothrappali Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.
raj_koothrappali You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.
howard_wolowitz Don’t say that to him.
raj_koothrappali What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t say that to anyone.
penny Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don’t always feel like I’m part of the group.
penny Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?
barry_kripke Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, no, no. Come on in.
barry_kripke And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?
bernadette_rostenkowski Doing great.
stuart_bloom You, you’re pregnant?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
stuart_bloom Sounds like something a member of the group might know.
penny Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.
leonard_hofstadter Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?
adam_west Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
adam_west Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.
howard_wolowitz Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman.
adam_west I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale.
adam_west There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.
howard_wolowitz Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, of course.
adam_west What’s an Affleck?
sheldon_cooper Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.
sheldon_cooper But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.
sheldon_cooper But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
leonard_hofstadter So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. You had a party for your 60th?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.
penny You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.
dr_beverly_hofstadter And I never did thank you for that, dear.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?
sheldon_cooper I am. Oh. Wait.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you all right?
sheldon_cooper No, I just, I got a little light-headed.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, do you need a minute?
sheldon_cooper No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.
all@ Happy birthday!
leonard_hofstadter Speech! Speech!
raj_koothrappali Come on, Sheldon, say something.
sheldon_cooper Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.
leonard_hofstadter Batman finally came to your party.
adam_west Happy birthday, Sherman.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
adam_west I still get paid, don’t I?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?
leonard_hofstadter No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on.
leonard_hofstadter Again, no offence, but so have I.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, he’s seen me without pants on.
leonard_hofstadter Again, no…
penny Okay, this is ridiculous. Sheldon? Can I come in?
sheldon_cooper How do you know I’m not using the facilities?
penny Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.
penny I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
sheldon_cooper I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.
penny Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think I can go back out there.
penny That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.
sheldon_cooper Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it.
penny My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.
sheldon_cooper Well, everyone will think I’m weird.
penny Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much.
barry_kripke Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard’s mother.
leslie_winkle Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
leslie_winkle It’s been a while.
leonard_hofstadter Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
leslie_winkle Has it?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.
leslie_winkle Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you’d be living with Sheldon forever.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger.
penny Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?
barry_kripke What are you wooking at me for? I’m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.
sheldon_cooper Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.
amy_farrah_fowler If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.
sheldon_cooper Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…
sheldon_cooper Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.
sheldon_cooper Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.
wil_wheaton Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.
sheldon_cooper That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can’t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.
barry_kripke Someone caw Animal Contwol. There’s a cougar on the woose.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Barry, stop.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously, Barry, stop.
raj_koothrappali And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
sheldon_cooper And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
leslie_winkle Uh, in the past, I would’ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I’m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it’s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.
leslie_winkle Happy birthday, dumbass.
adam_west Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.
howard_wolowitz What? You gotta be kidding me?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Happy birthday, buddy.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. That, that was wonderful.
penny Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.
stuart_bloom Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I’ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, everybody, listen up.
penny You nailed it.
amy_farrah_fowler We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
stephen_hawking Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking.
stephen_hawking Happy birthday to you.
sheldon_cooper Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…
stephen_hawking Happy birthday to you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry.
stephen_hawking Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.
stephen_hawking I was crushing it, but all right.
penny Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
sheldon_cooper You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating.
leonard_hofstadter Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.
stephen_hawking And a one, and a two…
all@ Happy birthday to you,
adam_west So, who’s taking me home?
