penny Whatcha doing?
sheldon I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
penny Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?
sheldon Is it morning?
penny Yes.
sheldon Then I’ve been up all night.
penny And you’re stuck?
sheldon Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
penny Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.
leonard Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
penny What is he doing now?
leonard Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
sheldon Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
leonard Aye, aye, Captain.
sheldon I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
leonard Maybe you need a fresh start.
sheldon You’re right. It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
sheldon Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…
howard How long has he been stuck?
leonard Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
sheldon Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
howard Have you tried rebooting him?
leonard No, I think it’s a firmware problem.
raj Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?
howard Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating.
leonard I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
howard What could be better? We’re in.
raj Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
howard You can come with us.
raj No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com.
sheldon Structure, constant structure. One atom…
howard Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?
leonard Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
howard I thought I smelled popcorn.
sheldon Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…
leonard I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
raj Hey, those are my lima beans!
sheldon Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
raj But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie.
leonard Here, you want my peas?
sheldon Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.
howard Want my corn?
sheldon Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
leonard So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?
howard Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.
leonard Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?
howard Not this time, I promise.
raj Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
sheldon The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
raj Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
bernadette Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?
penny Not recently.
bernadette I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.
penny For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
leonard You had some nice moves out there, Howard.
howard Thanks. You, too.
leonard Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
howard Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
bernadette When Howard tried to do the splits…
penny Shh.
leonard Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
penny Oh, poor baby.
leonard Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
penny Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.
leonard Oh, my God! Are you…
sheldon Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
penny Oh, damn.
leonard Are you okay?
penny Do I look okay?
leonard Don’t bark at me. I fell, too.
penny Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.
howard Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
sheldon The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
bernadette With marbles?
sheldon Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?
bernadette Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
sheldon I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
penny Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
leonard No, that’s a crazy thing.
bernadette Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?
sheldon They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
bernadette Which leads to…?
sheldon Impaired cognitive function.
bernadette Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
sheldon But I don’t want to go to bed.
bernadette I’m going to count to three. One…
sheldon Oh, all right.
leonard That was amazing how you handled him.
bernadette I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
penny Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.
leonard It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
penny Well, it creeps me out.
leonard Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.
penny Just answer the phone.
leonard Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there.
penny What happened?
leonard Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
penny Okay. Have fun.
leonard Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
security_guard Ball pit.
leonard Thanks for not calling the cops.
security_guard Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a kid who’s special.
leonard Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
sheldon Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
leonard Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
sheldon Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
leonard No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.
sheldon But I’m still working.
leonard If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out.
sheldon You can try, but you’ll never catch me.
leonard For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!
sheldon Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga.
sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
leonard What! What, what, what?
sheldon Leonard and Penny.
leonard What?
sheldon I have good news.
leonard And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
sheldon Your cell phone was off.
leonard Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
sheldon And that didn’t work out, did it?
penny Sheldon, what do you want?
sheldon I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
leonard Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
sheldon No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
penny Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up.
leonard What are you talking about?
penny Oh.
sheldon Einstein.
leonard Yeah, I’m going to need a little more.
sheldon Albert Einstein.
leonard Keep going.
sheldon When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.
leonard So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?
sheldon Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
leonard Sounds like a great plan.
sheldon Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
leonard Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
sheldon You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.
penny Leonard doesn’t snore.
sheldon No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.
leonard Told you.
employment_office_assistant So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for a job.
sheldon A menial job. Like yours.
assistant Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?
sheldon I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
assistant No.
sheldon Shouldn’t you check your database?
assistant No.
sheldon You didn’t really type.
assistant I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?
sheldon Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
assistant No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
sheldon I could do that.
assistant Good.
sheldon One question.
assistant Yes?
sheldon What’s sheetrock?
assistant Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
sheldon That seems acceptable.
assistant Do you have your own car?
sheldon I don’t drive.
assistant Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?
sheldon Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory.
assistant I see. Just give me a second. Security!
penny Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you.
sheldon Behind you.
penny Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
sheldon I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
penny No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
sheldon A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
penny You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
sheldon Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
penny Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
sheldon Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
bernadette Thanks, Sheldon.
penny Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy.
sheldon You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
sheldon All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.
leonard Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
sheldon Yes.
leonard Double guacamole?
sheldon Of course.
leonard No cilantro?
sheldon Nope.
leonard Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
sheldon Yep.
leonard You understand why I’m doing this to you?
sheldon I do.
leonard That’ll be all. That was fun.
raj How long can he keep this up?
leonard I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
raj He never went back to the university?
leonard Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
raj Sheesh.
howard I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
raj But he’s afraid of dogs.
leonard Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.
penny Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?
leonard Sheldon took our order.
penny Sheldon doesn’t work here.
leonard Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either.
sheldon Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
penny Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?
sheldon I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
howard Happy now?
raj I’m on a cloud. Swing me.
leonard Sheldon, come here.
