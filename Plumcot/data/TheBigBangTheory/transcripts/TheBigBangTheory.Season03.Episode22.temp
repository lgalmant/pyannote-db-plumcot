penny Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet.
leonard It’s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
sheldon Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
leonard Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
sheldon This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
leonard Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
sheldon No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
leonard You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
sheldon I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!
penny Who is it?
leonard Leonard.
penny Hang on.
leonard Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
penny Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
leonard You heard that, huh?
penny Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
leonard So you agree, he’s nuts.
penny Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
leonard Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
penny Oh, I do not believe that.
leonard You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. I’d just started at the university.
past_leonard Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment.
man_with_a_box Oh, I bet you’re here to check out the room for rent.
past_leonard Yeah.
man Run away, dude.
past_leonard What?
man Run fast, run far.
leonard That should have been my first clue.
penny So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
leonard For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
penny Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon.
leonard Sure, it makes sense now. . Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
large_black_transvestite Yeah?
past_leonard Dr. Cooper?
transvestite No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.
leonard In retrospect, that was clue number two.
past_sheldon Yes?
past_leonard I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
past_sheldon I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?
past_leonard What?
past_sheldon You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
past_leonard Uh, radon?
past_sheldon Are you asking me or telling me?
past_leonard Telling you? Telling you.
past_sheldon All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?
past_leonard Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
past_sheldon Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
past_leonard Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?
past_sheldon That depends.
past_leonard I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?
past_sheldon No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.
past_leonard There’s three?
past_sheldon Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
past_leonard Okay.
past_sheldon No! That’s where I sit!
past_leonard What’s the difference?
past_sheldon This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.
past_leonard Can you do that?
past_sheldon Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.
past_leonard Uh, yeah, experimental physics.
past_sheldon Hmm.
past_leonard What is that?
past_sheldon Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?
past_leonard Yes.
past_sheldon And you have a vehicle?
past_leonard A car, yeah.
past_sheldon And you’ll be willing to drive me?
past_leonard Well, can’t you drive?
past_sheldon I can. I choose not to.
past_leonard Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?
past_sheldon Why don’t you let me do this.
past_leonard Come on, I just asked.
past_sheldon Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?
past_leonard Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
past_sheldon That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment.
past_leonard Oh, good. I passed the barriers.
past_sheldon The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
past_leonard Uh, I guess.
past_sheldon This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
past_leonard When I have to.
past_sheldon When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies.
past_leonard I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.
past_sheldon I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
past_leonard Fine. I’ll take it.
past_sheldon Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
past_leonard Is this it?
past_sheldon No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room.
past_leonard So where do you sleep?
past_sheldon I don’t understand.
past_leonard If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke.
past_sheldon Do you do this often?
past_leonard On occasion.
past_sheldon Your room. You may want to repaint.
penny Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?
leonard No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details.
past_sheldon Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly.
past_leonard Does that really need to be in the agreement?
past_sheldon We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.
past_leonard We have a flag?
past_sheldon Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.
past_leonard Okay.
past_sheldon Well that’s disappointing.
penny Why on earth did you agree to all that?
leonard It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
penny Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.
leonard Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over.
past_sheldon Leonard?
past_leonard Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.
past_sheldon Leonard?Leonard?
past_leonard I’m sure he’ll go away.
past_sheldon I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
past_leonard What do you want? I didn’t say come in!
past_sheldon You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”
past_leonard I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
joyce_kim That’s it! I’m out of here!
past_leonard But, Joyce, come on.
past_sheldon 12 hours?
penny Oh, my God.
leonard Do I get some sympathy now?
penny A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?
leonard Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
penny Why not?
leonard Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.
penny What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
leonard As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.
penny So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
leonard That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
penny Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
leonard It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work…
past_sheldon What is going on here?
past_leonard Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.
past_howard Hey.
past_raj Hey.
past_sheldon I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
past_howard I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke.
past_leonard Yeah, not a good idea.
past_raj Tushie is buttocks, right?
past_howard Right.
past_raj Hilarious.
past_sheldon Explain the couch.
past_leonard Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
past_sheldon But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
past_leonard They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
past_sheldon Did it occur to you that was by design?
past_leonard According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.
past_sheldon But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.
past_leonard I did notify you.
past_sheldon Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.
past_leonard What am I doing in your spam folder?
past_sheldon I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.
past_raj Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious.
penny Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?
leonard I’m getting to it.
past_sheldon I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.
past_raj Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?
past_sheldon Yes.
past_howard And you just assume you’re always right?
past_sheldon It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me.
past_raj Why?
past_sheldon I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
past_raj Fine.
past_leonard Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!
past_sheldon We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
past_leonard Why not?
past_sheldon Because no one likes Babylon 5.
past_leonard I like it.
past_raj Me, too.
past_howard So do I.
past_leonard There you go– three against one.
past_sheldon They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.
past_leonard But I said no to that.
past_sheldon And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
past_howard Why?
past_sheldon There’s a draft on my neck over here.
past_howard So, I get the draft?
past_sheldon You’re protected by your turtleneck.
past_howard Fine. And it’s a dickey.
past_sheldon Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here.
past_leonard We can fix that. Let’s leave.
past_howard Yeah, we can go over to my place.
past_sheldon Wait. Let me get my jacket.
past_howard You’re not going with us.
past_sheldon Why not?
past_raj You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
past_sheldon Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot.
penny Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.
leonard Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
penny Fine. Go ahead.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, are you having a playdate?
past_howard I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!
mrs_wolowitz Do their parents know they’re here?
past_howard No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!
past_leonard That your dad?
past_howard She grows any more hair on her face, yes.
past_leonard Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?
past_howard Three. I designed the engine myself.
past_raj Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
past_howard Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on.
past_leonard Oh, this just might be your lucky day.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!
past_howard I haven’t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them!
penny So, why was it his lucky day?
leonard Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
penny What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
leonard Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
penny Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
leonard Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment.
past_leonard The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.
past_howard Nice.
past_raj Cool.
past_sheldon Won’t work.
past_leonard Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work.
past_sheldon You don’t see your mistake, do you?
past_leonard There’s no mistake.
past_sheldon This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.
past_leonard Well, I’ve adjusted the formula.
past_sheldon Not correctly.
past_leonard Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.
past_howard What’s happening?
past_leonard A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
past_howard You’re waiting for the elevator?
past_leonard Oh. Right.
past_raj Wait. It’s here.
past_sheldon Give me that.
past_leonard What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time.
past_sheldon You’re welcome.
leonard Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
penny Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
leonard So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
penny Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community.
past_penny Not pregnant. Yes!
sheldon Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
leonard Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
sheldon There’s doubt?
leonard I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.
sheldon That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
leonard Okay, I’m sorry.
sheldon There you go.
leonard So, we’re good?
sheldon Good what?
leonard Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
sheldon Go ahead.
television_voice Up next Babylon 5.
leonard You’re not even watching!
sheldon I can hear it!
leonard Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
sheldon I would hardly call that dialogue!
leonard You’re insane, you know that?!
sheldon Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!
