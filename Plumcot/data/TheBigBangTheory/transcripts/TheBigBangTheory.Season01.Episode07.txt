howard_wolowitz Watch this, it's really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
howards_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?
howard_wolowitz No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
howards_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.
howard_wolowitz No.
leonard_hofstadter Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.
howards_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. .
raj_koothrappali Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist.
sheldon_cooper If we're all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8.
leonard_hofstadter So? We'll start now.
sheldon_cooper Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.
raj_koothrappali We can split it two, two and two.
howard_wolowitz If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time.
sheldon_cooper Oh, what fresh hell is this?
leonard_hofstadter Hey Penny, come on in.
penny Hey guys.
howard_wolowitz See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.
penny No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.
leonard_hofstadter Sure. What's going on.
penny Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska,Christy, well anyway she called me up and she's like 'Hey, how's California,' and I'm like 'Awesome' 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.
sheldon_cooper 8.
penny Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.
howard_wolowitz Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?
penny He really needs to dial it down.
leonard_hofstadter So, if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
penny Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.
sheldon_cooper You know, I apologize for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don't think she's a whore.
penny No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at ... where's Howard?
howard_wolowitz Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town.
sheldon_cooper Oh good grief.
penny Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
sheldon_cooper And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8 and we're still not playing Halo.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.
sheldon_cooper One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!
leonard_hofstadter Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
raj_koothrappali Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from.
penny Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.
leonard_hofstadter Great idea.
sheldon_cooper Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.
penny Why?
sheldon_cooper Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.
penny Oh, what, what, what?
sheldon_cooper This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.
penny Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?
sheldon_cooper Mine.
penny Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.
leonard_hofstadter It's the only way we can play teams.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh ...
penny Ha-ha, there goes your head again.
sheldon_cooper Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to now come on!
sheldon_cooper Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.
penny Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you are on fire.
penny Yeah, so is Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.
penny Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.
sheldon_cooper What?
penny This plasma grenade. Ha! Look, it's raining you!
sheldon_cooper You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.
penny Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?
leonard_hofstadter Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.
penny Well, it's been fun.
leonard_hofstadter You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
penny Or we could just have a life.
leonard_hofstadter I guess for you that's an option.
penny Good night, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
penny As usual, nice talking to you Raj
raj_koothrappali What do you suppose she meant by that?
leonard_hofstadter She's an enigma, Raj.
sheldon_cooper And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab ...
leonard_hofstadter She's gone, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Well she could have said goodbye.
penny Okay, I have a problem.
sheldon_cooper It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.
leonard_hofstadter What's wrong?
penny Um, well, Howard and Christy are ... kind of ... hooking up in my bedroom.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
penny Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
leonard_hofstadter No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.
penny Uh, the couch is good.
sheldon_cooper Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.
leonard_hofstadter Let me guess, you have a problem with this.
sheldon_cooper Where do I begin?
leonard_hofstadter It's up to you, crazy person's choice.
sheldon_cooper Well first, we don't have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.
leonard_hofstadter Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?
sheldon_cooper Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.
leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
sheldon_cooper No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.
penny Hu... what?
sheldon_cooper He's engaging in. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result, and I do not appreciate it.
leonard_hofstadter I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
sheldon_cooper Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
penny How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
sheldon_cooper I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
leonard_hofstadter Here you go.
penny Thanks Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Hmmph, wrong.
penny I'm listening.
sheldon_cooper Your head goes on the other end.
penny Why?
sheldon_cooper It's culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.
penny I'll risk it.
sheldon_cooper Hm!
penny Anything else I should know?
sheldon_cooper Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry about that.
penny That's okay.
leonard_hofstadter FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.
penny Got it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, sleep tight.
penny Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally ... sleep tight.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.
leonard_hofstadter Penny's still sleeping.
sheldon_cooper Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6, poured myself a bowl of cereal ...
leonard_hofstadter I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
sheldon_cooper Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.
penny Uh, what time is it?
leonard_hofstadter Almost 6.
penny I slept all day?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, it's 6 in the morning.
penny What the hell is your problem?
sheldon_cooper Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.
howard_wolowitz Hola, nerd-migos.
penny Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.
penny That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy.
howard_wolowitz In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.
penny Y-you used my loofah?
howard_wolowitz More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
penny You can keep that too.
howard_wolowitz Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.
christy_vanderbilt Howard?
howard_wolowitz In here my lady.
christy_vanderbilt Mmmm, there's my little engine that could.
howard_wolowitz chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
sheldon_cooper Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
christy_vanderbilt Hi,Christy.
leonard_hofstadter Leonard.
sheldon_cooper I'm Sheldon.
christy_vanderbilt Right, you're Howard's entourage.
penny Uh, so Christy, what are your plans?
christy_vanderbilt Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills.
penny Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's ... a little crowded.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.
sheldon_cooper Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B .
howard_wolowitz Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christy stay with me?
leonard_hofstadter For one thing you live with your mother.
howard_wolowitz I do not, my mother lives with me.
sheldon_cooper Well then, it's all settled,Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon you just can't dictate ...
sheldon_cooper No more talking, everybody go!
howard_wolowitz So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?
christy_vanderbilt What is that, like a Mexican deli?
howard_wolowitz I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.
christy_vanderbilt Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!
sheldon_cooper I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers.
christy_vanderbilt But you're still taking me shopping, right?
howard_wolowitz Anything you want.
christy_vanderbilt Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.
howard_wolowitz When they perfect human cloning I'm going to order twelve of those.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, can't you see she's using you?
howard_wolowitz Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!
penny Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
howard_wolowitz Really?
penny Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mitzvah bonds to cash.
sheldon_cooper I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
sheldon_cooper Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?
leonard_hofstadter I see problem.
sheldon_cooper Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
leonard_hofstadter So, we'll just order three entrees.
sheldon_cooper Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling?
raj_koothrappali We could cut it into thirds.
sheldon_cooper Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open, it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
sheldon_cooper He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 I come from Sacramento.
leonard_hofstadter Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 No substitutions.
leonard_hofstadter This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Okay, no reductions.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.
raj_koothrappali That works.
sheldon_cooper No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 No eliminations.
leonard_hofstadter If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.
sheldon_cooper And divide it how, I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.
sheldon_cooper Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.
leonard_hofstadter We don't order egg rolls.
sheldon_cooper Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.
raj_koothrappali Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.
leonard_hofstadter Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.
sheldon_cooper No.
raj_koothrappali Uurgh.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.
sheldon_cooper I'll know.
waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07
raj_koothrappali How about soup?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we can always divide soup.
sheldon_cooper What about the won-tons?
penny Oh, hey guys, what's up?
sheldon_cooper It's Halo night.
penny Yeah. Okay. So?
leonard_hofstadter Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,
penny She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
leonard_hofstadter Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.
penny Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper You can't go out, it's Halo night.
penny Well, for Penny it's dancing night.
sheldon_cooper You go dancing every Wednesday?
penny No.
penny Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
sheldon_cooper Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.
penny Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.
penny Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.
leonard_hofstadter Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.
sheldon_cooper Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.
leonard_hofstadter No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.
raj_koothrappali What's happening to us? We're falling apart.
leonard_hofstadter Who are you calling?
sheldon_cooper The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
howard_wolowitz Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
christy_vanderbilt And this is Christy Van Der Bell.
howard_wolowitz We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!
christy_vanderbilt You're not going to put that on your message are you?
howard_wolowitz No, I'm just kidding, I'll re-record it.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.
sheldon_cooper No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.
leonard_hofstadter You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.
sheldon_cooper My point.
christy_vanderbilt I'm just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.
debbie_wolowitz Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?
howard_wolowitz Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.
christy_vanderbilt@debbie_wolowitz Shut up, Howard!
howard_wolowitz You girl talk, I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin.
christy_vanderbilt Are you happy? You drove your own son out of the house!
debbie_wolowitz Why don't you stop butting in where you don't belong?
howard_wolowitz What are you guys doing here?
sheldon_cooper It's Halo night.
debbie_wolowitz He's not a man, he's a putz, and don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger.
christy_vanderbilt What did you call me?
debbie_wolowitz You heard me, and I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree, 'cause as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will.
christy_vanderbilt You know what? I got better offers. I'm outta here!
debbie_wolowitz That's right, go back to Babylon, you whore!
howard_wolowitz So, Halo night, huh?
raj_koothrappali I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
sheldon_cooper Shhh!
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle.
sheldon_cooper I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
leonard_hofstadter Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.
raj_koothrappali I can't see him!
sheldon_cooper That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.
leonard_hofstadter Well then start throwing grenades.
raj_koothrappali I'm all out!
penny Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.
leonard_hofstadter That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.
sheldon_cooper We said no tanks.
raj_koothrappali There are no rules in hell!
howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!
penny Told yah! .
leonard_hofstadter There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher.
raj_koothrappali All I've got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo.
sheldon_cooper And now you're out of life! Why did you hit pause?
leonard_hofstadter I thought I heard something.
raj_koothrappali What?
leonard_hofstadter No, never mind, alright, go.
