penny Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.
sheldon Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
leonard We must not be playing it right.
penny All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
sheldon Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
penny Yay.
sheldon You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
leonard Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday.
sheldon Why not?
leonard Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
penny Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.
leonard There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?
penny Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.
leonard Wait. What are you talking about?
penny My friend, Justin.
sheldon Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday.
leonard Who is this Justin?
sheldon Your turn, Leonard.
penny I told you about him.
leonard No, you didn’t.
sheldon Roll the dice, Leonard.
penny Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he’s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.
sheldon Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
leonard Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
penny He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.
leonard So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
penny Well, he’s definitely not gay.
leonard Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.
penny Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.
leonard Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
sheldon I’ll just roll for you.
penny Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
leonard What was your first clue?
sheldon Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
penny You know what? Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot.
leonard I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
sheldon You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
penny How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!
sheldon It’s also your roll.
leonard You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?
penny Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it’s none of your business!
leonard Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
penny Oh, now I’m a child? Well, at least I’m not an idiot anymore!
leonard The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
penny Oh, you are such a… What the hell is he doing?
leonard He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
penny Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!
leonard I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender.
sheldon Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
leonard No, we just had a little spat.
sheldon Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
leonard I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
sheldon Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
leonard I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.
sheldon It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?
leonard An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.
sheldon All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
leonard And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
sheldon Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
leonard What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
sheldon Leonard! Stop the car!
leonard What?
sheldon I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
sheldon Come on, come on, we’re late.
leonard Calm down, we’ll make the movie.
sheldon I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
raj Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
sheldon Go, go, Power Rangers, go!
penny Hey.
leonard Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies.
sheldon No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.
leonard Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?
penny Not really, no.
sheldon All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening.
leonard Just give us a minute.
howard Oh, take all the time you need.
leonard So, are we going to talk about last night?
penny Are you ready to apologize?
leonard No.
penny E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.
leonard Oh, come on. This is stupid.
penny Oh, there it is again! You think I’m stupid!
leonard No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
penny Oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!
leonard No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!
raj Well, that was rather unpleasant.
howard Yeah, I don’t think I need my preshow urination anymore.
sheldon Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies.
howard Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.
sheldon Got it.
howard Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It’ll help take your mind off things.
stuart Hey, guys. What’s going on?
leonard Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.
stuart Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let’s face it, that’s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.
leonard Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
howard No, I mean, she’s obviously way out of line.
leonard Thank you!
howard But if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?
leonard I am not going to fold.
raj Well, excuse me, I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”
howard Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off.
raj You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
howard I didn’t know you were upset about that.
raj Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.
howard Okay, sorry.
raj Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!
howard I said I’m sorry.
raj Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
howard Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”
raj Oh, my God, you are such a mama’s boy.
howard Hey, don’t bring my mother into this!
raj You brought your mother into this!
sheldon Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
howard Boy, what got him so upset?
raj Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon’s upset.
penny Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm.
penny Is Leonard coming?
sheldon No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.
penny Well, that’s not gonna happen.
sheldon I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
penny Which is?
sheldon I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
penny I’m busy.
sheldon Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch.
penny Fine. What do you want?
sheldon I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
penny Yes.
sheldon Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?
penny No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.
sheldon You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.
penny Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?
sheldon Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
penny Great.
sheldon Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
penny Don’t you usually get lemonade?
sheldon Yes.
penny Do you want lemonade?
sheldon Yes.
penny Anything else?
sheldon Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
penny I am not going to apologize. I’ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
sheldon Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
penny Well, I’m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn’t about you.
sheldon I don’t follow.
penny Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
sheldon All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.
penny Leonard is wrong.
sheldon Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?
penny I’m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I’ve committed?
sheldon Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
penny Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?
sheldon Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.
penny My singing?
sheldon That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it.
penny Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?
sheldon Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper.
penny Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
sheldon And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour.
leonard Sure.
sheldon Go apologize to Penny.
leonard What?
sheldon Right now would be good.
penny Leonard!
sheldon Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.
penny I hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.
leonard What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
penny It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true, isn’t it?
leonard Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!
penny That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!
leonard Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?
penny Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.
leonard Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
penny No, I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!
leonard Why didn’t you say so?
penny Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!
leonard Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!
penny Really? Why not? You’re so smart, and I’m so dumb!
sheldon Raj. Raj. Raj.
raj Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding.
mrs_koothrappali Sheldon, ask our son what we’re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.
raj I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
mrs_koothrappali You should be thanking us!
dr_koothrappali Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.
raj I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?
mrs_koothrappali Because you’re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.
raj Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding.
penny Sheldon!
leonard What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
penny Hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
leonard The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t.
penny What stop sign?
leonard Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
howards_mother Howard, answer the door! I’m busy!
howard I’m busy too, you answer it.
howards_mother I can’t! I’m on the toilet!
howard For God’s sake, I don’t need to hear that! Can’t you just say, I’m busy?
howards_mother I said I’m busy, but that wasn’t good enough for you!
howard You know what? I hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.
howards_mother Well, if it’s a home invader, don’t tell them I’m on the toilet!
howard There’s no one there. You’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!
leonard Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?
stuart Yeah, he’s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.
leonard Thank you.
stuart Uh, Penny?
penny Yeah?
stuart Is everything okay?
penny What do you mean?
stuart Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?
penny Oh, yeah, kind of. It’s, it’s no big thing.
stuart Oh, good, good. I love you.
leonard I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
penny All right, what’s going on?
leonard It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us.
sheldon Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
penny Come on, Sheldon, let’s go home. Look, we’re done fighting.
sheldon I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
penny Okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
sheldon Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
leonard Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?
penny Oh, my God, would you let this go?!
stuart I’d let it go.
leonard Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.
penny Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let’s just… Sheldon, please,
leonard Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
penny You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?
sheldon I want that one.
penny Okay, you can have that one.
leonard Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.
penny Buy him the robot, Leonard.
sheldon Can I get this comic book, too?
penny Yes, you can.
stuart We meet again.
leonard So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
penny He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.
sheldon I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
