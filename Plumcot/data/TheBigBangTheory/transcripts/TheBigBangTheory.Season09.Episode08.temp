penny I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
leonard Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.
penny Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
leonard Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.
penny Oh, I don’t want credit for that.
sheldon Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.
leonard You’re in a good mood.
sheldon Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
penny Oh. Good for you.
leonard What brought this on?
sheldon I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.
penny And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
sheldon No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
leonard Hey, I made French toast sticks.
sheldon On oatmeal day?
leonard Ah, I also made oatmeal.
sheldon Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like.
penny Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
sheldon Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
howard No problem.
raj So what’s up?
sheldon Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.
howard You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.
sheldon Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
raj You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
howard Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.
raj Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.
sheldon Gentlemen.
raj Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.
howard But what are you looking for?
sheldon All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.
howard Isn’t that a little unreasonable?
sheldon All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.
penny Come on, Amy, show us the dress.
amy Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
penny Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.
bernadette Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.
amy Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.
penny No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
amy Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.
penny Ooh.
bernadette Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.
penny Yeah, come on, tell us more.
amy Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?
bernadette Did you kiss him yet?
amy Just a little peck on the lips.
penny Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.
amy Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one.
penny All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?
bernadette Tea and basketball?
amy To that new Italian place on Walnut.
bernadette Oh, nice.
amy I’m gonna go look for other shoes.
penny Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
bernadette Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?
penny We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
bernadette I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation.
penny Damn, you’re sneaky.
bernadette Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.
howard I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.
sheldon Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
raj And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
sheldon Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.
howard If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?
sheldon Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.
howard You seriously think women would fight for you?
sheldon People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?
howard He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes.
raj Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.
howard Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist.
sheldon And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
raj I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
howard I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.
sheldon Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.
raj Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
howard Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.
raj I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
howard Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize.
leonard I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
penny Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
leonard What? I don’t want to do that.
penny What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
leonard This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
penny No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.
leonard So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
penny You’re not curious who she’s out with?
leonard Not really.
penny But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.
sheldon That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
howard Congratulations.
raj This is exciting.
sheldon Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.
howard Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
sheldon And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.
raj I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
howard Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.
sheldon Golly, she sounds too good to be true.
tall_british_dave This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce.
amy Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?
dave Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.
amy Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.
dave No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.
penny Hey. So, where are they?
bernadette Across the street, in the left window.
penny Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.
bernadette Right here.
leonard You just happen to have those in the car?
bernadette Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.
leonard By stalking them?
bernadette No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
penny Oh, there he is.
bernadette He’s cute, right?
penny Yeah.
leonard Can I see?
penny What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.
leonard I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.
penny Fine.
leonard Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.
bernadette Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone.
penny Your what?
bernadette Nothing. Not important.
dave So you’ve never been married?
amy No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship.
dave Oh. What happened with that?
amy That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.
dave Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?
amy No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
dave I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?
amy Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.
dave Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
amy I’m trying not to. Do you know him?
dave No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?
penny He really seems into her.
bernadette I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
leonard Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
bernadette Why’d you bring him?
penny I had to; we’re married now.
bernadette Ugh, I hear that.
dave I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.
amy Sure, why not?
dave It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?
amy Um about an hour and half.
dave Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?
amy Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.
dave Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius, and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.
amy What was the rest of your question?
dave Do you think you could introduce me to him?
amy Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
dave You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to do.
leonard Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
bernadette Right here.
raj 37 minutes left until the deadline.
sheldon Someone will show.
howard And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.
raj Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
sheldon Someone will show.
raj Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.
sheldon Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.
dave You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.
amy I have a DVD of that lecture.
dave Really? Wasn’t it great?
amy Not as a Valentine’s present, no.
dave Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.
amy That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?
dave Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.
amy No, you’re not.
dave Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention.
amy Thank you.
dave That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on Thursday.
bernadette Hey, hey, they’re leaving.
penny What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us.
bernadette We got to get out of here.
penny Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?
bernadette He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
penny Oh, no.
dave She just hit my car.
amy What are you guys doing here?
bernadette Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?
leonard What happened?
dave O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?
leonard Yeah.
dave I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
amy No. Pinch me.
dave It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?
leonard I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.
dave Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.
leonard You really should.
raj Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
sheldon One minute is a long time.
howard I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.
raj Forty-five.
sheldon 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.
raj Thirty seconds.
sheldon Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?
howard What?
sheldon Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.
howard You thought she was great in X-Men.
sheldon Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
raj Guys, fifteen seconds.
howard Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
sheldon Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.
raj Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad.
howard Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
raj I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because… we are the dreamers of dreams.
howard It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty.
raj Answer it.
sheldon All right. Can I help you?
girl Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?
sheldon Yes.
girl Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.
sheldon Careful, it’s addictive.
vanessa Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.
sheldon And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
vanessa Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
sheldon I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.
raj How could you send her away?
sheldon She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.
dave Uh, thanks for driving me home.
amy No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.
dave Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again.
amy Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out.
dave Oh. Okay.
amy I’m, I’m really sorry.
dave No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.
amy There you go.
dave If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common.
amy Sure. Heh.
dave And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think about it…
amy Okay, get out.
