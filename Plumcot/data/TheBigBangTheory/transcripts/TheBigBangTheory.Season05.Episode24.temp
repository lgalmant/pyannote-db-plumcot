mission_control Launch step twelve reading okay.
cosmonaut Launch step twelve acknowledged.
howard Hey Mike?
mike_massimino Yeah.
howard I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.
mike Good one.
howard Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.
leonard Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
sheldon 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.
amy I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?
sheldon Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.
amy The uterus quivers, does it not?
leonard There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.
bernadette Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch.
raj You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.
sheldon Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.
bernadette Give me those damn Pringles.
cosmonaut Are all of the systems of the ship ready?
mission_control Da.
mike Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?
howard Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?
mike Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?
howard Check.
cosmonaut He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?
howard No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.
cosmonaut Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.
mike Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.
cosmonaut Congratulations.
howard Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.
cosmonaut You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?
howard Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.
howard Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.
bernadette Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again.
howard No, here.
bernadette Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me.
howard Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.
bernadette Oh, my God.
howard Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything.
bernadette This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.
howard Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.
mrs_wolowitz ‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?
howard No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!
bernadette Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married.
howard What?
bernadette I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
howard But I’m leaving in two days.
mrs_wolowitz What about Apple Jacks?
howard I don’t need to take cereal.
mrs_wolowitz What kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in Russia?
howard They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.
mrs_wolowitz They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go.
bernadette We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.
howard Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.
mrs_wolowitz You know what, I’ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.
bernadette So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.
leonard That’s so great.
howard I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us.
amy No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.
bernadette That wasn’t going to be our processional music.
amy Well, it was going to be mine.
sheldon Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.
leonard Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun.
sheldon That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
bernadette So, what do you say, Amy?
amy Can I wear my maid of honour dress?
bernadette Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?
amy It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?
penny Amy, you look great.
amy I know.
leonard Where’d you get a beer?
raj From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know.
amy Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?
sheldon It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?
howard You proposed to Penny?
leonard I don’t want to talk about it.
raj Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
leonard She said no, can we drop it now?
penny It wasn’t a real proposal.
bernadette Why wasn’t it a real proposal?
sheldon He asked her during coitus.
howard Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
bernadette Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day.
howard I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette.
penny Good move telling Sheldon.
leonard What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?
amy All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.
registrar Folks, can I have your attention. It’s five o’clock, we’re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.
bernadette Oh, no.
howard I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.
registrar Yeah, me, too. I’ll see you there.
bernadette I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
amy Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.
cosmonaut So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don’t get a dog, I’m not walking it, I’m not feeding it, I’m not picking up after it.
mike You know you’re going to wind up walking it.
cosmonaut I know.
howard Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?
mike Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.
dimitri Okay, I’m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.
mike Is that better?
howard Thanks.
howard You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.
bernadette No, isn’t that kind of tacky?
penny Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.
bernadette Are any of them still married?
penny Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…
bernadette There’s got to be some place special we could do it.
sheldon Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?
leonard Will you shut up?
raj Well, I know how to make it special.
howard I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.
raj Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.
all Oh!
leonard That’s so cool.
howard Oh, wait to go, Raj.
raj I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.
howard Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.
leonard How about our roof?
bernadette Oh, I like that.
howard That’s great.
amy Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.
howard So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony.
penny Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.
bernadette Great, well, who’s it going to be?
sheldon I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
bernadette No.
sheldon What do you see in her?
dimitri Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?
howard Leaking? What’s leaking?
dimitri Fuel. Shh.
mission_control Not bad. We feel okay to go.
dimitri Okay, thanks Mission Control.
howard There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?
mike Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.
dimitri This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.
howard What happens on the tenth time?
dimitri Problem.
howard Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.
raj Oh, thanks, man.
sheldon You didn’t have to do that.
howard Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.
leonard Oh, wow.
sheldon Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.
howard What?
sheldon While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.
howard Yeah, so?
sheldon I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.
leonard I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
sheldon Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.
amy Who is it?
howard It’s the groom.
amy Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
howard Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back.
bernadette Why can’t she drive herself?
howard She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
bernadette All right, just hurry!
howard Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.
leonard Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start.
raj What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready.
howard Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?
mrs_wolowitz I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to fall off the roof.
howard You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
raj Penny.
mr_rostenkowski Your new mother-in-law’s a piece of work.
bernadette Not now, Dad.
mr_rostenkowski She’s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.
bernadette Here you go? What am I, a football?
mr_rostenkowski Like that guy could catch a football.
raj Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.
mrs_wolowitz Louder!
bernadette They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.
raj Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute.
penny Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.
leonard Hmm.
penny Problem?
leonard No.
sheldon I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
penny Oh, grow up.
leonard Hey, I didn’t say it.
amy All right, that’s enough from the both of you.
penny Well, he started it.
amy Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.
leonard Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
sheldon Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.
bernadette Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
sheldon Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.
raj I believe you two have prepared vows?
bernadette Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.
howard Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.
mrs_wolowitz Speak up!
howard Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you.
all By the power vested in us, by the state of California…
sheldon And the Klingon High Council…
all We now pronounce you husband and wife.
mike That’s ignition. I love this part.
dimitri Me, too.
howard I have strongly mixed feelings.
bernadette Oh, my God, it’s happening.
penny Did I miss it?
leonard No, come on in. Hurry.
bernadette I love that man.
raj Me, too.
penny I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.
leonard This is it.
sheldon Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.
howard Oy vay!
