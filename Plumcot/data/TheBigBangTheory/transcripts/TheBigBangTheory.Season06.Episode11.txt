penny Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.
leonard_hofstadter Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.
penny You’re so butch.
leonard_hofstadter Aw, I got a little paper cut.
penny Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.
penny Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.
penny Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?
leonard_hofstadter Little bit, yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, oh, I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited.
amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
sheldon_cooper Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.
amy_farrah_fowler By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, like a bunch of savages.
bernadette_rostenkowski Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.
howard_wolowitz But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re an idiot.
howard_wolowitz I’m your idiot. Forever.
raj_koothrappali So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.
stuart_bloom Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!
leonard_hofstadter All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.
sheldon_cooper A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.
stuart_bloom What’s wrong with Christmas?
sheldon_cooper Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?
sheldon_cooper Actually that helps, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Would you just look inside?
sheldon_cooper Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.
leonard_hofstadter It’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.
sheldon_cooper Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.
raj_koothrappali Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.
stuart_bloom Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?
sheldon_cooper I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Howard, what do you do?
howard_wolowitz I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.
leonard_hofstadter And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
howard_wolowitz Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.
raj_koothrappali No, screw that noise, I’m going in. Hang on, Santa, I’m coming for you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game.
raj_koothrappali But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?
sheldon_cooper Lucky.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, come on, moving on.
raj_koothrappali Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.
stuart_bloom Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.
penny Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.
sheldon_cooper I know they’re making a rhetorical point, I just don’t know what it is.
penny See you, boys. We are going drinking.
raj_koothrappali Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry, Raj, it’s girls’ night out.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe another time.
leonard_hofstadter Okay…
penny Come on.
raj_koothrappali Ooh! Girls’ night, girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!
stuart_bloom How does he not hear that?
amy_farrah_fowler So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?
bernadette_rostenkowski No!
penny No!
amy_farrah_fowler Geez, who’s Forever 63 now?
raj_koothrappali Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
amy_farrah_fowler Thanks.
penny Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of Pabst.
raj_koothrappali My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, let’s help Raj meet a girl tonight.
raj_koothrappali No, no, no, I’m fine.
penny Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s get him laid!
raj_koothrappali Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.
penny Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you’re a real catch. I know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life.
raj_koothrappali That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
bernadette_rostenkowski We’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.
penny Nines or tens?
raj_koothrappali Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.
bernadette_rostenkowski Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?
raj_koothrappali In a New Delhi minute.
stuart_bloom I don’t remember you buying these miniatures in my store.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, yeah. I got ’em on Amazon.
stuart_bloom Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?
leonard_hofstadter I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.
stuart_bloom Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.
howard_wolowitz Can we please move this along?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.
howard_wolowitz Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile.
leonard_hofstadter Great. What do you do?
howard_wolowitz I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”
sheldon_cooper I open the chest.
leonard_hofstadter It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.
stuart_bloom That’s not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.
leonard_hofstadter Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.
howard_wolowitz Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
leonard_hofstadter Walls are getting closer.
stuart_bloom Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
sheldon_cooper Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.
leonard_hofstadter You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.
howard_wolowitz What are we supposed to do?
leonard_hofstadter Seven, six.
sheldon_cooper Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.
howard_wolowitz Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.
leonard_hofstadter Three, two.
stuart_bloom Somebody sing the damn song.
sheldon_cooper Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even
leonard_hofstadter The walls are getting slower.
sheldon_cooper Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.
howard_wolowitz That was amazing, Sheldon.
stuart_bloom How did you know that?
sheldon_cooper It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, continuing our quest.
sheldon_cooper W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…
bernadette_rostenkowski Looks like he’s doing pretty good.
penny Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.
amy_farrah_fowler That is some low-hanging fruit.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, here he comes.
penny So, how’d it go?
raj_koothrappali Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.
penny Ooh!
bernadette_rostenkowski Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
raj_koothrappali What?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart, I’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t.
penny Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s not. She was too beautiful for me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why would you say that?
raj_koothrappali It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
amy_farrah_fowler The two of them? I don’t understand.
raj_koothrappali Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.
amy_farrah_fowler And you liked Bernadette also?
raj_koothrappali That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.
amy_farrah_fowler So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.
raj_koothrappali No, not really.
penny Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
raj_koothrappali Not that I can think of.
bernadette_rostenkowski Think harder.
raj_koothrappali Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?
sheldon_cooper Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.
howard_wolowitz Done?
sheldon_cooper I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
sheldon_cooper Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. What’s the difference?
sheldon_cooper Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
sheldon_cooper What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
leonard_hofstadter You see those, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s like I’m really there.
stuart_bloom I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.
howard_wolowitz Good story.
leonard_hofstadter What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
sheldon_cooper Yes. What, is there a problem?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.
sheldon_cooper Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.
sheldon_cooper Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?
leonard_hofstadter Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.
stuart_bloom What was so bad about them?
leonard_hofstadter I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.
sheldon_cooper No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.
raj_koothrappali Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
amy_farrah_fowler Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.
raj_koothrappali I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.
amy_farrah_fowler You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.
raj_koothrappali Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.
amy_farrah_fowler I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.
raj_koothrappali It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
amy_farrah_fowler It is, isn’t it?
raj_koothrappali But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too.
raj_koothrappali Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now.
raj_koothrappali Damn it.
penny What?
raj_koothrappali Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her.
sheldon_cooper All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
howard_wolowitz Great. Let’s do it.
leonard_hofstadter The drawbridge is lowering.
stuart_bloom My carpal tunnel’s acting up.
sheldon_cooper Play through the pain.
leonard_hofstadter You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.
howard_wolowitz Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.
stuart_bloom I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
sheldon_cooper But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.
howard_wolowitz Wait, what are you doing?
sheldon_cooper You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, okay.
sheldon_cooper My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.
leonard_hofstadter This is weird, right?
sheldon_cooper Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!
leonard_hofstadter Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.
sheldon_cooper Santa?
santa Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.
sheldon_cooper Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.
santa Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them.
sheldon_cooper I understand.
santa But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I hope it’s a train.
santa Oh, it’s better than a train.
sheldon_cooper Two trains?
santa Better.
sheldon_cooper I’m getting three trains.
santa Okay, open ’em. This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!
sheldon_cooper Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…
santa Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork.
