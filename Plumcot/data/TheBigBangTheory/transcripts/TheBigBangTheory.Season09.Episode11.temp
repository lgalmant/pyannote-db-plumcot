caption THE BIG BANG THEORY
caption EPISODE 194
caption THE OPENING NIGHT EXCITATION
caption It is a period of great tension. Our heroes, Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Koothrappali know that tickets to the new Star Wars movie are about to be available for pre-sale.
caption If they fail in their mission and can’t see it on opening night Sheldon has sworn that they will never hear the end of it for the rest of their lives…
caption They believe him.
leonard Guys, tickets already went on sale.
sheldon What?
howard They’re not supposed to be available yet.
leonard I don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale.
raj Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?
sheldon The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.
leonard Yeah, me, too.
howard Same here!
raj Guys, they’re gonna sell out.
howard What are we gonna do?!
sheldon All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.
howard Got ’em.
sheldon And I will continue to do so!
penny I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.
sheldon Oh, thank you.
leonard I’m also really happy, but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days.
sheldon Hey, Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.
penny Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday.
sheldon And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed.
penny You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
leonard I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
sheldon But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?
penny Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake.
arthur Oh, great. This again.
sheldon Arthur, what brings you back?
arthur Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn’t a, a sex dream.
sheldon In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma.
arthur And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What’s, what’s troubling you?
sheldon Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.
arthur Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?
sheldon Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.
arthur And they, they, they don’t wear underwear.
sheldon So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?
arthur Uh, do, do you love this girl?
sheldon Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.
arthur Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.
sheldon By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?
arthur Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.
sheldon You’re right.
arthur Great.
sheldon Where are you going?
arthur I don’t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.
amy Sheldon, what’s wrong?
sheldon I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you.
amy Okay.
sheldon See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.
amy Obi-what?
sheldon I’ll, I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.
amy Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?
sheldon It’s late. Got to go. Bye.
raj Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.
leonard I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
howard Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?
sheldon No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy.
leonard You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.
sheldon This is my ticket to Star Wars….
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
bernadette What happens if I say, come in?
penny Well, find out.
bernadette Come in.
sheldon Bernadette. Bernadette. Bernadette.
penny Come in.
sheldon Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
bernadette Just come in.
sheldon For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I’ll stream it on Netflix.
penny We’re sorry. What do you need?
sheldon Well, as you know, I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.
bernadette Sure.
sheldon Well, so far, I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.
penny Wow. You can really arrange that?
sheldon Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s, they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.
bernadette How about something a little more realistic?
sheldon Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.
penny Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
bernadette Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.
sheldon No, no, no, no. She’d be going alone. Well, if you think I’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.
penny Okay, well, what’s the third option?
sheldon That I have coitus with her.
leonard What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?
raj I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
howard It’s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.
leonard He’s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?
stuart My, uh, my doctor’s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?
leonard Well…
wil_wheaton Hey, you guys.
howard Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?
wil Absolutely.
stuart Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.
penny Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing.
bernadette Wild thang.
sheldon Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left.
penny Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.
bernadette Yeah, are you ready for this?
sheldon Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.
penny Sheldon, that’s so beautiful.
sheldon Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.
amy Thanks for taking me out.
penny Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?
bernadette So where do you want to go?
amy I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.
penny Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.
amy Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?
penny Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought.
amy I think I’ll just stick to Mexican.
bernadette Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.
amy Okay, what is going on?
penny Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.
amy What surprises?
bernadette We don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical.
amy You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?
penny Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
amy I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say.
bernadette Well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…
amy I do know what to say. Let’s get me waxed.
arthur Why isn’t it ever Angie Dickinson’s bedroom?
sheldon You’re back.
arthur It, it doesn’t seem like it’s up to me.
sheldon I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before.
arthur Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.
sheldon So, can you help me?
arthur Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…
sheldon Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.
arthur Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.
sheldon I think they say junk.
arthur What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?
sheldon This is an important night for us, and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.
arthur Sheldon, if, if you’re with the right person, it, it’ll be okay.
sheldon Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.
arthur Well, that’s, that’s very nice of you to say, but I think I’m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.
sheldon Oh, sure. Well, you’re fun to look at.
raj Tonight’s the night.
leonard Yeah, the wait is finally over.
penny I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.
howard Ready to go?
raj Let’s do this.
penny Have fun, guys.
leonard We will.
raj I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.
howard I know.
leonard We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.
bernadette No, they’re not.
penny Knowing them, they will.
howard T minus 15 minutes.
raj Oh, did you hear from Wil?
leonard Yeah, he’s on his way. Time for bladder check.
raj Check.
leonard Check.
howard Check. Wait. Screw it. I’m holding it.
raj What is everyone booing at?
wil Hey, guys. What’s up?
leonard Um, hey, Wil. What you doin’?
wil I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.
man Star Trek stinks!
wil Yeah? Live long and suck it.
sheldon Birthday girl. Birthday girl. Birthday girl.
amy Come in.
sheldon Oh.
amy Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
amy That’s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I’ll, I’m gonna go put these in water.
sheldon Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.
amy Do you like it?
sheldon It’s kind of spooky.
amy I can change it back.
sheldon No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine.
amy So, what’d you have in mind for tonight?
sheldon I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.
amy Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.
sheldon Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.
amy You mean before you give it to me?
sheldon Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
amy Of course.
sheldon Why are we saying give it to you like that?
amy Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.
sheldon I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent.
amy Yes.
sheldon You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.
leonard So, if you don’t like Star Wars, why are you here?
wil Oh, I’m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie’s bad, it’s gonna ruin their lives.
raj Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me.
wil See? That’s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn’t gonna change at all.
howard He’s right.
leonard Yeah. No matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.
bernadette Do you think Sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?
penny I don’t know. He said he’s ready.
bernadette Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.
penny Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.
amy Hi.
sheldon Hello.
amy So, um, should I get under the covers with you?
sheldon All right. Hello.
amy Hi.
sheldon Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
amy I’m just, um, really nervous.
sheldon Why?
amy Well, I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’ve just built it up in my head. I don’t know what to expect.
sheldon Neither do I. But we can find out together.
amy Okay.
leonard I’m really nervous.
howard I know. We’ve been waiting so long for this.
raj And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
wil Guys, it’s just a movie.
leonard That’s true.
howard He’s right.
raj It is.
wil Although, we all remember Jar Jar.
raj Leonard, I, I’m scared again.
caption A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away….
sheldon Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
amy Me, too.
sheldon I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
amy That works for me.
wil I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
raj I don’t think I can walk right now.
arthur Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?
sheldon Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don’t think I need any more advice.
arthur I, I was just curious. How, how’d it go?
sheldon Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.
arthur But, uh, what, what about Amy?
sheldon Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn’t have the history with the franchise I do.
arthur Okay. Good, good talk.
