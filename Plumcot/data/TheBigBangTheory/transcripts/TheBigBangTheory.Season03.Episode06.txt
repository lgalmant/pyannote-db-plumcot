leonard_hofstadter Kites, ho!
howard_wolowitz Kites ho!
raj_koothrappali Kites ho!
all_three#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Kites, ho!
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!
the_three_guys#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Kites, ho!
penny Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?
leonard_hofstadter If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.
leonard_hofstadter We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
penny Kite fighting?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
sheldon_cooper Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.
leonard_hofstadter You want to come watch?
penny Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Football, sure.
howard_wolowitz Good guess.
penny I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.
penny Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, great.
penny See ya.
leonard_hofstadter Well, this sucks.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
raj_koothrappali Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that certainly would suck.
sheldon_cooper Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.
leonard_hofstadter Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
sheldon_cooper Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her.
sheldon_cooper You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
sheldon_cooper Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
raj_koothrappali Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…
howard_wolowitz Whoa! Did you see that?
raj_koothrappali See what?
howard_wolowitz That chick, she smiled at me.
raj_koothrappali No, she didn’t.
howard_wolowitz Yes, she did.
raj_koothrappali Come on, scissors, scissors!
howard_wolowitz Hold my line.
raj_koothrappali Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
sheldon_cooper Victory!
raj_koothrappali Son of a bitch.
raj_koothrappali You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.
howard_wolowitz What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
raj_koothrappali If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
howard_wolowitz I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.
raj_koothrappali Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.
leonard_hofstadter So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?
sheldon_cooper Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, how kind of her.
sheldon_cooper Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
raj_koothrappali You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with.
howard_wolowitz I totally had a shot.
raj_koothrappali With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. I have your kite. I have your kite.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter How was your football party?
penny It was pretty good. We won.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t
penny I’m glad to hear it.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
penny Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.
penny Sure you have.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?
penny Of course not.
leonard_hofstadter Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
penny Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored.
leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
penny Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.
penny Like who?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.
penny Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
leonard_hofstadter Another football game?
penny They have them every week.
leonard_hofstadter Did not know that.
penny You wanted to meet my friends.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.
penny Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.
raj_koothrappali Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.
leonard_hofstadter Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.
raj_koothrappali I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
howard_wolowitz Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?
howard_wolowitz Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
raj_koothrappali It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them.
howard_wolowitz But I had a shot with that jogger.
raj_koothrappali Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
howard_wolowitz It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
leonard_hofstadter There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
howard_wolowitz All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.
leonard_hofstadter Sacks, sacks…
sheldon_cooper It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
leonard_hofstadter Huh… Scrimmage…
sheldon_cooper The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon knows football?
leonard_hofstadter Apparently.
howard_wolowitz I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
sheldon_cooper I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
leonard_hofstadter Unbelievable.
sheldon_cooper If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.
leonard_hofstadter So you could teach me?
sheldon_cooper Football or chicken-fried meats?
leonard_hofstadter Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
sheldon_cooper If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.
sheldon_cooper That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.
leonard_hofstadter Please, I’m asking you as a friend.
sheldon_cooper Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
leonard_hofstadter I really appreciate this.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.
leonard_hofstadter When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
sheldon_cooper When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong with a football jersey?
sheldon_cooper Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
leonard_hofstadter I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, wish me luck.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.
sheldon_cooper How would you put it?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, like you said.
sheldon_cooper Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.
leonard_hofstadter Good-Bye, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
sheldon_cooper What’s funny about Cylon toast?
raj_koothrappali It’s open.
howard_wolowitz Hey, pal.
raj_koothrappali What do you want?
howard_wolowitz I brought you a little gift. New kite.
raj_koothrappali The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?
raj_koothrappali Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.
howard_wolowitz Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be.
raj_koothrappali You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.
howard_wolowitz Stipulated.
raj_koothrappali And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.
howard_wolowitz I know, I know.
raj_koothrappali And where were you?
howard_wolowitz Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.
raj_koothrappali You’re impossible.
howard_wolowitz Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.
howard_wolowitz No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself.
raj_koothrappali No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.
howard_wolowitz Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know.
howard_wolowitz Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
raj_koothrappali I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
howard_wolowitz Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.
raj_koothrappali Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?
leonard_hofstadter Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
penny Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Did not know that.
penny How much beer have you had?
leonard_hofstadter None, why?
penny Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.
guy_in_baseball_hat#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding.
second_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Totally.
leonard_hofstadter That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
penny Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant.
penny I know. I just need you stop talking.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Sheldon, come in.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.
penny There’s some in the fridge.
sheldon_cooper You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
penny On Earth, we say thank you.
sheldon_cooper So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
leonard_hofstadter Mimesis?
sheldon_cooper You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I guess so.
sheldon_cooper Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.
sheldon_cooper I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
penny You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.
penny Until half time.
leonard_hofstadter This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
penny And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you’re kidding me.
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter Nice meeting all of you.
penny So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart.
raj_koothrappali I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
howard_wolowitz My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie.
raj_koothrappali I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
howard_wolowitz Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?
raj_koothrappali Fine. Go ahead.
howard_wolowitz No. This is our day.
raj_koothrappali If you want to chase after her, chase after her.
howard_wolowitz Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that.
raj_koothrappali Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
howard_wolowitz You think so?
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.
raj_koothrappali Actually, in this case, I think she was.
howard_wolowitz Really?
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
howard_wolowitz Bye.
raj_koothrappali What a douche.
