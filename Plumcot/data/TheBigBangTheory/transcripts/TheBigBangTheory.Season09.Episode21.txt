sheldon_cooper I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?
leonard_hofstadter No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.
raj_koothrappali But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
howard_wolowitz But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.
sheldon_cooper Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?
leonard_hofstadter But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
raj_koothrappali Well, that’s just Batman.
leonard_hofstadter No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.
howard_wolowitz So does that answer your question?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you were back with Emily.
raj_koothrappali Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them.
leonard_hofstadter You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
raj_koothrappali No, I’m actually dating two women. Later.
leonard_hofstadter Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
howard_wolowitz I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?
sheldon_cooper What, why did you get a party sub?
leonard_hofstadter People are coming over, it looked fun.
sheldon_cooper Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.
leonard_hofstadter Your attendance implies it’s not.
sheldon_cooper I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.
sheldon_cooper Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, you know what? I’m not going.
sheldon_cooper Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.
leonard_hofstadter This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
sheldon_cooper You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
leonard_hofstadter You’re the only one who eats them.
sheldon_cooper And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?
leonard_hofstadter I’m not going, you can’t make me.
sheldon_cooper Well, we’ll just see about that.
penny What is the problem?
sheldon_cooper He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
penny Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
leonard_hofstadter You have fun. I will not be attending.
sheldon_cooper Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.
leonard_hofstadter You’re being ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.
leonard_hofstadter Can you please talk to him?
penny Well, why are you fighting him on this?
leonard_hofstadter Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.
penny Well, I will still come to your meeting.
sheldon_cooper Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you taking his side?
penny Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.
sheldon_cooper You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.
raj_koothrappali Man, I’m worn out.
howard_wolowitz I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
raj_koothrappali No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting.
howard_wolowitz You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
raj_koothrappali But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.
howard_wolowitz I guess I am lucky.
raj_koothrappali You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?
bernadette_rostenkowski Good. A little tired.
raj_koothrappali I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.
howard_wolowitz You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?
bernadette_rostenkowski You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.
sheldon_cooper Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
penny Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.
penny Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.
leonard_hofstadter Leave me alone.
penny If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.
leonard_hofstadter Not funny.
penny You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here.
penny Really? The only adult?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s right.
sheldon_cooper Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.
penny All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.
leonard_hofstadter And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.
sheldon_cooper All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.
leonard_hofstadter Stop saying meeting.
sheldon_cooper Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.
amy_farrah_fowler I brought my famous spinach dip.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.
howard_wolowitz I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.
raj_koothrappali Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.
howard_wolowitz There you go again.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?
howard_wolowitz Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.
raj_koothrappali How could you say that?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.
raj_koothrappali I never said that.
howard_wolowitz Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
raj_koothrappali Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s going on with him?
penny Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.
sheldon_cooper Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.
penny Don’t worry, he’ll come around.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I get why he’s annoyed.
sheldon_cooper Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.
leonard_hofstadter You love The Simpsons.
sheldon_cooper I love Lisa Simpson.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.
sheldon_cooper Wait. You were pretending?
amy_farrah_fowler Sorry.
sheldon_cooper No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.
sheldon_cooper Hmm, what do you think?
penny You don’t know?
raj_koothrappali Hey, did I say something to upset you?
howard_wolowitz No, I’m fine.
raj_koothrappali Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.
howard_wolowitz Just drop it.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.
howard_wolowitz Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?
raj_koothrappali It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.
penny Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.
sheldon_cooper Gladly.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.
sheldon_cooper It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.
howard_wolowitz Wait, what is going on?
penny Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you guys want to watch with us?
howard_wolowitz As long as I don’t have to watch with him.
raj_koothrappali Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.
howard_wolowitz Why do you get to pick?
raj_koothrappali Okay, then you go there.
howard_wolowitz Don’t tell me where to go.
leonard_hofstadter Howard, just come in here.
penny Yeah, come on, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
sheldon_cooper She did.
howard_wolowitz And I’m gonna eat it all.
howard_wolowitz So what the hell happened?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.
howard_wolowitz Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.
howard_wolowitz Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.
leonard_hofstadter If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly. Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.
stuart_bloom Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Stuart.
stuart_bloom Uh, is this not a dress-up party?
leonard_hofstadter No.
stuart_bloom Was it ever a dress-up party?
leonard_hofstadter No.
stuart_bloom Howard, didn’t you tell me it was a dress-up party?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
stuart_bloom I was told this is where to go if I’m mad at Howard.
penny May I take your cloak?
stuart_bloom Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.
stuart_bloom So what happened with you and Howard?
raj_koothrappali Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.
stuart_bloom I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.
leonard_hofstadter Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.
amy_farrah_fowler Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?
leonard_hofstadter Penny, but…
amy_farrah_fowler Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?
leonard_hofstadter I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
leonard_hofstadter Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I like the pain of others.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.
howard_wolowitz No, she doesn’t.
leonard_hofstadter She defends him all the time.
howard_wolowitz She does not.
amy_farrah_fowler Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
howard_wolowitz Well, she did. And human resources.
leonard_hofstadter Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch.
leonard_hofstadter You’re, you’re right, it feels good.
raj_koothrappali All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?
stuart_bloom Two women, huh?
sheldon_cooper Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses.
penny What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.
penny Where’d you get that from?
leonard_hofstadter From Amy.
penny Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?
amy_farrah_fowler Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
penny I don’t always defend Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.
penny What about your weird relationship with him?
leonard_hofstadter That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.
howard_wolowitz Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think so. Why?
howard_wolowitz Well just a feeling.
leonard_hofstadter It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
sheldon_cooper Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s gonna be okay.
sheldon_cooper Now it’s a fun fact.
stuart_bloom Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why are you dressed like that?
stuart_bloom Oh, uh, Howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.
bernadette_rostenkowski That wasn’t nice.
stuart_bloom No, but he almost died, so we’re cool.
raj_koothrappali You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.
amy_farrah_fowler How?
raj_koothrappali Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
penny Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.
raj_koothrappali Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.
sheldon_cooper Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
raj_koothrappali Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex.
penny There you go.
leonard_hofstadter That’s true.
sheldon_cooper Fair enough.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski You all right?
howard_wolowitz I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s get out of here.
amy_farrah_fowler That was scary.
sheldon_cooper Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?
stuart_bloom How come your head has your face on it?
sheldon_cooper They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.
stuart_bloom Don’t you guys have anything better to do?
leonard_hofstadter Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.
stuart_bloom That’s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!
sheldon_cooper Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I never got to ask my question about Batman.
leonard_hofstadter What is it?
sheldon_cooper If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?
penny Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
sheldon_cooper I’ll be back.
