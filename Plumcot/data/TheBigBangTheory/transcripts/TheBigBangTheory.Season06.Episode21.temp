sheldon Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?
penny No.
sheldon Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later.
penny Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can’t afford another demerit.
leonard Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.
leonard I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.
sheldon I’m deleting it.
penny Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it yet.
leonard You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.
sheldon No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.
leonard There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
sheldon Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.
leonard They did.
penny Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?
sheldon Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?
penny As a rule, no.
sheldon That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened.
penny Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?
sheldon Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.
leonard Oh, please, don’t do that.
sheldon No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
penny I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
leonard Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel.
howard I think you’re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out.
raj Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work, right?
howard Why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.
raj Wait, hold on. This is weird.
howard What?
raj I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her blog.
howard Cool. Anything juicy?
raj She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist, too?
howard You know what’s going on, don’t you?
raj Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.
howard I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.
raj Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.
howard Keep reading. What does it say?
raj No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m reading her diary.
howard It’s exactly what it’s like. Keep reading.
raj No, this is creepy.
howard Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.
raj It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh, look who’s got the sweetest kisses.
howard Should I go?
leonard With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?
penny It’s six thirty in the morning.
leonard I thought you grew up on a farm.
sheldon Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?
amy I’m sorry you’re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.
sheldon I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
amy Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.
sheldon Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.
amy You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.
sheldon Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with closure.
amy You sure about that?
sheldon Oh, quite sure. That proves nothing.
howard Ready to go to lunch?
raj Do you think I’m feminine?
howard Yeah. Let’s go.
raj Thanks a lot.
howard What’s going on?
raj I broke down, and I read Lucy’s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.
howard Just a little? That’s great.
raj I have to talk to her about this.
howard Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.
raj Well, that doesn’t seem fair.
howard Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?
raj No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.
howard So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
raj Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
howard The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
raj I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.
leonard So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.
penny It was cute.
leonard Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.
penny What’s wrong with cute?
leonard It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.
penny So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
leonard You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.
penny I liked it. I’m excited.
leonard Well, then, tell your face.
penny What do you want from me?
leonard You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.
penny Oh, come on, don’t be like that.
leonard Well…
penny I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.
leonard Really?
penny Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.
leonard All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.
penny Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.
amy I’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
sheldon I take issue with the word compulsive.
amy All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op…
sheldon …tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?
amy I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming.
sheldon By playing tic-tac-toe?
amy Yep. Your turn.
sheldon Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win. B-But we didn’t finish.
amy Exactly. How does that make you feel?
sheldon The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
amy And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
sheldon Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.
amy Come on, you can do this.
sheldon You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
amy Yeah, sounds like a drag.
penny Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?
bernadette Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?
penny Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it.
bernadette Why does this bother you so much?
penny I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?
bernadette Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.
penny See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.
bernadette Well, there’s no reason you can’t.
penny You think?
bernadette Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you’re passionate about.
penny Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.
howard Hey, what’s up?
raj Uh, Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice.
howard However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.
raj Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
howard I don’t know. Go with hockey.
raj Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that’s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.
lucy Hi.
raj Come in.
lucy Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.
raj Yeah, well, I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she’ll rip your face off.
1_amy O’er the land of the free, and the home of the… Next.
2_amy That’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?
sheldon Yes.
amy Let’s box it up.
sheldon Let’s box it up.
3_amy That’s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!
4_amy Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can’t come true.
sheldon Lucky for you, ’cause I wished you were dead.
lucy I like your jersey.
raj Thanks. I love hockey.
lucy Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who’s your favourite player?
raj Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?
lucy It’s still a little frozen in the middle.
raj Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.
lucy Is something going on?
raj What do you mean?
lucy Well, you’re acting all weird, and I’m pretty weird, so I think I know what I’m talking about.
raj I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been taking.
lucy I think I’m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.
raj Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.
lucy Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn’t think anybody actually read it.
raj No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.
lucy Why were you acting so strange tonight?
raj You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.
lucy Raj, I didn’t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.
raj I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
lucy So, are you okay?
raj Yeah.
lucy Good. Do you even like hockey?
raj No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
penny So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.
leonard The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.
penny See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.
leonard Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.
penny No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited about.
leonard Those things can still happen.
penny Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.
leonard That’s a big deal.
penny It is, isn’t it?
leonard So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?
penny Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.
sheldon Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.
amy I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
sheldon Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…
amy And?
sheldon Doesn’t matter, does it?
amy I’m proud of you, Sheldon.
sheldon And a complete sucker.
1_sheldon Oh, yeah.
3_sheldon There he is.
4_sheldon And the home of the brave.
5_sheldon Don’t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.
penny Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you’re in my life.
sheldon I love you, too.
sheldon Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.
