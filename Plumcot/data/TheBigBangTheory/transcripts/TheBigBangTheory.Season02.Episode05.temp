sheldon Good morning, Leonard.
leonard Uh-huh.
sheldon Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
leonard I’m not going to work.
sheldon Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up.
leonard Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
sheldon Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
leonard No.
sheldon Then you can drive. Let’s go.
leonard Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements.
sheldon You did.
leonard And?
sheldon I didn’t. Let’s go.
leonard Goodnight, Sheldon.
sheldon But how am I going to get to work?
leonard Take the bus.
sheldon I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
leonard You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
sheldon I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
leonard Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.
sheldon Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny…
penny Sheldon, what is it?
sheldon Leonard’s asleep.
penny Thanks for the update
sheldon No, wait. You have to drive me to work.
penny Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do.
sheldon But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.
penny Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?
sheldon Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
penny Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
sheldon Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
penny Oh, dear God.
sheldon I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.
sheldon Thank you for driving me to work.
penny You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.
penny Mm-hmm.
sheldon Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.
penny It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.
sheldon Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.
penny Sheldon, it’s fine.
sheldon If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine.
penny Uh, maybe the light’s broken.
sheldon Is there a “check the check engine light light”? O-o-o-oh!
penny What?
sheldon Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
penny Do you have any alcohol?
sheldon Of course not.
penny Too bad.
sheldon You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
penny Mm-hmm.
sheldon Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
penny Well, good for Leonard.
sheldon Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?
penny No.
sheldon The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?
penny No.
sheldon Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh. Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium,you say Manganese,and I say Europium,and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?
penny How about we just have a little quiet time now?
sheldon All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
penny Get out.
sheldon Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.
penny I said, get out.
sheldon Okay. I’ll give it a shot.
sheldon Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.
leonard I just got here.
sheldon Good, perfect timing.
leonard Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks.
sheldon No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work.
leonard Howard, help me out here.
howard No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.
sheldon Now, how do you propose I get home?
leonard How did you get here in the first place?
sheldon Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
leonard Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
howard Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.
sheldon Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
raj Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
sheldon We had a difference of opinion.
raj Over what?
sheldon Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?
raj I’m taking you home.
sheldon Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
raj I have a better idea.
sheldon You want to go to pottery barn first?
sheldon Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.
sheldon Good morning.
all Good morning.
leonard Sheldon, sit down.
sheldon She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.
penny Sheldon,you know that we care about you.
howard And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
penny You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.
leonard So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
sheldon Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
leonard Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.
howard This madness has to stop.
leonard Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed.
sheldon Why Penny?
leonard Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.
penny All right, come on Sheldon.
sheldon Hold on, I have one condition.
penny What?
sheldon We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
penny Okay.
sheldon And Radio Shack.
penny Fine.
sheldon And the comic book store.
penny All right!
howard Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store.
raj I like comic books.
sheldon I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license.
howard Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.
penny Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
sheldon I was otherwise engaged.
penny Doing what?
sheldon Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
penny Well, how ’bout when you were 17?
dmv_lady Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! Application?
sheldon I’m actually more of a theorist.
howard The application in your hand, give it to her.
sheldon Oh.
dmv_lady Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!
sheldon Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
dmv_lady Look at that sign up there.
sheldon Yes?
dmv_lady Does it say I give a damn?
sheldon No.
dmv_lady That’s because I don’t.
sheldon Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.
dmv_lady Look at the sign.
penny Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.
sheldon I don’t need your help, Penny.
dmv_lady Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!
sheldon No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.
howard Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?
sheldon How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.
dmv_lady Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.
sheldon But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
dmv_lady Don’t make me climb over this counter.
penny Come on, let’s go.
dmv_lady Next!
sheldon Aced it.
howard Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up.
leonard Booting.
howard This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
sheldon Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
howard I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see…
sheldon Ooh!
leonard No.
howard Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
sheldon Hmmmm?
howard What?
sheldon Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz.
howard Fine, what colour do you want?
sheldon You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?
howard Black it is.
leonard Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
sheldon I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
leonard Okay, fasten your seat belt.
sheldon Click. Now, are there air bags?
leonard You don’t need air bags.
sheldon What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
penny I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
leonard Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.
penny Oh.
leonard Oh.
howard Oh.
leonard Watch out.
howard Oh God!
leonard Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
penny Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
sheldon Thank you.
sheldon Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
leonard How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
sheldon I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.
leonard Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
sheldon No. I quit.
leonard Aw, the pet store?
sheldon Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed.
leonard So wait,you’re just gonna give up?
sheldon No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.
leonard So what is it you’re doing?
sheldon I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
leonard What does that mean?
sheldon Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
leonard I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
sheldon Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.
leonard No kidding.
sheldon Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.
leonard Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
sheldon No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
leonard It’s never safe.
sheldon Yeah, well, I know that now.
leonard Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
sheldon Homo Novus doesn’t know.
leonard Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.
sheldon Good morning, gentlemen.
leonard Hey.
raj Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
leonard No, he lives here now.
howard Really? Why?
leonard Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment.
raj But you finished your experiment a week ago.
leonard Yep
cleaning_lady_1 Oh my God, again?
cleaning_lady_2 It must be rats.
cleaning_lady_1 Rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust.
sheldon You saw nothing!
