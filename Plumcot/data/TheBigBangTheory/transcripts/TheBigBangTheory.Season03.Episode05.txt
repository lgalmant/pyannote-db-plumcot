howard_wolowitz All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em.
penny Um, I have a question.
leonard_hofstadter Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.
howard_wolowitz Unless you have the carrot power.
penny Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?
howard_wolowitz Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
leonard_hofstadter Just play a potion card.
penny Which one?
sheldon_cooper It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, don’t ruin the game.
penny How could he ruin the game?
sheldon_cooper Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.
leonard_hofstadter See? Ruined.
penny Sheldon, that is incredible.
sheldon_cooper From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
sheldon_cooper Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
howard_wolowitz Well, I guess game’s over.
penny Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
penny Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
howard_wolowitz Not Ka. Ka-ah.
penny Ba-eye.
leonard_hofstadter See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
raj_koothrappali Nobody can.
howard_wolowitz That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I don’t remember that.
sheldon_cooper June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah.
howard_wolowitz So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?
leonard_hofstadter Howard, you can’t hold me to that.
howard_wolowitz Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.
raj_koothrappali Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?
sheldon_cooper You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
raj_koothrappali Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works.
raj_koothrappali Damn.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, no.
leonard_hofstadter But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today. Good luck. That’s the face napkin.
howard_wolowitz So, have you talked to Penny yet?
leonard_hofstadter No, I haven’t.
howard_wolowitz Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?
howard_wolowitz Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.
raj_koothrappali It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, come on.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
howard_wolowitz A hot friend.
leonard_hofstadter Right.
howard_wolowitz And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll see what I can do.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?
sheldon_cooper I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.
raj_koothrappali Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
sheldon_cooper That would probably save us some time.
raj_koothrappali Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
raj_koothrappali What about the money?
sheldon_cooper I have money.
raj_koothrappali But this is other money.
sheldon_cooper How does it different from the money I have?
raj_koothrappali Half of it will be mine.
sheldon_cooper Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
raj_koothrappali Leonard, help.
leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
penny Wow, you really are a genius.
leonard_hofstadter Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?
penny You mean, like a pinky swear?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.
penny Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.
penny Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.
leonard_hofstadter Over puppets?
penny The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
penny Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
penny And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…
penny I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy.
penny The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.
leonard_hofstadter Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
penny Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
sheldon_cooper Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
stuart_bloom Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine’s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?
sheldon_cooper Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
stuart_bloom All right, I won’t set one aside for you.
sheldon_cooper But I must have it.
stuart_bloom Okay, I’ll set one aside for you.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
stuart_bloom Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
stuart_bloom Oh, I’m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
sheldon_cooper You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
raj_koothrappali Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.
sheldon_cooper I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
sheldon_cooper My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
raj_koothrappali Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
sheldon_cooper It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
raj_koothrappali Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here.
sheldon_cooper In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.
raj_koothrappali No doubt, sign here.
sheldon_cooper From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.
stuart_bloom All right, Raj, looks like you’re teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.
howard_wolowitz So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.
penny She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her.
howard_wolowitz Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
penny No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.
howard_wolowitz Good, good.
penny I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…
howard_wolowitz Six if you count Klingon.
leonard_hofstadter Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?
penny Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
howard_wolowitz What?
penny I’m kidding.
leonard_hofstadter Another delightful surprise for her.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
raj_koothrappali Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!
sheldon_cooper Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!
raj_koothrappali You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.
sheldon_cooper Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
raj_koothrappali Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship.
sheldon_cooper So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.
raj_koothrappali Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame.
sheldon_cooper Silence!
howard_wolowitz So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you studying?
bernadette_rostenkowski Microbiology.
howard_wolowitz Oh, cool. So you could study me.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t understand.
howard_wolowitz Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know, I’m studying it.
howard_wolowitz And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living thing. It’s a joke.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you sure?
howard_wolowitz Do you like science-fiction?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
howard_wolowitz Role-playing games?
bernadette_rostenkowski Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
howard_wolowitz Either.
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
leonard_hofstadter Gonna be a long night.
penny Yeah, well, it’s your fault.
leonard_hofstadter I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
howard_wolowitz You like magic?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not really.
howard_wolowitz Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Long, long night.
sheldon_cooper I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’
wil_wheaton Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?
stuart_bloom I believe so.
wil_wheaton What is wrong with him?
stuart_bloom Everyone has a different theory.
howard_wolowitz How about computers? Do you like computers?
bernadette_rostenkowski I use them. I don’t like them.
howard_wolowitz Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
bernadette_rostenkowski A puppy once bit my face.
howard_wolowitz Of course it did.
leonard_hofstadter How about that? Einstein was wrong.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
howard_wolowitz Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you going to answer it?
howard_wolowitz I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
howard_wolowitz Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?
howard_wolowitz My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?
howard_wolowitz You live with your mother?
bernadette_rostenkowski No. That’s the sad part.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
howard_wolowitz Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
howard_wolowitz Corolla!
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh!
howard_wolowitz More wine?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’d love some.
howard_wolowitz Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why?
howard_wolowitz A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
howard_wolowitz It’s a date.
penny Am I a matchmaker or what?
raj_koothrappali Lava serpent.
stuart_bloom Nest of snakes.
wil_wheaton Underworld guardian.
sheldon_cooper Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
wil_wheaton Invisibility spell.
sheldon_cooper Luminescence spell.
wil_wheaton Water nymph.
sheldon_cooper Fire demon.
wil_wheaton Two-headed tiger.
sheldon_cooper Three-headed lion.
wil_wheaton Sulphur.
sheldon_cooper Brimstone.
raj_koothrappali Problem, Wil Wheaton?
wil_wheaton Hang on.
sheldon_cooper You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.
wil_wheaton I think he’s got me.
sheldon_cooper The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.
wil_wheaton What?
sheldon_cooper You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.
wil_wheaton You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.
sheldon_cooper Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
wil_wheaton Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I disappointed you.
sheldon_cooper No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.
wil_wheaton It’s special relationship, isn’t it, between a boy and his grandmother?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes.
raj_koothrappali Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!
wil_wheaton It’s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.
raj_koothrappali What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart, stab at him!
sheldon_cooper I can’t.
raj_koothrappali Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
sheldon_cooper No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
raj_koothrappali No! Not enchanted bunny!
wil_wheaton I call my mee-maw nana. And she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.
sheldon_cooper I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
wil_wheaton Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let’s get our prize money.
stuart_bloom That was fun.
sheldon_cooper Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
