penny Hey.
leonard Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?
penny Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
leonard Not really.
penny Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
leonard Star Wars on Blu-ray.
penny Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?
leonard Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
penny Oh, Leonard.
leonard I know, it’s high-resolution sadness.
penny Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?
leonard Really? Do we do that?
penny What do you mean?
leonard You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up.
penny Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.
leonard Sounds like most of my dates.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!
penny What is that about?
leonard Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.
sheldon Shoo, shoo! Be gone!
leonard What the hell is going on?
sheldon There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.
penny Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?
sheldon It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.
penny So movies, yes or no?
leonard Movies, yes.
penny Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him.
sheldon That doesn’t help.
penny No, I was talking to the bird.
sheldon Go away, bird. Go away, bird. Go away, bird.
leonard Sheldon, just ignore him.
sheldon Good idea. Attention is what birds want. Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life. Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night.
leonard The bird’s still there?
sheldon Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
leonard I don’t know. Scree-scree.
sheldon Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help.
leonard Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?
sheldon It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins.
leonard I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.
sheldon Do you think it’s a date?
leonard No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t.
sheldon Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
leonard Are we overthinking this?
sheldon Not at all.
leonard You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.
sheldon Really? A blazer? All right. Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?
leonard Too casual?
sheldon For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. What am I thinking? Whiskers!
penny Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.
leonard Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.
penny Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam.
leonard Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.
penny Okay.
leonard Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.
penny You pick plenty of movies.
leonard No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.
penny But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.
leonard I hate those movies.
penny No, you don’t.
leonard Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.
penny Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?
leonard All the time.
penny You’re kidding.
leonard Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?
penny Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.
leonard Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
penny No. No woman would.
leonard See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.
penny All right, fine.
leonard Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
raj Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.
howard I’m pushing play.
sheldon A minute.
howard If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.
sheldon This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
howard I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
sheldon Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important.
raj I really don’t get your problem with birds.
sheldon The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.
raj Hummingbirds are pretty.
sheldon Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
raj Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.
sheldon Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?
raj Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.
howard All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.
sheldon It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one.
raj That is one tough birdie.
leonard Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.
penny No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t.
leonard I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?
penny Uh, no, thanks.
leonard Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.
penny I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
leonard No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?
penny To get sex.
leonard Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?
penny All right, I’d like an order of fries.
leonard Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.
penny Oh, sorry.
man No problem.
penny What you writing there?
man A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.
man It’s a working title.
penny Oh.
man I’m Kevin.
penny Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
kevin I’ll let you get back to your date.
penny Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?
leonard Uh, right.
penny So have you written anything I might have seen?
kevin That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?
sheldon This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay. That’s a pretty big blue jay. One, two, three. Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! No!
penny So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.
leonard You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
penny Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?
kevin No problem.
penny What’s up?
leonard I know what you’re doing.
penny What am I doing?
leonard You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.
penny No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.
leonard Come on, he’s not that cute.
penny Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.
leonard I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
penny Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically.
leonard If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?
penny You should.
leonard I’m serious. I’ll do it.
penny Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
leonard They’re in a group. I’m scared.
amy Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?
sheldon You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking.
bernadette I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.
amy Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.
sheldon Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.
bernadette Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.
sheldon No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!
bernadette Oh, he’s a sweetie.
sheldon Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.
amy Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.
sheldon Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.
bernadette Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!
sheldon I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.
woman So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?
leonard Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.
penny Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
leonard No, it’s fine. You can ditch away.
penny Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out.
leonard It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.
penny Oh, he had to leave.
leonard Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me.
woman This must be Penny.
leonard Yep.
woman I totally get it.
penny Huh? I’m sorry, get what?
leonard Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.
penny No, no. I want to know what you told her.
leonard That’s kind of between me and…
woman Laura.
leonard Laura.
penny Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?
laura Really?
penny Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
leonard Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.
penny Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…
laura Laura.
penny Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
leonard When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?
penny Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
leonard Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.
penny A… S… Take me home.
leonard Maybe I’m not done hanging out with… You’re right, it’s getting late.
sheldon It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage.
bernadette Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.
sheldon My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?
amy Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
bernadette I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
sheldon Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.
amy If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.
sheldon Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD? No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.
amy I’m sorry, Sheldon.
sheldon How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!
leonard Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.
penny Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.
leonard I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.
penny All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.
leonard Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?
penny Way off.
leonard Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
penny I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.
leonard Really?
penny Yeah.
leonard Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?
penny Ooh. Maybe I like it.
leonard You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be.
penny Good night, Leonard.
leonard I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
sheldon Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy.
