sheldon It’s an outrage.
leonard I know.
sheldon The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.
leonard You need to let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.
leonard Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days.
sheldon But I don’t want a vacation.
leonard Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.
sheldon Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?
leonard It doesn’t.
sheldon Thank you.
leonard I’m gonna go talk to Penny.
sheldon I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. Penny. Sorry.
penny Hi.
leonard Hey.
penny Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.
leonard Okay.
penny Yeah. Come in.
leonard Look, if you want to break up, just say it.
penny Leonard…
leonard No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.
penny Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.
leonard Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?
penny Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.
leonard Yeah.
penny Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.
leonard Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.
penny Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.
leonard Wow. That, that’s a big step.
penny I know.
leonard So, well, before making any rash…
penny I already quit.
leonard And I support you.
sheldon Come on, take me to work with you.
leonard No. You’re on vacation.
sheldon Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?
leonard Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
sheldon No. I was just tricking you.
leonard Bye.
sheldon Leonard, wait. Take me with you.
leonard No.
sheldon Please.
leonard No.
sheldon Too bad. I’m coming with you.
leonard Oh, Sheldon, stay.
sheldon But.
leonard I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.
bernadette Hey Stuart.
stuart Hey.
bernadette Sorry. Did I startle you?
stuart Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?
bernadette Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.
stuart Wow. What happened?
bernadette Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
stuart Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.
bernadette Do you have this one?
stuart Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?
bernadette Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.
stuart Oh. What’s the hurry?
bernadette Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.
stuart Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.
bernadette You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.
stuart Really? Do you have any of these?
amy Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?
howard Anybody home?
amy Hey, what brings you guys here?
raj Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.
amy Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.
bert Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company.
amy That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.
howard Hi.
raj Hey. Good to see you.
bert Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.
amy This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
bert Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?
howard You’re both into rock?
bert Yeah. Well, see ya.
amy Oh, you forgot your quartz.
bert Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.
amy He’s nice.
howard Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you.
amy What?! No, he doesn’t.
raj He brought you a pretty rock.
amy So? He does that every day. Oh.
howard You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay.
amy He’s not my boyfriend.
raj Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.
amy Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
raj Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.
amy What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.
howard Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?
amy I guess it hasn’t come up.
howard There you go.
raj And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?
amy I’m sorry. Who are you dating?
raj Yeah, knock it off, Howard.
penny Oh. Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello.
penny You okay?
sheldon I’m on vacation. What do you think?
penny Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
sheldon Leonard told me to stay.
penny Oh. Well, good boy.
sheldon Where are you going?
penny Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
sheldon Well, have fun.
penny Okay. You want to come with me?
sheldon Really?
penny Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.
stuart All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.
bernadette Oh, that’s great.
stuart No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.
bernadette Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?
stuart You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.
bernadette Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.
amy Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?
leonard Yeah.
howard So, what is she doing today?
leonard I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.
raj Well, do you support this?
leonard Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.
amy That’s nice.
leonard You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
penny Hi. What’s up?
leonard Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?
penny Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.
leonard You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.
penny Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.
leonard And I support you.
voice Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.
sheldon Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.
voice Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.
sheldon Wow. Didn’t see that coming.
voice In.
sheldon Let me guess.
voice And out.
sheldon What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?
penny I didn’t get it.
sheldon A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.
penny Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
sheldon Do you see me drinking lemonade?
penny No. I’m serious.
sheldon Why do you ask?
penny Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
sheldon No, I don’t think you are.
penny Really?
sheldon The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.
penny Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?
sheldon Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers.
penny Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.
bert Hey.
amy Hello, Bert.
bert So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.
amy Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.
bert Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.
amy Weren’t you?
bert Yeah.
amy That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.
bert That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.
amy No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.
bert Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.
amy Don’t say that.
bert It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.
amy No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.
bert Sweet. It’s a date.
amy No, it’s not.
bert Too late.
bernadette Wow.
stuart Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.
jesse Hey, Stuart.
stuart Jesse.
jesse Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.
stuart My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.
jesse No, I was talking about your skin.
stuart Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.
jesse Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.
stuart Even you, Sweatpants?
sweatpants Free popcorn.
jesse Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?
bernadette No, thanks.
jesse How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?
bernadette Hey.
jesse I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.
stuart It’s on Merton Avenue.
bernadette I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.
jesse Sorry. You want the book or not?
bernadette Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.
stuart You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.
jesse What’s that?
stuart Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.
howard The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.
amy So what am I supposed to do now?
raj Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
amy This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.
howard Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.
raj Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.
howard Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.
raj Megan Pincus.
howard Tammy Cho.
raj Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?
howard Arlene Russel.
raj Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
howard Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
amy Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?
raj I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.
howard That’s how you reject a guy.
amy Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.
howard No, don’t.
raj He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
howard You want us to talk to him?
amy Really? You would do that?
raj Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
amy Thank you.
howard Let’s go.
raj So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?
howard Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.
penny And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.
sheldon I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
penny Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.
sheldon Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
leonard Oh, hey.
penny And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
leonard How did she get you to do yoga?
sheldon Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.
penny I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.
leonard Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.
penny Sheldon, take a break.
sheldon Namaste.
penny Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?
leonard Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?
penny Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
leonard Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.
penny Yeah, well, maybe we do.
sheldon I’m willing to if you guys are.
leonard Can we please have some privacy?
sheldon Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?
leonard No.
sheldon Penny?
penny Okay, wait. What are we doing?
leonard For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.
sheldon Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.
penny Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.
sheldon Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.
leonard I swear, I am on your side.
penny You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.
sheldon He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?
leonard Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.
penny Well, it’s scary for me, too.
sheldon I’m fine with it.
leonard My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you.
penny Okay. Thank you.
sheldon Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.
jesse You’re back.
bernadette Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.
jesse No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?
bernadette No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.
jesse I only have chocolate chip.
bernadette Well, that sounds even better.
bert Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.
raj We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.
howard Really, really sorry.
bert Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!
