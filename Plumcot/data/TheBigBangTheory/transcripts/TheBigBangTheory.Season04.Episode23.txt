penny Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.
bernadette_rostenkowski You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
penny Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
penny Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, that’s my water.
sheldon_cooper What?
leonard_hofstadter My water. You’re drinking it.
sheldon_cooper Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. It’s my water.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s it then. I’m dead.
leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.
bernadette_rostenkowski You guys ready to order?
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t understand.
howard_wolowitz He drank from Leonard’s glass.
sheldon_cooper He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
leonard_hofstadter That’s actually my napkin.
sheldon_cooper Oh, this is a nightmare!
howard_wolowitz Where are you going?
sheldon_cooper To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!
bernadette_rostenkowski All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.
priya_koothrappali Is it diet?
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s what you ordered.
priya_koothrappali Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
howard_wolowitz Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
leonard_hofstadter What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
bernadette_rostenkowski He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.
howard_wolowitz I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
priya_koothrappali Howard, you’ve got to tell your mother.
howard_wolowitz Hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?
priya_koothrappali Uh, that’s different. First of all, we’re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.
howard_wolowitz Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
sheldon_cooper I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
leonard_hofstadter You all right?
sheldon_cooper Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
sheldon_cooper Fire demon.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.
howard_wolowitz Troll master.
raj_koothrappali Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
leonard_hofstadter Water nymph.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places.
sheldon_cooper Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
raj_koothrappali Sorry. Walking tree.
sheldon_cooper Last one.
raj_koothrappali I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
howard_wolowitz Okay, the Eagle has landed.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
howard_wolowitz Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
raj_koothrappali Oh, that sounds lovely.
howard_wolowitz Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.
leonard_hofstadter Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
howard_wolowitz You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, that’s my water.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord!
leonard_hofstadter That’s not your water.
raj_koothrappali I know.
sheldon_cooper Where’s the mouthwash?
raj_koothrappali Where indeed.
howard_wolowitz Ma, I’m home! Where are you?
debbie_wolowitz I’m in the toilet.
howard_wolowitz So, how’d it go?
debbie_wolowitz Too soon to say. I’m not done yet.
howard_wolowitz No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.
debbie_wolowitz Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that’s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.
howard_wolowitz Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?
debbie_wolowitz Oh, sure. Did you know she’s going to school to become a microbiologist?
howard_wolowitz No, she never mentioned it.
debbie_wolowitz I bet she did and you didn’t listen.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, that’s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She’s great, huh?
debbie_wolowitz She’s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
howard_wolowitz That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news.
debbie_wolowitz I hope it’s good news, because I’ve got nothing but disappointment in here!
howard_wolowitz Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma? Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I’m gonna break the door down! Son of a bitch! Ma, help!
penny Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?
sheldon_cooper Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. Did I say something amusing?
penny I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.
sheldon_cooper So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
penny My mirth. Classic.
sheldon_cooper Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
penny It’s not a big deal, Sheldon. It’s just, ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister, I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
sheldon_cooper Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
penny What are you doing at work these days?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.
penny Alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber.
sheldon_cooper Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?
penny Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.
leonard_hofstadter Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.
penny Oh, my God! What happened?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let’s go!
sheldon_cooper To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so.
penny Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going.
sheldon_cooper I can’t.
penny Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs.
sheldon_cooper Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.
leonard_hofstadter Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.
sheldon_cooper I would think he would know that.
penny Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.
sheldon_cooper Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel.
howard_wolowitz So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re a real hero, Howard.
howard_wolowitz No, I did what any son would do.
penny Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.
howard_wolowitz I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
penny Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car.
howard_wolowitz What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.
leonard_hofstadter So, how is she?
howard_wolowitz They’re running tests. I don’t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
penny What’s the difference?
sheldon_cooper A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
penny Thanks for clearing that up.
sheldon_cooper Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.
penny Okay, you’re not helping.
sheldon_cooper Disagree.
leonard_hofstadter Go sit over there.
sheldon_cooper I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner.
leonard_hofstadter Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
howard_wolowitz My family is the history of heart disease. There’s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .
bernadette_rostenkowski So it’s probably genetic.
howard_wolowitz Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz It’s not important.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.
howard_wolowitz You’d think that. But no.
bernadette_rostenkowski You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
howard_wolowitz You can’t take that personally.
penny How else is she supposed to take it?
howard_wolowitz What you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I’ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t.
bernadette_rostenkowski You mean sexual intercourse?
howard_wolowitz Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.
priya_koothrappali What happened?
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.
howard_wolowitz Bernie, wait!
sheldon_cooper I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home.
priya_koothrappali Nice of you to come for Howard.
penny Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do.
priya_koothrappali I’m sorry, did I miss something?
penny It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.
priya_koothrappali That’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend.
penny Yeah, tell me about it.
priya_koothrappali You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.
penny You mean when he was little.
priya_koothrappali Not as little as you’d want him to be.
penny You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?
priya_koothrappali Sure. We’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?
leonard_hofstadter I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
raj_koothrappali Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
raj_koothrappali One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
raj_koothrappali Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
leonard_hofstadter No, I do not. You are a mean little man.
raj_koothrappali You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.
howard_wolowitz Bernie, it’s not you. She’s just set in her ways.
bernadette_rostenkowski How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
howard_wolowitz It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.
sheldon_cooper Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong with the bathroom here?
sheldon_cooper Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I’m not taking you home.
sheldon_cooper Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?
howard_wolowitz No!
sheldon_cooper This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!
dr_bernstein Mr. Wolowitz?
howard_wolowitz Is she okay?
dr_bernstein It wasn’t a heart attack. She’s awake, she’s resting comfortably. We’re still running a few tests.
howard_wolowitz Can I see her?
dr_bernstein Actually, she said, and I quote, she’d like to see the little Catholic girl first.
bernadette_rostenkowski Me? Why me?
howard_wolowitz Jews have been asking that for centuries. There’s no real good answer.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, well, wish me luck.
howard_wolowitz Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Let’s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.
dr_bernstein You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
dr_bernstein Why don’t I write you a prescription for Xanax.
sheldon_cooper Finally. Oh, what fresh hell is this?
dr_bernstein Wait, you can’t leave here, you’ve been exposed.
sheldon_cooper No, I haven’t. It’s all good.
penny You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up.
priya_koothrappali Oh, the poor thing.
penny It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
priya_koothrappali It does, doesn’t it?
penny It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.
sheldon_cooper Help me! Come back! Penny!
leonard_hofstadter There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…
raj_koothrappali Like what?
leonard_hofstadter Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her.
raj_koothrappali What do you mean, a show?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.
raj_koothrappali Like, to music?
leonard_hofstadter I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
raj_koothrappali So you’d do a striptease?
leonard_hofstadter I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
raj_koothrappali Good, good.
leonard_hofstadter There was one time I put body glitter on.
raj_koothrappali Well, I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
leonard_hofstadter No, she wouldn’t.
raj_koothrappali Your big problem is me telling her.
leonard_hofstadter You really are a mean little man.
priya_koothrappali Oh, God, that’s so true.
penny Yeah, I know, right?
leonard_hofstadter Hey, what took you guys so long?
priya_koothrappali Oh, we were just chatting.
leonard_hofstadter That’s nice. What about?
penny We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
leonard_hofstadter That’s funny.
penny Yeah.
raj_koothrappali What if she wasn’t kidding?
leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
howard_wolowitz Hey, how’d it go?
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re a putz. You know what that means?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Do you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
howard_wolowitz And are you?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.
howard_wolowitz Well, based on the available evid…
bernadette_rostenkowski Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
howard_wolowitz Where are you going?
bernadette_rostenkowski To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
howard_wolowitz Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?
sheldon_cooper Mountain Elf.
raj_koothrappali He takes the elf from off the shelf.
leonard_hofstadter Hell Hounds.
raj_koothrappali Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
howard_wolowitz Colossal Serpent.
raj_koothrappali I got a colossal serpent right here.
sheldon_cooper Must you?
raj_koothrappali Sorry, I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo.
sheldon_cooper Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.
howard_wolowitz If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.
