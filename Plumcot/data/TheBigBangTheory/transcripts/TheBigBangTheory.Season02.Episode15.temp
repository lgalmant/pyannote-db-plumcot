penny Fellas, please.
howard Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.
penny You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
leonard I’m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.
penny What’s that about?
howard Not a clue.
leonard Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
sheldon This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.
leonard No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
sheldon He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
leonard Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable.
sheldon Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.
leonard Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.
howard How about that, you were right.
penny It’s out of order.
woman Yes, I can read the sign, I’m just pondering the implications.
penny I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
woman Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.
penny You must be Leonard’s mother.
leonards_mother Oh, I don’t know if I must be, but yes.
penny Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.
leonards_mother Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.
penny Oh, nice to meet you.
beverley Oh, you’re a hand shaker. Interesting.
penny Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.
beverley Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?
penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
beverley All right, you start.
penny Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?
beverley Oh, I think you mean young. He’s always been little.
penny Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
beverley You’ll have to be more specific.
penny Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.
beverley Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.
penny Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
beverley Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.
penny Oh, well, I’m an actress.
beverley Why?
penny What do you mean why?
beverley Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.
penny Yeah, I don’t know what that means.
beverley Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.
penny Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
beverley Tell me about it.
penny I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!
beverley And then, I’m assuming, you entered adolescence.
penny Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!
beverley If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.
leonard Good to see you, Mother.
leonard Here’s your tea, Mother.
beverley Oolong?
leonard Yes.
beverley Loose, not bagged?
leonard Yes.
beverley Steeped three minutes?
leonard Yes.
beverley Two-percent milk?
leonard Yes.
beverley Warmed separately?
leonard Yes.
beverley One teaspoon sugar?
leonard Yes.
beverley Raw sugar?
leonard Yes.
beverley It’s cold.
leonard I’ll start again.
sheldon I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
sheldon That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
beverley Yes, we think so. We’ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.
sheldon Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
beverley Well, it’s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.
leonard Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
sheldon The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
leonard Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
beverley I’m sorry, it’s on my other laptop.
sheldon Aw…
leonard So, Mother, what’s new?
beverley You’ll have to be more specific.
leonard All right. Uh, what’s new with you?
beverley Oh, well, I’ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.
leonard Maybe something less personal.
beverley Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.
leonard Oh, my God. What happened?
beverley His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.
sheldon What a remarkable woman.
leonard Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
sheldon I envy you your childhood.
leonard I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
sheldon You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.
leonard Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
sheldon You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.
howard So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.
leonard Please, don’t go there, Howard.
howard I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields.
leonard Boy, you suck.
beverley Well, Leonard’s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.
howard So, she’s close to curing diabetes?
beverley Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?
howard Wow, you must be very proud.
beverley Why? They’re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.
leonard Why are you doing this?
howard You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.
sheldon Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
raj Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
howard Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.
leonard You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
raj Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.
howard Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?
leonard That was fast.
beverley Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I’ll have to try again later.
sheldon It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location.
beverley So, where were we?
leonard Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
beverley That’s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché.
howard It’s just temporary, I pay rent.
leonard He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
beverley You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.
howard Say what? That’s basically what I just said.
leonard You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
beverley Leonard, it’s one o’clock, weren’t you going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock?
leonard There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
beverley But it’s one o’clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock.
sheldon Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
leonard Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
beverley So, no original research?
leonard No.
beverley Well, what’s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.
howard Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.
raj Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?
howard Why is it always my responsibility?
raj It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
howard I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
raj I didn’t bring it up. You did.
howard We’ll talk about this later.
raj You always say that, but we never do.
sheldon You went to the comic book store without me.7
penny Hey.
leonard You got alcohol?
penny Your mom still here?
leonard Yep.
penny Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?
leonard Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
penny Oh, my God. What happened?
leonard Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
penny Geez, what a fun couple.
leonard She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
penny Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.
leonard You can’t let her get into your head.
penny My head, what about yours?
leonard It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
penny She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
leonard Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.
penny I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?
leonard Did you get the part?
penny No, they said I was too perky.
leonard Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
penny Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me.
leonard Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
penny A hugging machine?
leonard Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
penny Oh, that is so sad.
leonard You know what the saddest part was?
penny What?
leonard My father used to borrow it.
beverley Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.
sheldon I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
beverley Common complaint among men. Nothing’s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.
sheldon I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
beverley Oh, I’ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.
sheldon Oh, I can’t believe that.
beverley Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.
sheldon My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
beverley Understandable.
sheldon Can I make you a cup of tea?
beverley I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it’s probably you.
sheldon I feel very comfortable around you.
beverley I feel very comfortable around you, too.
sheldon It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.
beverley Nor I.
sheldon What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
beverley Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?
sheldon I’d like to do the math.
beverley I’d like that, too.
penny Okay, now this time…
leonard Uh-huh.
penny You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.
leonard I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.
penny Neck, shot, lime. Okay, shot, lime.
leonard Right. Ah! Where’s the lime? Oh, okay, we’re sharing.
sheldon So, what do you think?
beverley I’m very tempted. I’m just not sure it’s appropriate with my son’s roommate.
sheldon Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.
beverley True. I’ve had a similar observation. It’s certainly something I could never do with my husband.
sheldon I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.
beverley I see what you’re doing. You’re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.
sheldon You see right through me, don’t you?
beverley Only when you’re in a CAT scanner.
leonard This is actually gonna happen.
penny Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
leonard You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children.
penny Why would you bring that up right now?
leonard I don’t know. Foreplay?
penny So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?
leonard Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”
penny That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
leonard Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that.
penny Get out!
leonard She said shush. I should have shushed.
leonard All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.
beverley That’s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes
penny Oh, good morning.
leonard Morning.
penny Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.
leonard You don’t have to. Ever.
penny Gotcha.
leonard Good-bye, Mother.
beverley Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?
penny I mean, my mom could’ve just said, “Bob, get over it, she’s a girl, move on.” But she didn’t. Not one word.
beverley Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?
penny Would it help?
beverley Well, it would help me.
