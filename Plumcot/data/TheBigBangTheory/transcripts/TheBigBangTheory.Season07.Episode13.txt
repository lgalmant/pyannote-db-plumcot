sheldon_cooper It’s an outrage.
leonard_hofstadter I know.
sheldon_cooper The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.
leonard_hofstadter You need to let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days.
sheldon_cooper But I don’t want a vacation.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.
sheldon_cooper Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?
leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna go talk to Penny.
sheldon_cooper I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. Penny. Sorry.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
penny Yeah. Come in.
leonard_hofstadter Look, if you want to break up, just say it.
penny Leonard…
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.
penny Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?
penny Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.
penny Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. That, that’s a big step.
penny I know.
leonard_hofstadter So, well, before making any rash…
penny I already quit.
leonard_hofstadter And I support you.
sheldon_cooper Come on, take me to work with you.
leonard_hofstadter No. You’re on vacation.
sheldon_cooper Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?
leonard_hofstadter Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
sheldon_cooper No. I was just tricking you.
leonard_hofstadter Bye.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait. Take me with you.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Please.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Too bad. I’m coming with you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon, stay.
sheldon_cooper But.
leonard_hofstadter I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey Stuart.
stuart_bloom Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. Did I startle you?
stuart_bloom Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.
stuart_bloom Wow. What happened?
bernadette_rostenkowski Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
stuart_bloom Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you have this one?
stuart_bloom Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.
stuart_bloom Oh. What’s the hurry?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.
stuart_bloom Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.
stuart_bloom Really? Do you have any of these?
amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?
howard_wolowitz Anybody home?
amy_farrah_fowler Hey, what brings you guys here?
raj_koothrappali Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.
amy_farrah_fowler Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.
bert_kibbler Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
raj_koothrappali Hey. Good to see you.
bert_kibbler Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.
amy_farrah_fowler This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
bert_kibbler Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?
howard_wolowitz You’re both into rock?
bert_kibbler Yeah. Well, see ya.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you forgot your quartz.
bert_kibbler Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s nice.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you.
amy_farrah_fowler What?! No, he doesn’t.
raj_koothrappali He brought you a pretty rock.
amy_farrah_fowler So? He does that every day. Oh.
howard_wolowitz You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s not my boyfriend.
raj_koothrappali Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.
amy_farrah_fowler Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.
amy_farrah_fowler What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.
howard_wolowitz Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler I guess it hasn’t come up.
howard_wolowitz There you go.
raj_koothrappali And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry. Who are you dating?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, knock it off, Howard.
penny Oh. Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny You okay?
sheldon_cooper I’m on vacation. What do you think?
penny Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
sheldon_cooper Leonard told me to stay.
penny Oh. Well, good boy.
sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
penny Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
sheldon_cooper Well, have fun.
penny Okay. You want to come with me?
sheldon_cooper Really?
penny Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.
stuart_bloom All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s great.
stuart_bloom No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?
stuart_bloom You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
howard_wolowitz So, what is she doing today?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.
raj_koothrappali Well, do you support this?
leonard_hofstadter Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s nice.
leonard_hofstadter You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
penny Hi. What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?
penny Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.
leonard_hofstadter You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.
penny Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.
leonard_hofstadter And I support you.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.
sheldon_cooper Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.
sheldon_cooper Wow. Didn’t see that coming.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 In.
sheldon_cooper Let me guess.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 And out.
sheldon_cooper What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?
penny I didn’t get it.
sheldon_cooper A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.
penny Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
sheldon_cooper Do you see me drinking lemonade?
penny No. I’m serious.
sheldon_cooper Why do you ask?
penny Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
sheldon_cooper No, I don’t think you are.
penny Really?
sheldon_cooper The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.
penny Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?
sheldon_cooper Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers.
penny Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.
bert_kibbler Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Bert.
bert_kibbler So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.
amy_farrah_fowler Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.
bert_kibbler Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.
amy_farrah_fowler Weren’t you?
bert_kibbler Yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.
bert_kibbler That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.
amy_farrah_fowler No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.
bert_kibbler Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t say that.
bert_kibbler It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.
amy_farrah_fowler No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.
bert_kibbler Sweet. It’s a date.
amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s not.
bert_kibbler Too late.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wow.
stuart_bloom Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.
jesse Hey, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Jesse.
jesse Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.
stuart_bloom My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.
jesse No, I was talking about your skin.
stuart_bloom Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.
jesse Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.
stuart_bloom Even you, Sweatpants?
captain_sweatpants Free popcorn.
jesse Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, thanks.
jesse How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
jesse I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.
stuart_bloom It’s on Merton Avenue.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.
jesse Sorry. You want the book or not?
bernadette_rostenkowski Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.
stuart_bloom You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.
jesse What’s that?
stuart_bloom Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.
howard_wolowitz The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.
amy_farrah_fowler So what am I supposed to do now?
raj_koothrappali Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
amy_farrah_fowler This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.
howard_wolowitz Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.
raj_koothrappali Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.
howard_wolowitz Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.
raj_koothrappali Megan Pincus.
howard_wolowitz Tammy Cho.
raj_koothrappali Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?
howard_wolowitz Arlene Russel.
raj_koothrappali Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
howard_wolowitz Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?
raj_koothrappali I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.
howard_wolowitz That’s how you reject a guy.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.
howard_wolowitz No, don’t.
raj_koothrappali He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
howard_wolowitz You want us to talk to him?
amy_farrah_fowler Really? You would do that?
raj_koothrappali Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
howard_wolowitz Let’s go.
raj_koothrappali So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?
howard_wolowitz Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.
penny And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.
sheldon_cooper I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
penny Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.
sheldon_cooper Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
penny And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
leonard_hofstadter How did she get you to do yoga?
sheldon_cooper Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.
penny I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.
penny Sheldon, take a break.
sheldon_cooper Namaste.
penny Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?
leonard_hofstadter Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?
penny Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.
penny Yeah, well, maybe we do.
sheldon_cooper I’m willing to if you guys are.
leonard_hofstadter Can we please have some privacy?
sheldon_cooper Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Penny?
penny Okay, wait. What are we doing?
leonard_hofstadter For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.
sheldon_cooper Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.
penny Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.
leonard_hofstadter I swear, I am on your side.
penny You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.
sheldon_cooper He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?
leonard_hofstadter Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.
penny Well, it’s scary for me, too.
sheldon_cooper I’m fine with it.
leonard_hofstadter My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you.
penny Okay. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.
jesse You’re back.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.
jesse No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.
jesse I only have chocolate chip.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, that sounds even better.
bert_kibbler Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.
raj_koothrappali We’re sorry Amy didn’t want to go.
howard_wolowitz Really, really sorry.
bert_kibbler Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!
