sheldon_cooper Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?
amy_farrah_fowler I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
sheldon_cooper But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.
amy_farrah_fowler And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.
sheldon_cooper So as they say, all good things must come to an end.
amy_farrah_fowler After only 232 episodes.
sheldon_cooper 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
amy_farrah_fowler You said you weren’t gonna bring that up.
sheldon_cooper And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?
amy_farrah_fowler That was a good one.
sheldon_cooper It was so good.
raj_koothrappali You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.
howard_wolowitz Doesn’t Professor Abbott’s family want any of this stuff?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think he had a family.
raj_koothrappali That’s rough.
leonard_hofstadter I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box.
howard_wolowitz Makes you think. Oh, well.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important.
howard_wolowitz I did. It’s all outdated or disproved.
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.
leonard_hofstadter It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
howard_wolowitz Don’t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.
leonard_hofstadter That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.
howard_wolowitz That’s intense.
raj_koothrappali Poor Roger Abbott.
howard_wolowitz Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
raj_koothrappali Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.
dan Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.
penny Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine.
dan Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.
penny Aw.
dan Yes. Why don’t you come over to my table.
penny I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car.
dan Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.
penny Come on. She’s not that bad.
dan Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.
penny I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, what are you talking about?
penny Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?
sheldon_cooper Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.
amy_farrah_fowler And, yes, even shed a tear or two.
sheldon_cooper Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
amy_farrah_fowler How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
sheldon_cooper Crikey, what flag do we have today?
amy_farrah_fowler Australia, mate.
sheldon_cooper And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
barry_kripke Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.
amy_farrah_fowler Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?
sheldon_cooper I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
amy_farrah_fowler Then who did sew it, hmm?
sheldon_cooper Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
sheldon_cooper Fancy a dip, my dear?
amy_farrah_fowler I do.
sheldon_cooper Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.
amy_farrah_fowler Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
sheldon_cooper No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
barry_kripke Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.
raj_koothrappali When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?
howard_wolowitz Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?
raj_koothrappali Wrong, smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.
leonard_hofstadter Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
howard_wolowitz Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?
raj_koothrappali Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.
leonard_hofstadter This has to mean something.
howard_wolowitz Well, there’s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check.
leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.
howard_wolowitz Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.
raj_koothrappali Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
howard_wolowitz Oh, let’s do that.
leonard_hofstadter Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’m not even sure if it’s the right word.
penny So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?
dan Seven.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.
penny I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”
dan I need another drink.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s his problem?
penny Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.
penny Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.
bernadette_rostenkowski What? I’m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.
penny Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah? You one of those people?
penny No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.
amy_farrah_fowler Action.
sheldon_cooper Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.
levar_burton Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.
sheldon_cooper You do this, I delete your contact information.
levar_burton While?
sheldon_cooper While you watch me do it.
levar_burton Great. Happy to be back.
sheldon_cooper Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? Hi. My name is George.
levar_burton Oh, hell, no.
sheldon_cooper You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist.
howard_wolowitz Are we sure this is the place?
raj_koothrappali The doorman said this is the right building.
leonard_hofstadter I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 Who is it?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?
professor_sharpe Hold on. Can I help you?
leonard_hofstadter Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
howard_wolowitz We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
leonard_hofstadter Any chance you know what it is?
professor_sharpe Yes, he was always working on this.
raj_koothrappali I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
professor_sharpe It’s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That’s his food diary.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
professor_sharpe Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.
raj_koothrappali Does it work?
howard_wolowitz Seriously?
raj_koothrappali Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.
professor_sharpe Sorry it’s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.
leonard_hofstadter So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?
professor_sharpe To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.
raj_koothrappali You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.
raj_koothrappali Well, you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.
penny No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.
bernadette_rostenkowski I did say that, didn’t I?
penny Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.
bernadette_rostenkowski Where? To Babies R Us?
penny You’re doing it again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.
penny Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think I’d rather go.
penny No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
penny Even though your dress is ugly.
sheldon_cooper Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.
amy_farrah_fowler Take that, glass ceiling.
sheldon_cooper And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off, I’d, uh, I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night.
amy_farrah_fowler Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.
sheldon_cooper If you didn’t press record…
amy_farrah_fowler I pressed it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott.
raj_koothrappali And we still don’t know who framed him.
leonard_hofstadter I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
howard_wolowitz I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.
leonard_hofstadter That’s a nice way of looking at it.
howard_wolowitz Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I’m covered.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.
howard_wolowitz I love that.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, me, too.
leonard_hofstadter Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face.
raj_koothrappali Oh, well, that’s the best part.
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?
dan Sure, go ahead.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just want you to know I didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.
dan No, it’s okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not. Penny told me that everyone’s scared of me.
dan What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?
penny What?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.
dan Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I’ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.
bernadette_rostenkowski No problem. When does that start?
dan Five months ago.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
dan Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s been paying for my coffee?
dan All of us.
penny Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
bernadette_rostenkowski What else don’t I know about?
penny Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah?
penny That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re kidding.
dan No, no. It’s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she’s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.
bernadette_rostenkowski I feel so bad.
penny Well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster.
dan But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person.
dan Come on, don’t cry. It’s okay.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?
penny Because this company needs you.
dan It’s fine. We don’t mind paying for the coffee.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t let you do that.
dan Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess that would be all right.
penny See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter How come you’re up so late?
sheldon_cooper I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
sheldon_cooper It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all.
leonard_hofstadter Sad?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. What did they say?
sheldon_cooper Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.
leonard_hofstadter Congratulations.
sheldon_cooper Let’s celebrate.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, that wasn’t for you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.
sheldon_cooper LeVar Burton? LeVar Burton? LeVar Burton?
levar_burton Ugh. What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper You told me not to call, and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.
levar_burton Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don’t know why I didn’t get a gate.
sheldon_cooper You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk
