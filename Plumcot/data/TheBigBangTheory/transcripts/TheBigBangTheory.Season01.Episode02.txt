leonard_hofstadter There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.
howard_wolowitz But does it have peanut oil?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I'm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
sheldon_cooper Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.
raj_koothrappali Are there any chopsticks?
sheldon_cooper You don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.
leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
sheldon_cooper Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
leonard_hofstadter Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. I'll get it.
howard_wolowitz Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
penny Hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi Penny.
penny Am I interrupting.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper You're not swelling, Howard.
howard_wolowitz No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages.
penny Sounds like you have company.
leonard_hofstadter They're not going anywhere. So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work.
penny Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.
leonard_hofstadter So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.
penny Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was ...
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
penny Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so ... Oh! Hel ...hello!
penny I'm sorry?
howard_wolowitz Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
penny No, I haven't.
howard_wolowitz Get used to it.
penny Yeah, I probably won't, but ... Hey Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hi.
penny Hey Raj! Still not talking to me, huh?
sheldon_cooper Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.
howard_wolowitz He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake-scented Goddess!
leonard_hofstadter So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
penny Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no problem.
penny Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, wait.
penny Yeah?
leonard_hofstadter Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
penny A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
sheldon_cooper You're kidding, right?
penny Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?
howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter@sheldon_cooper One.
sheldon_cooper You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
penny Yes, I know, men can't fly.
sheldon_cooper Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.
leonard_hofstadter Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
sheldon_cooper In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
sheldon_cooper Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.
sheldon_cooper Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
penny I'm just going to go wash up.
leonard_hofstadter I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
sheldon_cooper Challenge accepted. We're locked out.
raj_koothrappali Also, the pretty girl left.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to oh, you're just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
sheldon_cooper I hardly think so.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
sheldon_cooper Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.
leonard_hofstadter We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter ... I don't have this ... I don't have this I don't have this.
sheldon_cooper Archimedes would be so proud.
leonard_hofstadter Do you have any ideas?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.
leonard_hofstadter Easy, easy Okay! Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.
sheldon_cooper Exactly half.
leonard_hofstadter Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math.
sheldon_cooper What's your formula for the corner.
leonard_hofstadter What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.
sheldon_cooper Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.
sheldon_cooper You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
leonard_hofstadter Men do things for women without expecting sex.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, those are men who just had sex.
leonard_hofstadter I'm doing this to be a good neighbor. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.
leonard_hofstadter Almost there, almost there, almost there.
sheldon_cooper No we're not, no we're not, no we're not.
sheldon_cooper Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!
leonard_hofstadter You okay?
sheldon_cooper No, it hurt ... Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place?
leonard_hofstadter So Penny's a little messy.
sheldon_cooper A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.
leonard_hofstadter Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, we should go.
sheldon_cooper Hang on.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Straightening up.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is not your home.
sheldon_cooper This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.
leonard_hofstadter When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
sheldon_cooper Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.
leonard_hofstadter What were you doing in his closet?
sheldon_cooper I helped run some cable for a webcam.
penny Hey guys.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.
penny Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
sheldon_cooper
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper No?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we'll get out of your hair.
penny Oh, great, thank you again.
sheldon_cooper Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.
penny What's he talking about?
leonard_hofstadter It's a joke.
penny I don't get it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he didn't tell it right.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Hello?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.
leonard_hofstadter Are you insane, you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
sheldon_cooper I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was ... this.
leonard_hofstadter Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?
sheldon_cooper I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
leonard_hofstadter No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
sheldon_cooper Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we have to get out of here.
sheldon_cooper You might want to speak in a lower register.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.
leonard_hofstadter That's ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper No, that's ridiculous.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.
sheldon_cooper I am not leaving until I'm done.
leonard_hofstadter O-o-o-oh!
sheldon_cooper If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, what the hell.
sheldon_cooper Morning.
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
sheldon_cooper I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.
leonard_hofstadter I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbor's apartment and clean.
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
leonard_hofstadter You think?
sheldon_cooper Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
sheldon_cooper You don't think that crosses a line?
leonard_hofstadter Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.
sheldon_cooper You have a sarcasm sign?
leonard_hofstadter No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
sheldon_cooper Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fiber end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.
penny Son of a Bitch!
leonard_hofstadter Penny's up.
penny You sick, geeky bastards!
leonard_hofstadter How did she know it was us?
sheldon_cooper I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.
penny Leonard!
leonard_hofstadter God, this is going to be bad.
sheldon_cooper Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.
penny You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but, only to clean.
sheldon_cooper Really more to organize, you're not actually dirty, per se.
penny Give me back my key.
leonard_hofstadter I'm very, very sorry.
penny Do you understand how creepy this is.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.
penny In my apartment, while I was sleeping.
sheldon_cooper And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.
penny And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
sheldon_cooper Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon. Oh!
penny God!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.
penny Stay away from me.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, that's another way to go.
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm. Well that was a little non-responsive.
leonard_hofstadter You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize. What's funny?
sheldon_cooper That wasn't sarcasm?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this.
penny What?
sheldon_cooper I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. I did what I could.
penny Hey Raj. Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?
raj_koothrappali Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?
penny You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?
raj_koothrappali She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.
penny It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.
penny I mean, just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?
raj_koothrappali She asked me a question. I should probably nod.
penny That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll.
raj_koothrappali Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis.
howard_wolowitz Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.
leonard_hofstadter It's fine. You win.
howard_wolowitz What's his problem?
sheldon_cooper His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
howard_wolowitz Been there.
raj_koothrappali Hello. Sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.
howard_wolowitz Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?
raj_koothrappali Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.
leonard_hofstadter What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
raj_koothrappali Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and ... then she hugged me.
howard_wolowitz She hugged you? How did she hug you? Is that her perfume I smell?
raj_koothrappali intoxicating, isn't it?
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
penny What's going on?
leonard_hofstadter Um, here's the thing. Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgment. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research ...
penny Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny We're okay.
leonard_hofstadter Six two inch dowels.
sheldon_cooper Check.
leonard_hofstadter One package, Phillips head screws.
sheldon_cooper Check.
penny Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media center.
leonard_hofstadter No, please, we insist, it's the least we can do considering.
sheldon_cooper Considering what? How great this place looks?
howard_wolowitz Oh boy, I was afraid of this.
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
penny Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.
leonard_hofstadter It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.
sheldon_cooper We could put her stereo back there.
leonard_hofstadter And control it how?
sheldon_cooper Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.
howard_wolowitz Good point, how you gonna cool it?
penny Hey guys, I got this.
sheldon_cooper Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?
leonard_hofstadter Also inefficient, and might be loud.
howard_wolowitz How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC ...
penny Guys, this is actually really simple.
howard_wolowitz Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?
sheldon_cooper And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
penny Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.
sheldon_cooper Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.
howard_wolowitz Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.
leonard_hofstadter Meet back here in an hour?
howard_wolowitz Done.
leonard_hofstadter Got it.
penny Okay, this place does look pretty good.
