sheldon_cooper Hold.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper Explain your sneeze.
raj_koothrappali I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper Do you have allergies?
raj_koothrappali No.
sheldon_cooper Is there too much pepper on your salad?
raj_koothrappali I don’t put pepper on salads.
sheldon_cooper I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself.
sheldon_cooper That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.
raj_koothrappali Guys, help me.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, come on.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. You’re on your own.
howard_wolowitz See you, buddy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
leonard_hofstadter When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
sheldon_cooper Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.
howard_wolowitz Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
howard_wolowitz Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.
sheldon_cooper For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
raj_koothrappali The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university.
leonard_hofstadter Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
sheldon_cooper I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
sheldon_cooper My room, of course.
raj_koothrappali Holy crap! Holy crap!
howard_wolowitz Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.
sheldon_cooper Go ahead.
howard_wolowitz A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
sheldon_cooper A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
howard_wolowitz So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
sheldon_cooper Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?
raj_koothrappali When can I sit with you again?
sheldon_cooper When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
howard_wolowitz Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where’s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
penny What? What are you doing with, what?
sheldon_cooper The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
penny Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
sheldon_cooper I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
penny Oh. What?
sheldon_cooper I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
penny Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
penny Oh, no, no, no, no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah, let’s go with puzzled.
sheldon_cooper A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.
penny Female jibber jabber?
sheldon_cooper Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.
penny Oh, they’re not my friends.
sheldon_cooper I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
leonard_hofstadter She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
sheldon_cooper Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I’d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn’t confuse it with what I’d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I’d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Nice to finally meet you in person.
sheldon_cooper I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard, I live
sheldon_cooper I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I’m sorry, I’m rambling. Hi-lo.
leonard_hofstadter Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
sheldon_cooper No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I’d pick the yogurt.
sheldon_cooper Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
leonard_hofstadter Look, it’s you.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.
leonard_hofstadter Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton I’m so glad you understand.
sheldon_cooper No, he doesn’t understand. I understand.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I understand, too.
sheldon_cooper You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
sheldon_cooper From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart.
sheldon_cooper Get it together, man.
sheldon_cooper All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Good to know.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton What if there’s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
sheldon_cooper Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Can I ask a question about your roommate?
sheldon_cooper He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton What’s his relationship status?
sheldon_cooper Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Okay.
sheldon_cooper Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton How thoughtful.
sheldon_cooper Sleep well, my friend.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton You, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck.
leonard_hofstadter Yes?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton I saw your light on.
leonard_hofstadter Is everything all right?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
leonard_hofstadter Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton I thought you already read it.
leonard_hofstadter I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Aw, you’re smart.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton What chapter are you on?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, six.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble’s constant.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. You really make science come alive.
sheldon_cooper Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
leonard_hofstadter Morning, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Morning.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Morning, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton More than pleasant.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself.
leonard_hofstadter How do you take your coffee?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Black.
leonard_hofstadter Okeydoke.
sheldon_cooper Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.
leonard_hofstadter Something his mother taught him.
sheldon_cooper All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton That’s very thoughtful, but I think I’ll finish my coffee first.
sheldon_cooper Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
penny Oh, good, you’re up. Look, my car won’t start. I need a ride to work.
sheldon_cooper Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
penny No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.
penny Hello.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Hi.
penny Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Nice to meet you.
penny Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Yes, very much.
penny Good.
sheldon_cooper Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Excuse me.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car.
penny Hang on.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
penny We just broke up.
leonard_hofstadter What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?
penny Not as good as you apparently.
leonard_hofstadter I, um, I don’t follow.
penny You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, now…
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
penny I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened.
sheldon_cooper That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Well…
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
sheldon_cooper The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
penny You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, I can still drive you.
penny Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
sheldon_cooper I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t betray Penny.
sheldon_cooper Not Penny, me!
leonard_hofstadter How am I betraying you?
sheldon_cooper Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I guess I did.
howard_wolowitz What the hell are you doing?
raj_koothrappali Relax, it’s Nyquil.
leonard_hofstadter You still have a cold?
raj_koothrappali Maybe, but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.
leonard_hofstadter Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night.
raj_koothrappali Did you get a cold, too?
leonard_hofstadter No, but I was awake all night.
howard_wolowitz If you want, I can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills.
raj_koothrappali She won’t notice they’re missing?
howard_wolowitz She doesn’t know she takes them.
leonard_hofstadter No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz ‘Cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.
raj_koothrappali Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
howard_wolowitz How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
raj_koothrappali It is if you love her and give her a name.
sheldon_cooper Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
raj_koothrappali Hi.
sheldon_cooper And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
howard_wolowitz Hi.
raj_koothrappali I’m a big fan of your work.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Thank you.
sheldon_cooper And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Hey, you.
leonard_hofstadter Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
leonard_hofstadter Sure. Black, right?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.
leonard_hofstadter Coming right up.
raj_koothrappali What?
howard_wolowitz What do you mean what? It’s Halo night.
raj_koothrappali I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
howard_wolowitz That’s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom’s chicken soup.
raj_koothrappali I’m not hungry.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Don’t send him away. Let him in.
howard_wolowitz Who’s that
raj_koothrappali I bought a parrot.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Hi. Howard, right?
howard_wolowitz Uh, yeah.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don’t have enough money to pay you. So we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.
howard_wolowitz Beg pardon?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton You two figure out the details, I’m going to go change into something I don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.
howard_wolowitz What the frak?
raj_koothrappali Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.
howard_wolowitz We broke up weeks ago.
raj_koothrappali Why didn’t you say anything?
howard_wolowitz I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, who’s ready for Halo?
raj_koothrappali Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
howard_wolowitz He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t understand.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Oh, good. Leonard’s here.
raj_koothrappali Good?
leonard_hofstadter Elizabeth? What’s going on?
dr_elizabeth_plimpton What’s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don’t have enough money to pay any of you.
leonard_hofstadter Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
howard_wolowitz Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
raj_koothrappali Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this?
leonard_hofstadter We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
howard_wolowitz I’m out.
dr_elizabeth_plimpton Everybody ready?
raj_koothrappali Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.
