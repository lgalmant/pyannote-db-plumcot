raj_koothrappali It was a nice retirement party.
howard_wolowitz I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.
leonard_hofstadter What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
howard_wolowitz I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.
sheldon_cooper These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.
leonard_hofstadter Can’t be very long.
raj_koothrappali Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Mm, indeed.
howard_wolowitz So sad.
sheldon_cooper Dibs.
barry_kripke What’s up, fewwas?
sheldon_cooper What are you doing here, Kripke?
barry_kripke Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
sheldon_cooper This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.
barry_kripke Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.
sheldon_cooper Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.
leonard_hofstadter You just called dibs.
sheldon_cooper Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
barry_kripke I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird.
professor_rothman Gentlemen.
all@ Professor Rothman.
professor_rothman Good evening.
all@ Good evening.
raj_koothrappali I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
amy_farrah_fowler I got you a little something.
penny A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
penny Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.
penny Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
penny Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you like it?
penny Do I like it? Wow.
amy_farrah_fowler So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?
penny Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…
amy_farrah_fowler No problem.
penny Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.
sheldon_cooper I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?
president_siebert Can’t this wait?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. We just need a word.
president_siebert Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my penis?
barry_kripke Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies.
president_siebert What do you want?
barry_kripke Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?
president_siebert Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?
sheldon_cooper We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
president_siebert Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.
barry_kripke Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.
sheldon_cooper Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.
president_siebert Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind.
barry_kripke Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak.
sheldon_cooper Kripke?
barry_kripke Yes?
sheldon_cooper You’re in my spot.
bernadette_rostenkowski That is big.
penny So big.
bernadette_rostenkowski And ugly.
penny So ugly. What am I gonna do?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.
penny Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
bernadette_rostenkowski That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
penny All right, it’s got to go.
bernadette_rostenkowski What will you tell Amy?
penny How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
bernadette_rostenkowski Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.
penny Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.
bernadette_rostenkowski Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting.
raj_koothrappali Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.
howard_wolowitz It’s numbered.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, limited edition. Nice.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’ll be Kripke.
leonard_hofstadter What’s he doing here?
sheldon_cooper We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea.
barry_kripke Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?
barry_kripke Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks.
sheldon_cooper Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
barry_kripke We’re not fwiends.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.
barry_kripke How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?
sheldon_cooper You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?
raj_koothrappali How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
barry_kripke What the fwig is that?
sheldon_cooper Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
all@ Hail.
barry_kripke How does it work?
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
barry_kripke I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?
sheldon_cooper Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
barry_kripke Almost got it. One more time.
sheldon_cooper Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you.
sheldon_cooper Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.
howard_wolowitz It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.
leonard_hofstadter H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
barry_kripke You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.
leonard_hofstadter It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
raj_koothrappali Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 Sports.
leonard_hofstadter All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Five what?
leonard_hofstadter Balls in the basket.
sheldon_cooper Ew!
barry_kripke It’s out, wight?
barry_kripke Time. Wan out of woom.
leonard_hofstadter You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
raj_koothrappali Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter I get it.
sheldon_cooper Hey! He did that on purpose,
leonard_hofstadter No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
barry_kripke Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter No. No, I’m not.
sheldon_cooper Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. I’m gonna need more force.
barry_kripke Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. Do I get points for that?
leonard_hofstadter All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else.
sheldon_cooper What do you propose?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
barry_kripke Oh, you are going down, Cooper.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.
leonard_hofstadter All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon was higher.
leonard_hofstadter Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.
sheldon_cooper Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, what a great movie.
penny I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
amy_farrah_fowler My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.
amy_farrah_fowler I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.
penny Good night, real Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good night, real Penny.
penny Bye.
bernadette_rostenkowski Good night, transvestite Penny.
penny Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.
penny Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?
penny It’s right over there.
amy_farrah_fowler Why?
penny I have no idea. That is weird.
amy_farrah_fowler You hate it.
penny No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.
amy_farrah_fowler I feel like an idiot.
penny No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.
amy_farrah_fowler Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.
penny Oh, Amy, come on.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.
sheldon_cooper Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.
raj_koothrappali I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. Call first.
professor_rothman Oh. Hello.
sheldon_cooper Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.
professor_rothman I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.
penny I came to say I’m sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t bother.
penny Oh, Amy, please.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.
penny I know.
amy_farrah_fowler I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
penny You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.
penny I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
amy_farrah_fowler I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.
penny Amy, come on…
amy_farrah_fowler If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.
penny Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now.
penny Grab your hammer.
amy_farrah_fowler No. Damage is done.
penny Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.
penny Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…
amy_farrah_fowler You have such a good heart.
penny Huh, I try.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on.
penny Well where are we going?
amy_farrah_fowler We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
penny Well, what about Bernadette?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
sheldon_cooper Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.
leonard_hofstadter Why is there a hole here?
raj_koothrappali Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.
sheldon_cooper Is it? Listen.
raj_koothrappali What, you don’t like wind chimes?
sheldon_cooper No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.
howard_wolowitz The bird?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.
raj_koothrappali So?
sheldon_cooper You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?
howard_wolowitz The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
sheldon_cooper No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, relax.
sheldon_cooper How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
leonard_hofstadter If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?
sheldon_cooper What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
penny How’s that?
amy_farrah_fowler Little higher on the right.
penny Now?
amy_farrah_fowler Little more. No. That’s got it.
penny Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll let you in on a little secret.
penny Mm.
amy_farrah_fowler Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.
penny Yeah, good call.
amy_farrah_fowler But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.
penny You’re talking about the painting, right?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
sheldon_cooper Help! Somebody help!
leonard_hofstadter What happened?
sheldon_cooper I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
leonard_hofstadter Why would you do that?
sheldon_cooper It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
leonard_hofstadter Hang in there. I’ll be right back.
