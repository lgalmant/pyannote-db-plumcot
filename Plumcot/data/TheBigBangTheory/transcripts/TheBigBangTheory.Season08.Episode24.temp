amy Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?
sheldon I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
amy That’s what you’re thinking about?
sheldon Well, one of the things.
amy Are any of them me?
sheldon Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.
amy What are you doing?
sheldon You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.
amy I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.
sheldon Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
amy Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?
sheldon Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.
amy Oh, sure, I’d love to.
sheldon Whenever you’re ready.
stuart I don’t want to rush you, but I’m closing a little early tonight.
raj Ooh. Hot date?
stuart Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don’t have to not ask me twice.
emily If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?
raj You’re kidding, right?
emily Oh. Is this freaking you out?
raj I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.
emily All right. Never mind.
raj No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you.
stuart Sold.
emily Raj, you don’t have to do that.
stuart Too late. No returns.
leonard That was really intense.
penny Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.
leonard Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
sheldon What happened?
penny Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
sheldon Been there.
penny Mmm. So what do you need help with?
sheldon Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.
penny Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
sheldon Yes.
penny That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?
sheldon Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.
penny And that made her angry?
sheldon Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.
penny Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.
sheldon It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
penny Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?
leonard I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
sheldon Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.
leonard I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
sheldon Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.
penny Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.
sheldon Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.
penny Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.
sheldon If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.
raj You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
bernadette You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?
raj No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.
howard One more time?
raj She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.
howard Like, a random person or somebody she knew?
raj What difference does it make?
howard Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.
bernadette The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it.
raj Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?
bernadette Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.
raj I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.
howard Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?
bernadette I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.
howard How are you saying that with a straight face?
bernadette I don’t know.
raj You guys are being jerks.
howard Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life.
raj You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.
howard That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.
raj Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.
bernadette That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.
penny Thanks for cooking.
leonard Mmm. My pleasure.
penny That carrot was delicious.
leonard Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
penny Still haven’t heard from her?
sheldon No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.
penny Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
sheldon Too slow?
penny Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together.
sheldon That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
penny Uh, hello.
sheldon Hello.
penny No. Sheldon, we’re getting married.
sheldon But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date.
penny Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush.
sheldon Okay.
leonard We’re gonna set a date.
sheldon Okay. If you say so.
penny Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now.
leonard Really good.
penny I’m focusing on my job.
leonard And we’ve been busy with our paper.
penny So busy.
leonard Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date.
penny Yeah.
sheldon Okay.
penny You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you.
sheldon Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.
bernadette Did you eat all my yoghurt?
howard You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?
bernadette You know which yoghurt I mean.
howard I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.
bernadette Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
howard We should have done it months ago.
bernadette I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.
howard Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that.
bernadette All right. Tonight’s the night.
howard Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer.
bernadette Ooh, I like when you take charge.
howard Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer.
leonard So, why haven’t we picked a date?
penny You know why.
leonard Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?
penny Not in a rush, busy with work…
sheldon Things are good right now.
penny Really good.
leonard You still want to get married, right?
penny Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?
leonard I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?
penny Well, you want a date, pick a date.
leonard It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?
sheldon Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
penny Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?
leonard Is your dad paying for it?
penny I doubt it.
leonard Okay, two friends each.
penny All right, well, I want it in a church.
leonard Fine. I want black-tie.
penny Fine. I want to release butterflies.
sheldon Seriously? Airborne worms?
leonard Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.
penny Sounds perfect.
leonard Great.
sheldon You still didn’t pick a date.
penny Stay out of it.
leonard Shut up.
emily Mmm. It’s a beautiful night.
raj Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.
emily Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?
raj So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.
emily You aren’t scared, are you?
raj Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.
sheldon I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
penny No, it’s okay.
leonard Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.
sheldon Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?
penny Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.
sheldon Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?
penny Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
sheldon So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?
leonard Sheldon, I’m not a whiner.
sheldon It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
leonard Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.
penny Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross.
leonard Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together.
sheldon My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.
penny Um, I’m free tonight.
leonard Are you saying you want to get married?
penny Vegas isn’t that far away.
leonard I’m in. Let’s do it.
sheldon After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.
penny Oh, thank you.
leonard Thanks.
sheldon Now get out of my spot.
howard Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.
bernadette Right.
howard Good luck.
bernadette Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.
howard Never should have told you my middle name.
stuart Hey, guys.
howard Hey, you got a minute?
stuart Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.
bernadette Don’t let that sway you.
howard It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.
stuart What’s up?
bernadette So, we need to talk.
emily You okay?
raj I think we should talk.
stuart Is everything okay?
bernadette Well, you’ve been living here a while now.
stuart I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.
bernadette Yeah.
howard His middle name is David. Go.
raj Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.
emily Are you breaking up with me?
raj No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.
bernadette So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is…
howard You need to take that?
stuart It’s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I’ll call him back. You were saying?
emily Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don’t expect me to do it for you.
raj End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.
howard_and_bernadette Happy birthday to you.
penny Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.
leonard Doesn’t sound very romantic.
penny Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.
leonard I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
penny Yeah. This is crazy.
leonard I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
penny Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.
leonard It is. It is about us.
penny And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.
leonard Right. No surprises.
penny And no regrets.
leonard Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.
penny What?
leonard You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.
penny What?
leonard Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?
penny Yeah.
leonard Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.
penny No, you told me.
leonard Okay, um, well, there was this girl.
penny What did you do?
leonard Nothing really. It was just kissing.
penny And then what?
leonard And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.
penny All right.
leonard Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
penny Nope, never.
leonard Oh, that’s too bad.
penny You know, can I ask you a question?
leonard Hmm?
penny Why are you telling me this now?
leonard Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.
penny Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.
leonard Would you rather I didn’t tell you?
penny No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.
leonard See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?
penny Uh, keep your mouth off other women.
leonard I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.
penny Okay.
leonard Yeah?
penny Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.
leonard Right.
penny Just kissing.
leonard It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.
penny Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking.
leonard So, we’re still getting married?
penny Yes.
leonard Because we love each other.
penny Yes.
leonard And it’s the happiest day of our lives.
penny Ha-ha, don’t push it.
amy Hello.
sheldon Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…
amy I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years.
sheldon Strongly disagree. Go on.
amy Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.
sheldon Oh.
amy I hope you understand.
sheldon Okay.
amy Bye, Sheldon.
sheldon Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
