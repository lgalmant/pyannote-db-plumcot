howard T-minus 60 seconds.
raj Oh, it all comes down to this.
leonard Oh, I’ve got butterflies.
sheldon Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.
penny What’s going on?
leonard Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.
penny Oh.
howard T Minus 45 seconds.
leonard They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes…
sheldon Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.
penny This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
howard T-minus 30 seconds.
raj Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.
sheldon Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.
raj And I told you I get diaper rash.
howard 15 seconds.
leonard Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.
howard Five, four, three, two, one.
sheldon It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.
raj Anyone in?
sheldon No.
leonard Not yet.
howard Nope.
sheldon Do not stop refreshing your screens.
all Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….
penny Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.
all Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…
howard It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.
penny To be cool? Yeah.
leonard I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue.
sheldon Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
raj Uh, what number in line are you?
leonard Uh, fifteen…
howard Great.
leonard …thousand two hundred and eleven.
howard Damn.
raj Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.
howard Really?
leonard Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.
sheldon Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.
leonard Sunday’s gone.
sheldon Not Sunday, I love Sunday.
raj So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?
leonard Yeah.
howard I can’t believe we’re not going.
sheldon It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me.
penny Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.
sheldon I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
penny What? You were all going as the Hulk?
howard Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.
raj We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
all Yeah.
penny And we’re back to the first kind of sad.
sheldon Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.
leonard Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.
sheldon I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
leonard Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.
howard I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.
sheldon How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
leonard The same way I know that the people in the TV set can’t see me.
howard Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your own convention.
sheldon You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.
sheldon Yes, I’m starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.
leonard Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
sheldon I didn’t even get to that part.
leonard Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.
sheldon Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he shampoos his beard.
leonard Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to come together for you.
sheldon You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
leonard Good luck.
sheldon No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he can be pretty nuts.
penny I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets.
amy Last week, you spent that on a little dress.
penny Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.
bernadette Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his toys away.
amy Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?
bernadette Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.
amy Oh. You mean like a museum?
penny Yes, like a museum, but anything else.
bernadette Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.
amy Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.
penny Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.
bernadette La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.
penny No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.
raj Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.
leonard Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.
howard Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don’t exist were over.
sheldon Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.
leonard Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
sheldon I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.
raj How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
sheldon Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and that’s where I’m going, and…
howard And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
leonard Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.
sheldon You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble. You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…
howard Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he’s running late.
raj Does he sound like a criminal?
howard What do you mean?
raj You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?
leonard Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from 1940.
raj I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?
howard Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
raj I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?
leonard Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.
howard Why do you think I told him to come to your place?
amy There sure are a lot of little kids here.
penny I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
bernadette I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
amy Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.
bernadette That’s cute.
amy It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
bernadette Should we leave?
penny Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.
bernadette I could go for a drink.
amy Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.
james_earl_jones Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?
sheldon Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker.
james_earl_jones Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.
sheldon He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.
raj Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.
leonard Maybe this isn’t a good idea.
howard I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
raj Do it.
howard Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.
leonard Hold on. We always do this.
howard Do what?
leonard Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.
raj That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.
leonard Even Batman breaks the rules.
raj You know I struggle with Batman.
leonard I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be badasses.
raj Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.
leonard Howard, you in on this?
howard No need. I’m breaking rules all the time.
leonard Name one.
howard Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
raj What about that little cup they give you?
howard Yeah. What about it?
raj Are you impressed by that?
leonard A little.
raj Yeah, me, too.
james You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.
sheldon Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?
james He was not. How messed up was that?
sheldon So messed up.
james What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.
penny So, afternoon tea was a bust.
amy On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.
penny Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.
bernadette Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.
penny Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.
amy Gosh.
penny I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.
amy I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.
penny Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.
bernadette Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.
penny Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
howard He just parked. He’s on his way up.
leonard Good. This is exciting.
raj It is. I feel alive.
leonard Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.
raj Maybe slapped with a fine.
howard Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?
raj Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?
leonard I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
raj He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?
howard Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away.
raj I thought you were a badass.
howard I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.
sheldon Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?
james It is true.
sheldon Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
james They sure did.
sheldon Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
james That’s right.
sheldon Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.
penny I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?
bernadette Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.
penny I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.
amy I told you it was Penny.
penny Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.
amy Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure they’re having more fun than we are.
howard Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.
sheldon Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.
james I am.
sheldon In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight…
james Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…
sheldon Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.
james Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…
sceme Outside a house.
sheldon I don’t understand what we’re doing.
james Shh.
sheldon Whose house is this?
james Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to run.
carrie_fisher It’s not funny anymore, James.
james Then why am I laughing?
james Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.
sheldon Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
james What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?
sheldon Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
james No. Something about a convention.
sheldon Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.
james Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?
sheldon Really?
james Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every night.
sheldon Ay-yi-yi.
james Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.
james So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.
sheldon I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?
