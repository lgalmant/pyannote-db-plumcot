penny So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?
bernadette Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.
amy Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.
bernadette Really?
amy Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.
bernadette That’s horrible.
amy Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.
bernadette I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?
penny Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.
amy Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.
sheldon Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny.
leonard Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?
howard What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?
sheldon I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
penny Okay, that time you looked at me.
amy Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
sheldon Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.
penny All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?
bernadette Oh, me.
penny Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving.
amy Wait for moi.
sheldon You’re leaving?
amy Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.
sheldon Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?
raj Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable.
leonard Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?
amy Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
sheldon She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
amy It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.
howard That’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
amy The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week.
howard Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?
sheldon Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
leonard This time, it’s your fault.
sheldon I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.
leonard Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?
amy I don’t know, four or five years.
leonard No, it’s not gonna do it.
howard Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.
amy They’re out shopping right now?
howard Yeah.
amy Just the two of them?
howard I guess.
amy That’s cool, that’s cool.
howard Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?
leonard Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up.
sheldon What?
leonard Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air.
sheldon Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.
leonard Did you try calling her on the telephone?
sheldon The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.
leonard If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right.
sheldon Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.
leonard I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
sheldon Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
leonard You do?
sheldon Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat.
leonard Forget about the bobcat.
sheldon How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.
amy Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.
sheldon She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s go.
leonard Uh, she’s your friend. Step up.
leonard Amy. Amy. Amy. Bye.
sheldon Where are you going?
leonard I’m single, I don’t need this crap.
amy Sheldon, what are you doing here?
sheldon You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
amy I wanted to be alone.
sheldon Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
amy Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.
sheldon Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?
amy It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.
sheldon If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.
amy Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
sheldon And that made you feel sad?
amy Yes.
sheldon I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this.
amy It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.
sheldon When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw.
amy Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you to keep an open mind.
sheldon Always.
amy At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.
sheldon Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.
amy Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
sheldon Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy.
amy How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.
sheldon Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.
amy We cuddle. Final offer.
sheldon Very well. Oh, boy.
amy I’m just saying, second base is right there.
raj Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.
leonard For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
raj This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.
sheldon The two of you need to get your women in line!
howard What?
sheldon Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.
howard What do you want us to do about it?
sheldon You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!
leonard Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.
sheldon You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!
leonard Moo-shu is Penny.
penny Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?
leonard Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.
bernadette That’s so sweet.
leonard Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.
howard So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset.
penny Why?
leonard Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
bernadette I told you that would happen.
penny Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.
bernadette She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other.
penny Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers
bernadette We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.
penny I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?
howard Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking.
bernadette Oh, Howie.
howard Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.
penny What do you tell him?
bernadette Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.
leonard Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?
penny No. All your little secrets are fine.
bernadette Yes, absolutely fine.
howard I’ll tell you later.
amy Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.
penny Hi.
bernadette Hello.
amy What are you doing here?
penny Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.
amy That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.
penny Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want.
bernadette We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
penny With-with loofah mitts, no hands.
amy It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
bernadette Amy, we’re really sorry.
penny Yeah, we feel awful.
amy Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.
penny Oh, come on, Amy.
amy You don’t get it. Look at this brain.
penny I don’t really want to.
amy This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.
bernadette Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. .
sheldon Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way.
leonard What’s going on?
sheldon It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
leonard Really? Amy?
sheldon Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful.
amy Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.
leonard Hi, Amy.
amy Hey, Cuddles.
leonard Cuddles?
sheldon Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.
leonard Amy, what are you doing here?
amy Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you’re sad.
leonard Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?
amy Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.
leonard Maybe we should get you home.
amy Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?
leonard Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?
sheldon I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go.
leonard Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
amy Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.
amy I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.
penny Hi.
amy What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
penny I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
amy When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.
penny No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.
bernadette We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right.
penny We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.
bernadette Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
amy What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?
bernadette No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.
amy Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died.
bernadette So is that a yes?
amy Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So that’s happening.
penny Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.
amy I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?
penny Sorry.
amy Really?
penny Okay, yeah.
amy Yay!
amy Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.
bernadette We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?
amy I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?
bernadette I am the bride.
amy So no. And action.
penny What do you think?
bernadette I love it!
amy What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin.
bernadette Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!
amy You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.
penny Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!
amy You do.
bernadette Thank you.
amy Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.
amy Come on, bestie, you’re up.
penny Give me a minute.
amy What is taking you so long?
penny Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!
amy – Sorry, sorry.
penny Oh, God. Amy!
amy Sorry.
