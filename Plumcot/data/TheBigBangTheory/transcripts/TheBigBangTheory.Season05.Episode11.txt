penny Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
penny Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
sheldon_cooper I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
leonard_hofstadter You want to hear something weird?
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.
sheldon_cooper Oh. I thought it was a game.
penny What’s yours?
leonard_hofstadter There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.
sheldon_cooper Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.
leonard_hofstadter Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.
penny Basketball Pope.
sheldon_cooper And that’s how it’s done.
penny What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
leonard_hofstadter No, that was a different guy.
sheldon_cooper Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?
leonard_hofstadter No, that was a different, different guy.
sheldon_cooper Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
leonard_hofstadter No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister.
penny All right, well, what do you think he wants?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
leonard_hofstadter I told you. That was a different guy.
penny Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
leonard_hofstadter It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
sheldon_cooper Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
leonard_hofstadter Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
sheldon_cooper Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
sheldon_cooper So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t have clams.
sheldon_cooper I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
leonard_hofstadter It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
sheldon_cooper Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?
leonard_hofstadter You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”
sheldon_cooper Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?
penny ‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.
penny Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
amy_farrah_fowler When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?
penny Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.
penny Oh, that’s awful.
bernadette_rostenkowski Worst part was, it was too big.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.
penny Wow. You poor thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about you?
penny Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?
penny No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, that’s awful.
penny No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.
amy_farrah_fowler Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
penny Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
amy_farrah_fowler Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
penny What? I was not a bully.
bernadette_rostenkowski Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
amy_farrah_fowler Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
raj_koothrappali Is that him over there?
leonard_hofstadter No.
raj_koothrappali How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
leonard_hofstadter You know, I can really do this by myself.
howard_wolowitz Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy.
leonard_hofstadter No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.
howard_wolowitz You wore underwear? You fool.
raj_koothrappali So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?
leonard_hofstadter You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
howard_wolowitz That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?
leonard_hofstadter Scrotum.
raj_koothrappali What’s that one?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, stapled.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now.
sheldon_cooper And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
leonard_hofstadter I’m doing okay, I guess.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.
leonard_hofstadter The Newcomb medal.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah, congratulations.
sheldon_cooper Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?
raj_koothrappali Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.
sheldon_cooper My point.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.
howard_wolowitz Like the Black Death and Europe.
leonard_hofstadter Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.
sheldon_cooper Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the idea?
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 This is just between us, right?
leonard_hofstadter Right.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?
raj_koothrappali That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie.
howard_wolowitz How exactly would these glasses work?
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known.
sheldon_cooper The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I got this.
sheldon_cooper You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 I don’t understand.
leonard_hofstadter I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
sheldon_cooper A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
raj_koothrappali That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 What is that?
sheldon_cooper This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
leonard_hofstadter 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 What’s this word?
leonard_hofstadter Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
sheldon_cooper You really need to work on your penmanship.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t fun for me.
sheldon_cooper You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, guys.
raj_koothrappali That was pretty badass, dude.
sheldon_cooper I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.
penny Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re doing great.
penny Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.
amy_farrah_fowler I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt.
bernadette_rostenkowski Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now.
penny That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
amy_farrah_fowler Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
penny Both.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
penny I actually knew that.
amy_farrah_fowler I never doubted you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
penny Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?
amy_farrah_fowler There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.
penny Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?
amy_farrah_fowler How about donating some of your clothes?
penny Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about helping people?
penny And helping people.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s your cocoa.
sheldon_cooper Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?
leonard_hofstadter You got one for good luck. I’ll get it.
sheldon_cooper One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Hey.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?
leonard_hofstadter Laxative.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 You’re a beautiful guy.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay, I got to go.
leonard_hofstadter Are you okay to drive?
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 I wouldn’t be imposing?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we can’t let him drive.
sheldon_cooper Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
leonard_hofstadter You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner.
sheldon_cooper You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 You mind if I use your bathroom?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, just back there.
howard_wolowitz How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
sheldon_cooper You know what would be nice?
raj_koothrappali What’s that?
sheldon_cooper As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it.
penny Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
penny Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.
bernadette_rostenkowski Donated.
penny Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.
bernadette_rostenkowski Penny.
penny Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable.
sheldon_cooper Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.
leonard_hofstadter What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
sheldon_cooper You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 When did I have tacos?
leonard_hofstadter Morning, Jimmy.
sheldon_cooper Oh, there it is, tacos.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Man, I tied one on.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 What apology?
leonard_hofstadter For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Geez, you’re still harping on that? What a puss.
leonard_hofstadter That’s my French toast.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 It’s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.
sheldon_cooper I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.
leonard_hofstadter I might kill him right now.
sheldon_cooper The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.
leonard_hofstadter No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
sheldon_cooper Well said, Boy Wonder.
jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Or what?
sheldon_cooper Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! Uh-oh.
sheldon_cooper You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
sheldon_cooper I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t feel good about this.
penny Then sit in the car and keep it running.
amy_farrah_fowler You were right, a whole new load.
penny Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.
amy_farrah_fowler Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.
bernadette_rostenkowski God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?
penny Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.
amy_farrah_fowler What is it, the fuzz?
penny Look at us. What are we doing?
amy_farrah_fowler I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don’t know about Bernadette.
penny You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!
