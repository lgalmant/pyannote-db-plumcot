howard_wolowitz So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.
raj_koothrappali I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.
howard_wolowitz Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.
leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding.
raj_koothrappali Why?
howard_wolowitz He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.
leonard_hofstadter That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.
howard_wolowitz You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
raj_koothrappali Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he worships Hawking.
howard_wolowitz I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
raj_koothrappali That’s really nice of you, Howard.
howard_wolowitz Hm, it’s no big deal.
leonard_hofstadter Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?
leonard_hofstadter Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
sheldon_cooper Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
raj_koothrappali That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.
sheldon_cooper Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it.
raj_koothrappali Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
howard_wolowitz Yep.
leonard_hofstadter Still going to introduce him?
howard_wolowitz Not on your life.
sheldon_cooper Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.
howard_wolowitz I told you, no.
sheldon_cooper But I said I’m sorry.
howard_wolowitz No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?
sheldon_cooper And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?
sheldon_cooper Um, to go to Jewish heaven?
howard_wolowitz Jews don’t have heaven.
sheldon_cooper Then to avoid Jewish hell?
howard_wolowitz Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
sheldon_cooper Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.
howard_wolowitz Oh, you can’t be serious.
sheldon_cooper Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.
howard_wolowitz Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.
howard_wolowitz Get out of my lab.
sheldon_cooper Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?
howard_wolowitz Get out.
sheldon_cooper How about dolphins?
howard_wolowitz Out!
leonard_hofstadter So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?
howard_wolowitz It was great. We talked about movies.
sheldon_cooper Oh!
howard_wolowitz I showed him some card tricks.
sheldon_cooper Oh!
howard_wolowitz He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
sheldon_cooper Oh!
howard_wolowitz Something got you down there, bunky?
sheldon_cooper Howard, please, I’m begging you.
leonard_hofstadter Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
raj_koothrappali Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.
sheldon_cooper Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.
howard_wolowitz You’re kidding.
sheldon_cooper No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.
howard_wolowitz You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.
sheldon_cooper It’s actually 01100111.
howard_wolowitz No!
sheldon_cooper I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking.
howard_wolowitz Let me try gansta, hells no.
sheldon_cooper Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me.
leonard_hofstadter What if he doesn’t?
sheldon_cooper He will, he’s really smart.
howard_wolowitz That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
sheldon_cooper How do I do that?
howard_wolowitz You walk away.
sheldon_cooper Walking away.
leonard_hofstadter You do realize you own his ass right now.
howard_wolowitz I do.
raj_koothrappali You can make him do anything you want.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.
raj_koothrappali Well, don’t be too mean.
sheldon_cooper Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.
raj_koothrappali I wouldn’t mind a glass.
sheldon_cooper I wasn’t talking to you.
raj_koothrappali Bring him to his bony knees.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, come on back.
sheldon_cooper Yes, yes. What did you decide?
howard_wolowitz I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
sheldon_cooper Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific.
howard_wolowitz But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me.
sheldon_cooper What kinds of things?
howard_wolowitz Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
sheldon_cooper Of course.
howard_wolowitz You should be so lucky.
sheldon_cooper All right. What would you like me to do first?
howard_wolowitz Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.
sheldon_cooper Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
howard_wolowitz That’s nice.
sheldon_cooper That’s a lot of belt buckles.
howard_wolowitz Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back.
sheldon_cooper You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.
howard_wolowitz Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.
howard_wolowitz Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
sheldon_cooper My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
howard_wolowitz Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.
sheldon_cooper And you want me to return it for you?
howard_wolowitz No, no, no, mon petit cherie.
sheldon_cooper What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
penny Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
penny It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
sheldon_cooper This is not my laundry.
penny Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her.
sheldon_cooper Those are Howard’s.
penny Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
sheldon_cooper Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist.
penny Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.
sheldon_cooper That’s close enough.
penny I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?
sheldon_cooper Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?
penny Well…
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…
penny I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
sheldon_cooper Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.
penny Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
sheldon_cooper Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
penny See, there it is, there’s that twinkle.
sheldon_cooper Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.
penny What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
penny Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
sheldon_cooper I knew it.
howard_wolowitz What’s the matter?
bernadette_rostenkowski Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.
howard_wolowitz It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, that’s terrible.
howard_wolowitz Hey, I gave you first crack at it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.
howard_wolowitz He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
bernadette_rostenkowski If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great.
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, you have to stop now.
debbie_wolowitz Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him.
debbie_wolowitz Sheldon! I need your help!
sheldon_cooper What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?
debbie_wolowitz It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!
sheldon_cooper What do you want me to do?
debbie_wolowitz We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.
sheldon_cooper I’m not sure how to do this.
debbie_wolowitz It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag.
sheldon_cooper Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay.
debbie_wolowitz Now zip me up.
sheldon_cooper Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.
debbie_wolowitz You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!
howard_wolowitz Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.
leonard_hofstadter What are these?
howard_wolowitz Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?
raj_koothrappali Wow, that’s amazing.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.
sheldon_cooper I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.
howard_wolowitz I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
sheldon_cooper Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
sheldon_cooper Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.
howard_wolowitz All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
howard_wolowitz Give me a compliment.
sheldon_cooper Fine. You have very tiny hands.
howard_wolowitz No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do.
sheldon_cooper You’re obviously good at what you do.
howard_wolowitz Well, then why are you always ripping on me?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing.
leonard_hofstadter It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.
howard_wolowitz Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
howard_wolowitz Sorry, I can’t.
sheldon_cooper What, why not?
howard_wolowitz I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
sheldon_cooper All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.
raj_koothrappali I thought he might be a little more excited.
leonard_hofstadter Give it a second.
sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.
stephen_hawking I know.
sheldon_cooper I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
stephen_hawking My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.
sheldon_cooper I know.
stephen_hawking Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.
stephen_hawking That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong.
sheldon_cooper What do you mean wrong?
stephen_hawking You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.
sheldon_cooper No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.
stephen_hawking Are you saying I do?
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.
stephen_hawking Great, another fainter.
