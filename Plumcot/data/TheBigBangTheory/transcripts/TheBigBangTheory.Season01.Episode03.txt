howard_wolowitz Alright, just a few more feet, and... here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.
sheldon_cooper Good lord!
raj_koothrappali Oooh.
leonard_hofstadter Don't panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.
howard_wolowitz Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.
leonard_hofstadter Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
sheldon_cooper Lock and load.
howard_wolowitz Raj, blow up the gates.
raj_koothrappali Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!
howard_wolowitz Don't just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.
leonard_hofstadter Stay in formation.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, you've got one on your tail.
leonard_hofstadter That's alright, my tail's prehensile, I'll swat him off.
raj_koothrappali I've got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
leonard_hofstadter Raj, no, it's a trap, they're flanking us!
raj_koothrappali Oooh, he's got me.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, he's got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper I've got the Sword of Azeroth!
leonard_hofstadter Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
sheldon_cooper There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!
howard_wolowitz Leonard look out!
leonard_hofstadter Dammit man, we're dying here.
sheldon_cooper Goodbye, peasants.
leonard_hofstadter The bastard teleported.
raj_koothrappali He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
leonard_hofstadter You betrayed us for money, who are you?
sheldon_cooper I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked 'buy it now.'
howard_wolowitz I am the Swordmaster!
sheldon_cooper Wooh, I'm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.
leonard_hofstadter No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
howard_wolowitz Sounds like your neighbor's home.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me.
sheldon_cooper Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, right right right right.
howard_wolowitz Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, the mailman did it again, he... Oh! Sorry.
penny Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard.
doug What's up bro.
leonard_hofstadter Not much. Bro.
penny Is, is everything okay.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.
penny Thank you, I've got to talk to that mailman.
leonard_hofstadter Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.
penny Okay, well, thank you, again.
leonard_hofstadter No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro!
sheldon_cooper Penny for your thoughts.
raj_koothrappali What's the matter.
leonard_hofstadter No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and...
howard_wolowitz Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?
leonard_hofstadter What is wrong with you?
howard_wolowitz I'm a romantic.
sheldon_cooper Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
leonard_hofstadter No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.
howard_wolowitz Because he looked better than you?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
sheldon_cooper Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyze the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.
howard_wolowitz I disagree, love is not a sprint, it's a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.
raj_koothrappali Like who?
leonard_hofstadter I don't know. Olivia Geiger?
sheldon_cooper The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Well, I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.
howard_wolowitz I don't know, you guys work in the same lab.
leonard_hofstadter So?
howard_wolowitz There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm... a bit of a self-taught expert.
leonard_hofstadter Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.
howard_wolowitz Oh, then you're probably okay.
leonard_hofstadter Hello Lesley.
leslie_winkle Hi Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
leslie_winkle Goggles, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.
leslie_winkle Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o' noodles.
leonard_hofstadter Pfff, I've done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.
leslie_winkle Wait, are you asking me out?
leonard_hofstadter I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don't need to quibble over terminology.
leslie_winkle What sort of experiment would you propose?
leonard_hofstadter There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.
leslie_winkle Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
leonard_hofstadter Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.
leslie_winkle Well, why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.
leonard_hofstadter You mean, kiss you now?
leslie_winkle Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
leslie_winkle Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?
leslie_winkle No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.
leslie_winkle What do you think.
leonard_hofstadter You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.
leslie_winkle Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal.
leonard_hofstadter None?
leslie_winkle None.
leonard_hofstadter Ah. Well, thank you for your time.
leslie_winkle Thank you.
leonard_hofstadter None at all?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?
sheldon_cooper That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?
howard_wolowitz Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side.
sheldon_cooper Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics?
raj_koothrappali You might be bound by them right now.
howard_wolowitz That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
sheldon_cooper Of course not.
howard_wolowitz Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?
sheldon_cooper Well, no.
howard_wolowitz I smell robot.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, what's going on.
sheldon_cooper The internet's been down for half an hour.
raj_koothrappali Also, Sheldon may be a robot.
howard_wolowitz So, how did it go with Lesley?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it.
raj_koothrappali You could power down.
howard_wolowitz Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.
instructor Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven.
howard_wolowitz I think Mrs Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there, you're in for a treat.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good lord.
leonard_hofstadter You don't know me, you don't wear my chains... God, that's a good song.
sheldon_cooper If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.
leonard_hofstadter I know what you're thinking, I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, listen to me...
leonard_hofstadter I've been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?
leonard_hofstadter Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.
leonard_hofstadter It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me.
sheldon_cooper Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.
leonard_hofstadter You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.
sheldon_cooper No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat.
leonard_hofstadter No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out.
sheldon_cooper Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.
penny Ah, hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.
penny Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?
leonard_hofstadter There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.
penny Supper?
leonard_hofstadter Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.
penny Uh, six thirty's great.
leonard_hofstadter Really? Great!
penny Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.
leonard_hofstadter Us guys?
penny You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?
leonard_hofstadter They... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.
penny Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Did we say a time?
penny Six thirty.
leonard_hofstadter And that's still good for you.
penny It's fine.
leonard_hofstadter Cos it's not carved in stone.
penny No, six thirty's great.
leonard_hofstadter I'll get my chisel.
penny Why?
leonard_hofstadter To... carve the... okay, I'll see you six thirty.
leonard_hofstadter How do I look?
sheldon_cooper Could you be more specific?
leonard_hofstadter Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
sheldon_cooper No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
leonard_hofstadter Six thirty.
sheldon_cooper Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.
leonard_hofstadter Is it too much?
sheldon_cooper Not if you're a rugby team.
leonard_hofstadter By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos.
sheldon_cooper Why would I join you?
leonard_hofstadter No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.
leonard_hofstadter You're right, alcohol, poor judgment, it could go well.
sheldon_cooper Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.
leonard_hofstadter You could have stopped at 'it could go well.'
sheldon_cooper If I could of, I would of.
leonard_hofstadter I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, 'you love pottery? I love pottery!' You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realize, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!
sheldon_cooper Is the sex starting now?
leonard_hofstadter I'm having a panic attack.
sheldon_cooper Oh, okay, well then, calm down.
leonard_hofstadter If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.
sheldon_cooper Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper Just do it.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.
sheldon_cooper Me?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper What should I tell her.
leonard_hofstadter I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.
sheldon_cooper Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal. I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.
leonard_hofstadter Give me the phone.
sheldon_cooper But I thought you wanted to cancel?
leonard_hofstadter I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.
sheldon_cooper Why would she be expecting me?
leonard_hofstadter Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.
penny So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.
penny Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
leonard_hofstadter You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.
penny How?
leonard_hofstadter We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
penny So, what's new in the world of physics?
leonard_hofstadter Nothing.
penny Really, nothing?
leonard_hofstadter Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930's, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say 'hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.'
penny Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.
leonard_hofstadter What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?
penny Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.
leonard_hofstadter Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.
penny Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he's nice and funny, but...
waitress Can I get you started with some drinks?
leonard_hofstadter No, You were saying, but...
penny I'd like a drink.
leonard_hofstadter Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.
penny Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.
leonard_hofstadter Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.
penny It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of... well, you know.
leonard_hofstadter I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one... glorious summer.
penny No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, chafing, right?
penny Emotionally.
leonard_hofstadter Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.
penny How?
leonard_hofstadter Physics.
penny Wow, centrifugal force!
leonard_hofstadter Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. Excuse me. Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would
penny Are you okay?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?
penny No.
leonard_hofstadter I'm not okay.
penny Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.
penny I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, but I get car sick too, so...
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry about your car, by the way.
penny Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window.
leonard_hofstadter The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
penny Yeah, me too. Um, good night. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Was this supposed to be a date?
leonard_hofstadter This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.
penny Okay, I was just checking.
leonard_hofstadter When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while, good night.
sheldon_cooper So, how was your date?
leonard_hofstadter Awesome!
sheldon_cooper Score one for liquor and poor judgment.
