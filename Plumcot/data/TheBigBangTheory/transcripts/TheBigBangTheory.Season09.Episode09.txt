raj_koothrappali Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
howard_wolowitz No. How does it work?
raj_koothrappali You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?
siri#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 The time is 6:37 p.m.
howard_wolowitz So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
raj_koothrappali Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Cool. Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
raj_koothrappali I don’t sound like that.
siri#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 Here are some images of naked grandma butts.
sheldon_cooper Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?
leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re having everyone over.
penny Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.
leonard_hofstadter Otherwise we’d love to.
penny But we can’t.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, poor us.
penny Mm-hmm.
bernadette_rostenkowski And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.
sheldon_cooper Well, Howard, what about you?
howard_wolowitz Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too.
bernadette_rostenkowski You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
howard_wolowitz If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.
amy_farrah_fowler No one can go with you?
sheldon_cooper No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Okay. Thank you.
sheldon_cooper And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.
sheldon_cooper You don’t think that will be awkward?
amy_farrah_fowler Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine.
sheldon_cooper Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
amy_farrah_fowler See you then.
sheldon_cooper Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.
amy_farrah_fowler Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?
sheldon_cooper And there goes my list.
emily_sweeney So, how does this work?
bernadette_rostenkowski The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.
howard_wolowitz Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long.
raj_koothrappali Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
howard_wolowitz I happen to be a giving and generous lover.
emily_sweeney Are you and I close enough for me to say that’s creepy?
bernadette_rostenkowski We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.
soup_kitchen_manager#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 Uh, can I help you?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hi. We’d like to volunteer.
soup_kitchen_manager#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
howard_wolowitz Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
emily_sweeney Are you and I close enough for me to say…
bernadette_rostenkowski That he’s an ass? He beat you to it.
soup_kitchen_manager#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, great. We’d love to help.
howard_wolowitz Wipe that smug smile off your face.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t.
penny Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
leonard_hofstadter I know. I feel so grown up.
penny Sweetie, you are grown up.
leonard_hofstadter Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?
penny Yep. What’s the code?
leonard_hofstadter My birthday.
penny It’s not working.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just the four digits, month and day.
penny Nope.
leonard_hofstadter Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?
penny Uh.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t know my birthday, do you?
penny Yes, I do.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what is it?
penny May.
leonard_hofstadter May what?
penny I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
leonard_hofstadter You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
penny Well, you don’t know everything about me.
leonard_hofstadter Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.
penny Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
sheldon_cooper I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.
amy_farrah_fowler If that makes you more comfortable.
sheldon_cooper If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?
amy_farrah_fowler No. You?
sheldon_cooper No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?
amy_farrah_fowler I might go visit my aunt next week.
sheldon_cooper Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
amy_farrah_fowler No, the one in Bakersfield.
sheldon_cooper Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
soup_kitchen_manager#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 We’re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I’ll be around.
howard_wolowitz So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?
bernadette_rostenkowski What difference does it make?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.
raj_koothrappali You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!
howard_wolowitz It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing.
sheldon_cooper and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.
amy_farrah_fowler Are we done discussing the weather?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
sheldon_cooper All right. Well, what should we talk about?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.
sheldon_cooper Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
amy_farrah_fowler Man, I walked right into that one.
leonard_hofstadter Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.
penny Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?
leonard_hofstadter Baby.
penny Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?
leonard_hofstadter Justin.
penny Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?
leonard_hofstadter Nice try. NSYNC forever.
penny Damn it.
leonard_hofstadter Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…
penny Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?
leonard_hofstadter Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
penny Interesting. I never told you that.
leonard_hofstadter Sure you did.
penny No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
leonard_hofstadter What? I didn’t know you had a journal.
penny I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.
leonard_hofstadter No, it doesn’t.
raj_koothrappali You know, this reminds me of high school.
emily_sweeney You worked in a restaurant?
raj_koothrappali No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.
howard_wolowitz All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad.
emily_sweeney Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.
howard_wolowitz We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?
raj_koothrappali You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.
howard_wolowitz Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.
raj_koothrappali No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being.
howard_wolowitz Huh. Okay, I’ll try it.
soup_kitchen_manager#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 I need three people out front.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll do it.
raj_koothrappali Me.
emily_sweeney Right here!
howard_wolowitz No fair, I was meditating.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.
penny How can reading my journal be an accident?
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
penny Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?
leonard_hofstadter You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.
penny All right. Let’s just finish cooking.
leonard_hofstadter Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.
penny Okay, really, I’m fine.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.
penny Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”
penny Does it really say that?
leonard_hofstadter Why would I lie?
penny OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?
leonard_hofstadter Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.
sheldon_cooper I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
amy_farrah_fowler No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.
sheldon_cooper All right.
amy_farrah_fowler So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.
sheldon_cooper Just a few.
amy_farrah_fowler Go ahead.
sheldon_cooper How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
sheldon_cooper Is that regular or honey nut?
amy_farrah_fowler I mixed them.
sheldon_cooper You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
amy_farrah_fowler Just one. Are you doing okay?
sheldon_cooper I am.
amy_farrah_fowler Good. I want you to be happy.
sheldon_cooper I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 Here you go.
howard_wolowitz Thanks. You got to be kidding me.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 Sorry?
howard_wolowitz Y, you’re Elon Musk.
elon_musk I am.
howard_wolowitz Wh, what are you doing here?
elon_musk I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.
howard_wolowitz Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.
elon_musk Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?
howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer.
elon_musk And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
howard_wolowitz Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.
elon_musk Well, you’re here on Thanksgiving, so you’re probably a good person.
howard_wolowitz Oh. I made my wife come down, too.
elon_musk You think you might ever get back out to space?
howard_wolowitz Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.
elon_musk Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.
howard_wolowitz Thank you.
elon_musk Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?
howard_wolowitz A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.
sheldon_cooper You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
sheldon_cooper They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure. What is it?
sheldon_cooper It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.
amy_farrah_fowler So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
sheldon_cooper What is that?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill.
sheldon_cooper Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.
amy_farrah_fowler Let’s just play.
sheldon_cooper I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.
amy_farrah_fowler Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.
sheldon_cooper Very well done.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?
amy_farrah_fowler But you can pal around with a hagfish?
sheldon_cooper Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.
amy_farrah_fowler Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.
sheldon_cooper I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down.
amy_farrah_fowler I miss this.
sheldon_cooper How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?
amy_farrah_fowler I guess sometimes I’m silly.
penny Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
leonard_hofstadter Be right there. Hi, lover.
penny What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
penny I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?
bernadette_rostenkowski Happy Thanks… Yikes.
leonard_hofstadter I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.
sheldon_cooper Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.
penny Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s.
sheldon_cooper Did you have a nice time?
amy_farrah_fowler I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.
sheldon_cooper Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.
amy_farrah_fowler It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again.
sheldon_cooper Oh. I thought we were just friends.
amy_farrah_fowler We are. But I was hoping, maybe…
sheldon_cooper Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I understand.
sheldon_cooper Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Sure.
