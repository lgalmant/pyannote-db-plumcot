sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.
sheldon_cooper Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I’ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences.
penny You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you all set for your trip?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.
penny PRK?
leonard_hofstadter Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
sheldon_cooper I don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.
leonard_hofstadter Keep going.
sheldon_cooper And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let’s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo.
penny You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?
sheldon_cooper Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can’t Spy? It’s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.
leonard_hofstadter If it’s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I’m in.
sheldon_cooper I’ll begin. Uh, I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
leonard_hofstadter That soy Frappuccino I had.
sheldon_cooper Will you please play the game? I can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to play anymore.
leonard_hofstadter We haven’t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
sheldon_cooper We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.
leonard_hofstadter No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That’s pretty cool.
sheldon_cooper I suppose it is. In fact, if you’d like to celebrate with a little music, I’d be okay with that.
leonard_hofstadter What? This road trip just got crazy.
sheldon_cooper Play that funky music, white boy.
leonard_hofstadter I’m surprised you know that reference.
sheldon_cooper What reference?
bernadette_rostenkowski So, I put stickers on everything we’re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.
amy_farrah_fowler Can I be in charge of pricing? I’ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?
howard_wolowitz All right, Amy’s in charge of pricing and being 75.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?
penny Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.
penny Oh, I meant beer pong.
amy_farrah_fowler I had a table, too, but I didn’t have any friends, so all I did was serve.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.
amy_farrah_fowler And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.
howard_wolowitz Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It’s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think you just answered your own question.
howard_wolowitz Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don’t need to decide this right now.
howard_wolowitz Well, I guess as long as you’re keeping an open mind.
bernadette_rostenkowski Of course.
sheldon_cooper So they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper And this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
sheldon_cooper Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
leonard_hofstadter It could be.
sheldon_cooper So it’s like the musical equivalent of Russell’s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself?
leonard_hofstadter Exactly.
sheldon_cooper Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
leonard_hofstadter Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.
sheldon_cooper Will our hotel room be ready?
leonard_hofstadter I doubt it.
sheldon_cooper Aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
leonard_hofstadter If we do, we’ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?
sheldon_cooper Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won’t be very far from Skywalker Ranch.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s true. It’s not like we can get in there.
sheldon_cooper Why not?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
sheldon_cooper Yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That’s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.
leonard_hofstadter We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.
sheldon_cooper Yes. Oh, I’m so excited. And I just can’t hide it.
leonard_hofstadter I’m about to lose control, and I think I like it.
sheldon_cooper What are you talking about?
penny So when do you guys think you’re gonna move in?
howard_wolowitz We’re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.
howard_wolowitz We’re not selling it, it’s mine.
bernadette_rostenkowski You can’t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?
howard_wolowitz That’s not fair. It’s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.
raj_koothrappali You could play Ping-Pong for it.
howard_wolowitz I would do that.
bernadette_rostenkowski How is that fair? You grew up with a table.
howard_wolowitz Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.
penny Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, Penny plays for me.
howard_wolowitz That’s not fair, she has upper body muscles.
raj_koothrappali Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.
howard_wolowitz That’s right, okay, Raj can play for me.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, you just chose champions. It’s like we’re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.
penny Yeah, it’s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.
bernadette_rostenkowski Leonard makes you watch that, too?
penny No, no, I like that show. It’s got dragons and people doing it.
howard_wolowitz So it’s settled. The fate of Doctor Who’s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.
amy_farrah_fowler If you still have that bra, I’ll give you a nickel for it.
sheldon_cooper There it is. It’s just a gate. On a road.
leonard_hofstadter Wasn’t even that hard to find.
sheldon_cooper This is so amazing.
leonard_hofstadter I know. You want to get a picture?
sheldon_cooper I want more than a picture. I want to go in.
leonard_hofstadter Well, so do I, but they’ll never let us.
sheldon_cooper Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
leonard_hofstadter No, but I don’t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.
sheldon_cooper There’s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let’s see what happens.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I’m a little nervous.
sheldon_cooper Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.
leonard_hofstadter Right.
sheldon_cooper You pushed it, are you out of your mind?
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 May I help you?
leonard_hofstadter Um, uh, uh, uh, we don’t have an appointment, and, and we don’t belong here, but we, we’re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don’t want to look in.
sheldon_cooper You’re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 Hello? This speaker’s not working, just pull up.
leonard_hofstadter And that’s how it’s done.
sheldon_cooper All right, we’ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.
leonard_hofstadter We’re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.
sheldon_cooper I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what’s the plan?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I’m just gonna be honest with the guy.
sheldon_cooper Honesty will never get us in.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what’s your plan?
sheldon_cooper All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.
security_guard Who are you here to see?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I’m just gonna tell you the truth.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you are killing me.
leonard_hofstadter We don’t have an appointment. We, we’re just fans of Mr. Lucas’s work, and we thought we’d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.
security_guard Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can’t let you in.
sheldon_cooper What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, don’t listen to him. We’re actually physicists. We’re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.
security_guard Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can’t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best… What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.
security_guard Don’t move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 Copy.
sheldon_cooper I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it’s rustic, it’s lovely. I’d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I’m gonna make it. I’m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn’t dare use… Aaaaaaagh!
howard_wolowitz Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, ’cause I don’t have a third one. Yes. Woo.
amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh eight, Penny four.
penny Sorry, he’s really good.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Raj. if Howard can’t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?
raj_koothrappali What?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, what?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ’cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don’t know much about<i> Doctor Who.
howard_wolowitz Don’t listen to her. You and I go way back, we’re like brothers.
raj_koothrappali We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.
amy_farrah_fowler Eight-five.
howard_wolowitz This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, it, it’s been a long time. I don’t know. I’m probably pretty rusty.
penny Wow.
howard_wolowitz She’s my champion.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.
penny Hey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, come on, like you even care.
penny I care. Oh, wait, no, I don’t. Good luck, Raj.
howard_wolowitz You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.
raj_koothrappali So did I.
sheldon_cooper Do you think they’re gonna call the police?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Maybe they’ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I think that’s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…
leonard_hofstadter Oh, shut up.
nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 He’s right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh, I’m normally very nice, but you shut up, too.
sheldon_cooper So, what are you in for?
nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.
sheldon_cooper But why are you here?
nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.
security_guard All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we’re gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.
leonard_hofstadter We understand. Thank you so much.
nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode19 Uh, what about me?
security_guard No, you’re not going anywhere, kissy face. Let’s go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.
sheldon_cooper Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.
howard_wolowitz Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I’ve since turned mean, and now it’s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.
bernadette_rostenkowski Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn’t that right, Raj?
raj_koothrappali Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, I’m gonna own you, bitch.
penny Whoa.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s not nice.
raj_koothrappali Let’s just play.
howard_wolowitz One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t listen to him, all she’s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.
raj_koothrappali What, and that’s not offensive? Where’s the line?
penny It’s in your purse. Play.
bernadette_rostenkowski One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.
howard_wolowitz Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.
bernadette_rostenkowski Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.
howard_wolowitz It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, Amy, I, uh, can’t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.
howard_wolowitz Don’t listen to her, just hit the ball.
amy_farrah_fowler Keep talking.
bernadette_rostenkowski If this doesn’t get him into your bedroom, nothing will.
sheldon_cooper Are you still mad at me?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.
sheldon_cooper Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.
leonard_hofstadter The glass is empty, Sheldon. It’s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?
sheldon_cooper Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you’re looking at this all wrong.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.
sheldon_cooper Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.
leonard_hofstadter That part was pretty good.
sheldon_cooper See?
leonard_hofstadter You did flop around a lot.
sheldon_cooper I’ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
leonard_hofstadter You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I’m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.
sheldon_cooper That’s amazing.
leonard_hofstadter I know.
sheldon_cooper And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?
leonard_hofstadter I guess this could count as an adventure.
sheldon_cooper It was. And even though we’re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn’t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.
sheldon_cooper Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.
amy_farrah_fowler Really should have thought this through.
