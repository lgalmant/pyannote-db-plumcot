sheldon Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.
leonard Since when do you hum songs?
sheldon What are you talking about?
leonard You were just humming.
sheldon Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
leonard How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
sheldon Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?
leonard Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?
sheldon Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.
leonard Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
sheldon I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it. My country, ’tis of thee. No.
leonard It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.
sheldon Okay. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
leonard Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
sheldon I’m surprised you have to ask.
sheldon Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.
leonard Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.
penny Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
sheldon Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me.
penny I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself.
sheldon I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.
penny Public nudity?
leonard Eh, that just means going barefoot.
dave Hello?
amy Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy.
dave Oh. How are you?
amy I’m fine. How are you?
dave Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.
amy Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.
dave So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
amy Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime.
dave Yes, please.
amy Great.
dave Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.
amy How ’bout Saturday?
dave Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.
raj Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?
howard Really? Why?
raj They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
howard Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?
raj Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…
howard Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?
raj It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.
howard That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.
raj But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
howard All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together.
raj So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
howard We did raise the roof that night.
raj Yeah, we totally did.
howard Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
sheldon Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
leonard Put on some headphones.
sheldon No they make my earlobes sweat.
penny Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?
sheldon There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.
penny Okay, great. What is it?
sheldon I’ll show you. Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait. Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
penny I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
sheldon This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.
bernadette So, you’re really going out with Dave again?
amy Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.
bernadette But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.
amy That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again.
bernadette Okay. So where’s he taking you?
amy Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner.
bernadette Oh. That’s a big step.
amy It is?
bernadette Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.
amy You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.
bernadette You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?
amy Why not?
bernadette ‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.
raj Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
howard What should we write?
raj How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.
howard Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.
raj Well what do you want to write?
howard Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.
raj Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now.
howard I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.
raj Okay. I posted it.
howard So, who is this guy?
raj Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.
howard Cool name.
raj Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too.
howard Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.
raj He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
penny Oh, my God, he won’t stop.
leonard How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
penny Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?
leonard Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
penny Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
leonard What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.
penny Fine.
leonard I love you.
penny Who cares?
sheldon What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?
penny Problem solved.
leonard Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.
sheldon Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.
leonard Hey, can we please get back to work?
sheldon This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.
leonard All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.
sheldon Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon Oh, no, he’s drinking it.
howard Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
raj That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
bernadette Who’s Trent?
howard Oh, he’s our fan.
bernadette Fan of what?
howard Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.
bernadette You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
howard And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
raj Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.
howard Really? You want to go down there and meet him?
bernadette Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.
raj It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.
howard After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.
raj From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.
howard So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy.
bernadette Maybe I should marry Trent.
raj Yeah, like she could get Trent.
dave This is delicious.
amy Thank you.
dave Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.
amy When you were married, did your wife cook?
dave Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.
amy So, a little silver lining.
dave I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?
amy Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know.
dave I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.
amy Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.
dave Had to or got to? Sorry.
amy My fault. I brought him up.
dave Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?
sheldon Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?
leonard That’s a trick question, right?
sheldon Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.
penny Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.
leonard Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.
sheldon Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
penny Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
sheldon The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.
leonard There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
raj So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?
howard No. Let him spot us.
raj I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
howard Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.
raj And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!
howard I can’t watch.
raj It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.
howard Why is he looking at it?
raj Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?
howard Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.
raj Ooh!
howard Let’s just go.
trent Hey, aren’t you the guys?
howard Nope.
raj No, never heard of ’em!
sheldon I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
leonard I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.
penny Do you even like the Beach Boys?
sheldon They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
leonard Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?
sheldon Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.
penny Why?
sheldon It’s about Amy.
penny Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
sheldon It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”
penny She did soften your life, didn’t she?
sheldon Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
leonard Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
penny Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.
leonard Aw.
amy That’s an interesting tie clip.
dave Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.
amy No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.
dave Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.
amy No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous.
dave Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.
amy You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.
sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy?
amy That’s Sheldon.
dave You’re kidding. How’s my hair?
amy Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.
sheldon I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.
amy What?
dave If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me.
sheldon I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.
amy No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?
sheldon Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.
amy I really want that, too.
sheldon Good. Because I love you.
amy I love you, too.
dave Kiss her, you brilliant fool.
sheldon Well, I’ll let you get back to your date.
amy Get back here.
dave Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.
