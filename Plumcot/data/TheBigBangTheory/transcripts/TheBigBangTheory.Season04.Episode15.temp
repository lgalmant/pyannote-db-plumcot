raj Here’s what I wonder about zombies. What happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? They can’t starve to death, they’re already dead.
howard You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
sheldon Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
raj Yeah, okay, so, zombies.
leonard I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved.
howard You’re thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
raj Hey, don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.
leonard Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o’clock.
howard Why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
sheldon Perhaps he’s emulating Shakespeare’s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.
raj Or maybe he heard it’s Tator Tot Tuesday. That’s why I’m here.
dr_seibert Hey, there’s my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?
sheldon That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
seibert Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.
sheldon It’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,
seibert Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who’s up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.
raj Sounds great!
howard I’m in!
sheldon Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What’s the occasion?
seibert Just a little fund-raiser for the university.
sheldon Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
seibert I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.
sheldon I don’t care, it’s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign’s uniform.
seibert All right, let me put it this way. You’re gonna put on a suit, you’re gonna come to this party, and you’re gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I’ll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.
raj Oh, you don’t want that.
seibert So, Saturday night! It’s gonna be off the hook.
sheldon Ugh!
seibert Get over it.
raj Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!
penny There you go.
leonard Are you sure this is right?
penny Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants; you’ll be fine.
howard Okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.
penny Oh, Howard, I can’t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.
howard Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes. My mother does.
leonard Oh. We should get going.
howard What about Sheldon?
sheldon Sheldon is not going.
leonard Really? What do we tell Siebert?
sheldon Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
penny Sheldon, it’s Saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry.
sheldon Don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing.
howard Hey, put your tie back in your pants.
leonard Thanks.
raj Nice place. Reminds me of my parents’ house back in New Delhi.
howard You’re kidding.
raj No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.
leonard More than this?
raj More than we can use. You see, in India, we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
seibert Ah. There’s my band of brainiacs. Where’s Dr. Cooper?
leonard He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
seibert The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he’s just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university’s leading donors.
raj I think we were misled about the cute girls.
seibert Mrs. Latham, I’d like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.
mrs_latham Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn’t stick with it long enough to get your PhD?
howard I’m an engineer. Most engineers don’t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
mrs_latham Got it, you’re a space plumber.
howard I’m gonna go hit the bar.
mrs_latham Tell me about these two.
raj Do him first.
seibert Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you’ll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.
mrs_latham Right. Fascinate me.
leonard Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
mrs_latham They’re cute when they’re about to wet themselves, aren’t they? I’ll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?
leonard Coffee maker?
mrs_latham All right, Dr. Kooth… uh, whatever it is, you’re up.
raj It’s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
sheldon And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.
amy Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you’ve made a foolish mistake.
sheldon Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I’m not above minimizing your window.
amy Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
sheldon That’s it. Prepare to be minimized.
amy I’m not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?
sheldon Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
amy Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.
sheldon Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.
amy And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.
sheldon Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.
amy Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department.
sheldon Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!
amy Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.
sheldon No!
amy Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.
sheldon Oh, the humanities!
leonard On the bright side, I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.
howard It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.
raj Oh, don’t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?
leonard Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.
mrs_latham Oh, you didn’t do that badly.
leonard Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up.
mrs_latham I no longer care, dear. But don’t worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.
leonard You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
mrs_latham Excellent! There’s nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.
leonard Why?
mrs_latham Oh, I don’t know, it’s one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.
sheldon No, no, no, I’m just here for your money. I don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.
sheldon I must confess I don’t understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there’s simply no talking to me, why did you call? I’m sorry, someone’s on the other line. Why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we’ll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.
leonard Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don’t, I, I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure, that’d be great. Okay, I’ll, I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
sheldon An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?
leonard Well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up.
sheldon Okay, I see what’s happening.
leonard What?
sheldon My stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.
leonard Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
sheldon No, that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back, Jack.
leonard That was a great meal.
mrs_latham I’m glad you enjoyed it.
leonard The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
mrs_latham Is that so?
leonard You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.
mrs_latham Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.
leonard No kidding.
mrs_latham Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he’d had money.
leonard Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?
mrs_latham Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.
leonard Oh, good, good.
mrs_latham And I’m seriously considering taking it to the next level.
leonard Terrific. Great. What level is that? Okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom.
sheldon I’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?
penny Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.
sheldon You know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.
howard Hey. How was dinner?
leonard Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
sheldon No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It’ll take two weeks.
penny Leonard, are you okay?
leonard Um, I’m not sure.
howard What’s going on?
leonard Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
sheldon Oh, wow!
howard Yes!
leonard Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
sheldon Why?
penny Okay, we can’t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.
leonard She hit on me.
howard Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
leonard I think so.
howard You lucky duck.
penny You’re really a broken toy, aren’t you?
leonard I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
sheldon Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
leonard What?
sheldon Penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.
leonard Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her.
sheldon But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
leonard Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen.
sheldon Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!
leonard I repeat, not gonna happen.
penny What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
sheldon It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
sheldon Okay, fine. I’ll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham’s car is here for you.
leonard I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
sheldon Hold on, I have something for you.
leonard What’s this?
sheldon Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.
leonard I am not going to have sex with her.
sheldon Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
leonard Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
sheldon Oh, come on! Why not?
leonard Good night, Sheldon.
sheldon Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!
penny He still won’t shag the old lady, huh?
sheldon No. But thank you for asking.
leonard Hey. Hi.
mrs_latham Hello, Leonard. I hope you’re hungry.
leonard I’m very hungry. For food, right?
mrs_latham Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I’m so sorry.
leonard No, that’s okay.
mrs_latham No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I’m making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.
leonard Really?
mrs_latham Well, of course. There’s no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.
leonard Oh. Then what was last night about?
mrs_latham I took a shot, sue me.
leonard Oh.
mrs_latham You’re a very handsome man, Leonard.
leonard Thank you.
mrs_latham It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.
leonard Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman.
mrs_latham Oh, please.
leonard No, it’s true.
mrs_latham Well, aren’t you sweet. Just for the record, you’d remember a night with me for the rest of your life.
leonard I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?
mrs_latham You’re a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?
leonard I hadn’t really given it much thought.
mrs_latham Well, think about it.
leonard Do you mean?
mrs_latham Yep. I’m that good.
leonard Oh, what the hell.
penny Good morning, slut.
leonard What?
penny Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
sheldon What’s going on?
leonard Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me.
sheldon Are you just getting home?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon That’s a good sign, right?
penny Oh, yeah.
sheldon I’m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
leonard No, I didn’t do it for the money.
sheldon She stiffed you?
penny I believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
sheldon What?
penny Again, read the book we gave you.
leonard No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.
sheldon Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah.
