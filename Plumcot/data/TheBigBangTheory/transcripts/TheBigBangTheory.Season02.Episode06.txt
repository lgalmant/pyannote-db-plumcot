leonard_hofstadter So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
sheldon_cooper Forget it.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
sheldon_cooper It’s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
leonard_hofstadter If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store.
sheldon_cooper Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, good God.
sheldon_cooper In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?
raj_koothrappali I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air.
howard_wolowitz Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.
raj_koothrappali Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
leonard_hofstadter No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
raj_koothrappali Damn, there’s always a catch.
leslie_winkle Hey, guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Leslie.
leslie_winkle So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.
sheldon_cooper The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
leslie_winkle Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you’re just brilliant.
sheldon_cooper That is the prevailing opinion.
leslie_winkle Oh, now I’m gonna throw up.
howard_wolowitz Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System.
ramona_nowitzki Ew. Dr. Cooper, I’ve read everything you’ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?
sheldon_cooper Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.
howard_wolowitz Woof.
sheldon_cooper The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
ramona_nowitzki Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.
sheldon_cooper It’s what I do.
howard_wolowitz You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.
ramona_nowitzki Again, ew. You know, I’d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
sheldon_cooper I don’t drink coffee.
howard_wolowitz I do. I love me a cup of joe.
ramona_nowitzki Well, it doesn’t have to be coffee. How about dinner?
sheldon_cooper I do eat dinner.
ramona_nowitzki Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.
sheldon_cooper I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
ramona_nowitzki Excuse me?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
sheldon_cooper Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
ramona_nowitzki What if I brought food to your place?
sheldon_cooper That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.
ramona_nowitzki You got it. I already have your address.
sheldon_cooper What a nice girl.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
penny Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order. See? Sorry.
ramona_nowitzki That’s okay. Guess I’m taking the stairs.
penny Where you going?
ramona_nowitzki 4-A.
penny Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
ramona_nowitzki No, Dr. Cooper.
penny Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
ramona_nowitzki We’re having dinner.
penny Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
ramona_nowitzki He is cute, isn’t he?
penny Sheldon Cooper?
ramona_nowitzki Hi, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
ramona_nowitzki Thanks. Where should I put this?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, the kitchen’s fine. Hey, what are you doing?
penny I need to see this.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hello.
ramona_nowitzki Oh, sorry I’m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.
sheldon_cooper Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
ramona_nowitzki So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.
sheldon_cooper My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
ramona_nowitzki I’m sorry I didn’t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.
howard_wolowitz To watch, right?
leonard_hofstadter No, come on, now, we’re going out.
penny Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet.
leonard_hofstadter Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.
penny Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what’s Sheldon’s deal?
leonard_hofstadter What do you mean “deal”?
penny You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
leonard_hofstadter Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
penny Come on, everybody has a deal.
howard_wolowitz Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis.
penny I’m sorry?
howard_wolowitz I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
leonard_hofstadter On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
penny Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
penny What are you guys gonna do?
leonard_hofstadter Uh…
howard_wolowitz My mom’s making a brisket tonight.
leonard_hofstadter The one with the little onions? Mmm.
penny Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight.
howard_wolowitz Her loss. Let’s go.
raj_koothrappali Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
leonard_hofstadter Don’t.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
sheldon_cooper Not in these pants.
leonard_hofstadter So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?
sheldon_cooper Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.
ramona_nowitzki Here’s your spinach mushroom omelette .
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
ramona_nowitzki Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.
sheldon_cooper Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
ramona_nowitzki Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.
sheldon_cooper You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.
leonard_hofstadter Touche.
leslie_winkle Morning.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, hey Leslie.
leslie_winkle So, Sheldon, I see you’re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.
ramona_nowitzki There won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good one.
leslie_winkle I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I’ll let you keep your lunch money today.
ramona_nowitzki Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you’re going to stay, you’ll have to be respectful and quiet.
leonard_hofstadter Wait for me.
ramona_nowitzki So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
sheldon_cooper Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.
ramona_nowitzki You’re so witty.
sheldon_cooper Aren’t I?
penny Hey, guys, this package came for y…
ramona_nowitzki Dr. Cooper is working.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles
penny Sorry. Holy crap on a cracker.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny.
penny Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there.
leonard_hofstadter Why? What are they doing?
penny You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.
leonard_hofstadter Hoo-boy.
ramona_nowitzki Dr. Cooper’s working.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.
ramona_nowitzki You’re not going to Halo night.
sheldon_cooper Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>
ramona_nowitzki Didn’t a great man once say, “Science demands nothing less than the fervent and
sheldon_cooper He did.
ramona_nowitzki And who was that great man?
sheldon_cooper Me. Sorry, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously? You’re not coming?
sheldon_cooper You heard her. How can I argue with me?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.
ramona_nowitzki Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.
sheldon_cooper I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
ramona_nowitzki Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games.
sheldon_cooper He does on Wednesdays.
ramona_nowitzki Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
sheldon_cooper He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
ramona_nowitzki What do you think?
sheldon_cooper Drat.
ramona_nowitzki Now shall we get back to work?
sheldon_cooper I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. I guess I can wait for the DVD. And then never ever watch it.
montage_of_scenes#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 To the sound of “You Can Be My Yoko Ono” by Barenaked Ladies we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear,sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.
sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny
penny Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
sheldon_cooper Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.
penny Get rid of her how?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.
penny Excuse me?
sheldon_cooper I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
penny Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
ramona_nowitzki Dr. Cooper?!
sheldon_cooper Hide me.
penny Hide you?
sheldon_cooper I formally request sanctuary.
ramona_nowitzki Why aren’t you working?
sheldon_cooper Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.
penny Oh, man.
ramona_nowitzki I know what’s going on here.
penny Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?
ramona_nowitzki You’re in love with Dr. Cooper.
penny Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it.
ramona_nowitzki Don’t try to deny it. He’s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.
penny Oh, gee, okay.
ramona_nowitzki I know it’s hard, but he’s a gift to the whole world, and we can’t be selfish.
penny Yeah, he’s a gift all right.
ramona_nowitzki Sisters?
penny Um, sure, sisters. Holy crap on a cracker.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? What are you doing?!
sheldon_cooper It’s Morse code.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper So we can communicate through the wall.
leonard_hofstadter We are communicating through the wall.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know Morse code.
sheldon_cooper It’s very simple. This is A this is B this is C…
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!
sheldon_cooper All right.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t Aw! What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
leonard_hofstadter I know. When is she going home?
sheldon_cooper Never, that’s the problem. I need your help.
leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
sheldon_cooper I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
leonard_hofstadter That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
sheldon_cooper Come on! Don’t nitpick!
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
sheldon_cooper Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.
leonard_hofstadter The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
sheldon_cooper Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here.
ramona_nowitzki Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
sheldon_cooper Now! Do it!
ramona_nowitzki You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
sheldon_cooper Godzilla clause?
leonard_hofstadter Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
sheldon_cooper Rats.
sheldon_cooper I’ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
ramona_nowitzki It’s unbelievable! It’s paradigm-altering!
sheldon_cooper And I could not have done it without you.
ramona_nowitzki Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.
sheldon_cooper It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?
ramona_nowitzki Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?
sheldon_cooper Who’s Nowitzki?
ramona_nowitzki I’m Nowitzki.
sheldon_cooper Oh, you want me to share credit?
ramona_nowitzki Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper Get out!
penny Oh, hey, hi.
ramona_nowitzki Oh, bite me!
penny Sisters?
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Kathy O’Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.
sheldon_cooper Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler.
kathy_obrien Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
sheldon_cooper Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
kathy_obrien Great. I’ll bring it to your place. I have the address.
sheldon_cooper What a nice girl.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll.
sheldon_cooper More Pad Thai, please.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you’ve already had four servings.
raj_koothrappali You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
sheldon_cooper Just one more bite.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon_cooper I’m just so… full.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it. No more Thai food.
