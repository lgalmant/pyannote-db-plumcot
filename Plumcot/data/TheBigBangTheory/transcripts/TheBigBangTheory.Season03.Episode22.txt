penny Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet.
leonard_hofstadter It’s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
sheldon_cooper Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
sheldon_cooper This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
leonard_hofstadter Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
sheldon_cooper No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
sheldon_cooper I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!
penny Who is it?
leonard_hofstadter Leonard.
penny Hang on.
leonard_hofstadter Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
penny Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
leonard_hofstadter You heard that, huh?
penny Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
leonard_hofstadter So you agree, he’s nuts.
penny Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
leonard_hofstadter Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
penny Oh, I do not believe that.
leonard_hofstadter You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. I’d just started at the university.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment.
man_with_a_box#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, I bet you’re here to check out the room for rent.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yeah.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Run away, dude.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Run fast, run far.
leonard_hofstadter That should have been my first clue.
penny So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
leonard_hofstadter For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
penny Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Sure, it makes sense now. . Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
large_black_transvestite#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yeah?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Dr. Cooper?
transvestite#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.
leonard_hofstadter In retrospect, that was clue number two.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yes?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Uh, radon?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Are you asking me or telling me?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Telling you? Telling you.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 That depends.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 There’s three?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Okay.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 No! That’s where I sit!
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What’s the difference?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Can you do that?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Uh, yeah, experimental physics.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Hmm.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What is that?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yes.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 And you have a vehicle?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 A car, yeah.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 And you’ll be willing to drive me?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Well, can’t you drive?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I can. I choose not to.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Why don’t you let me do this.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Come on, I just asked.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, good. I passed the barriers.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Uh, I guess.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 When I have to.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Fine. I’ll take it.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Is this it?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 So where do you sleep?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I don’t understand.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Do you do this often?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 On occasion.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Your room. You may want to repaint.
penny Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?
leonard_hofstadter No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Does that really need to be in the agreement?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 We have a flag?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Okay.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Well that’s disappointing.
penny Why on earth did you agree to all that?
leonard_hofstadter It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
penny Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Leonard?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Leonard?Leonard?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I’m sure he’ll go away.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What do you want? I didn’t say come in!
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
joyce_kim That’s it! I’m out of here!
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 But, Joyce, come on.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 12 hours?
penny Oh, my God.
leonard_hofstadter Do I get some sympathy now?
penny A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?
leonard_hofstadter Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
penny Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.
penny What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
leonard_hofstadter As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.
penny So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
leonard_hofstadter That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
penny Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
leonard_hofstadter It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work…
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What is going on here?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Hey.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Hey.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yeah, not a good idea.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Tushie is buttocks, right?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Right.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Hilarious.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Explain the couch.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Did it occur to you that was by design?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I did notify you.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What am I doing in your spam folder?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious.
penny Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?
leonard_hofstadter I’m getting to it.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yes.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 And you just assume you’re always right?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Why?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Fine.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Why not?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Because no one likes Babylon 5.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I like it.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Me, too.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 So do I.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 There you go– three against one.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 But I said no to that.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Why?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 There’s a draft on my neck over here.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 So, I get the draft?
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You’re protected by your turtleneck.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Fine. And it’s a dickey.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 We can fix that. Let’s leave.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Yeah, we can go over to my place.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Wait. Let me get my jacket.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You’re not going with us.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Why not?
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot.
penny Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
penny Fine. Go ahead.
howard_wolowitz Howard, are you having a playdate?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!
howard_wolowitz Do their parents know they’re here?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 That your dad?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 She grows any more hair on her face, yes.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Three. I designed the engine myself.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh, this just might be your lucky day.
howard_wolowitz Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 I haven’t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them!
penny So, why was it his lucky day?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
penny What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
leonard_hofstadter Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
penny Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Nice.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Cool.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Won’t work.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You don’t see your mistake, do you?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 There’s no mistake.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Well, I’ve adjusted the formula.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Not correctly.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What’s happening?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
past_howard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You’re waiting for the elevator?
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Oh. Right.
past_raj#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Wait. It’s here.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Give me that.
past_leonard#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time.
past_sheldon#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 You’re welcome.
leonard_hofstadter Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
penny Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
leonard_hofstadter So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
penny Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community.
past_penny#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Not pregnant. Yes!
sheldon_cooper Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
sheldon_cooper There’s doubt?
leonard_hofstadter I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.
sheldon_cooper That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper There you go.
leonard_hofstadter So, we’re good?
sheldon_cooper Good what?
leonard_hofstadter Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
sheldon_cooper Go ahead.
television_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 Up next Babylon 5.
leonard_hofstadter You’re not even watching!
sheldon_cooper I can hear it!
leonard_hofstadter Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
sheldon_cooper I would hardly call that dialogue!
leonard_hofstadter You’re insane, you know that?!
sheldon_cooper Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!
