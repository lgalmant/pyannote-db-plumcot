raj I’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.
sheldon Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
raj Oh, you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
sheldon You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
howard I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
leonard Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
raj Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
sheldon Oh, Penny? Penny?
penny What’s up?
sheldon Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
howard No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.
penny Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.
leonard Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
penny You want the fruit platter?
leonard Does it have melon on it?
penny Yeah.
leonard No, I can’t eat melon.
penny Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
leonard When was the last time you saw her?
howard Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? .
bernadette Hi, guys.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
raj It’s one of his best moves.
howard So, my dear, we meet again.
katee_sackhoff Hello, Howard. I’ve missed you.
howard I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.
katee_sackhoff One question.
howard Anything.
katee_sackhoff Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?
howard Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.
katee_sackhoff Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.
howard Okay, if you insist.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, have you seen my girdle?!
howard No, Ma!
mrs_wolowitz I can’t find it, and I’m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!
howard Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?
bernadette I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
howard Bernadette? What are you doing here?
katee_sackhoff Well, if I had to guess, I’d say I’m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you’re still hung up on me.
howard No, I’m not.
bernadette Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now.
howard Okay, I’m a little confused here.
george_takei Oh, my. Can I help?
howard Not that kind of confused.
bernadette What’s George Takei doing here?
katee_sackhoff Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?
howard No, of course not.
george_takei So you say. Yet, here I am.
katee_sackhoff George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?
george_takei It’s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O’Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.
katee_sackhoff Tell me about it. It’s frackin’ frustrating.
howard Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?
bernadette She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!
howard Great, Ma!
mrs_wolowitz I think it shrunk! I’m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
howard And with that mental picture, I think we’re done for the evening.
leonard You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.
howard I did a stupid thing.
leonard Yeah, I guessed that.
howard It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
leonard That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.
howard No. Stop asking.
leonard All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.
howard In a nutshell.
leonard Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.
howard Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not.
raj You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
sheldon Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
raj You have a desk.
sheldon Correct.
raj But I can’t have one.
sheldon You’re two for two.
leonard Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?
sheldon Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
raj Oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
sheldon Yes.
howard Okay, what if he buys his own desk?
raj Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?
sheldon That’s ridiculous.
howard Why?
sheldon Because…
raj Yes?
sheldon It’s my office.
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
raj And I can put it in your office?
sheldon Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?
leonard Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
sheldon They do some of their best work at night.
penny Ah, it’s okay.
sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny?
howard Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
penny Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
howard I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
penny Oh, absolutely.
howard She does?
penny Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?
howard She saw that, huh?
penny Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.
howard Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
penny Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?
howard Oh, I’d rather not say.
penny Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened.
howard But it’s embarrassing.
penny Yeah, that’s what I’m counting on. Spill.
howard Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?
penny Um, the online game? Sure.
howard Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?
penny Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.
howard Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
penny Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing.
howard Would you talk to her?
penny Bernadette or the troll?
howard Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story.
penny Well, what was your side?
howard Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.
penny Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?
howard Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?
penny Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.
howard No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.
penny Okay, I will think about it.
howard You know, I’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn’t the son he wanted.
penny Yeah, I said I’d think about it.
howard I wasn’t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.
penny Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?
howard Thank you.
leonard So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
sheldon One question.
leonard Yeah?
sheldon Why on earth are you telling me all this?
leonard I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy.
raj You said I could buy a desk.
sheldon This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
raj Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?
sheldon It’s actually British.
raj Can you say it again for me?
sheldon Brobdingnagian.
raj One more time?
sheldon Brobdingnagian.
raj Now three times fast?
sheldon Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?
raj That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
sheldon All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.
raj No.
sheldon Yes.
raj No.
sheldon Yes.
raj No.
sheldon Yes.
raj I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.
sheldon All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you.
raj Knock yourself out.
sheldon Help me move my desk.
raj No.
sheldon Yes.
raj No.
sheldon Yes.
raj No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
sheldon Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
raj Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I’d say it’s spot-on.
sheldon All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
raj Thank you.
sheldon Stand by for my upcoming tat.
raj Hey, Sheldon?
sheldon Yes?
raj No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
bernadette Sorry, I had to clock out.
howard Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?
bernadette Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?
howard Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I’m terrified of the ocean.
bernadette Too bad.
howard You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?
bernadette Well, to be honest, I…
penny Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?
howard Not for me, thanks.
bernadette I’m okay.
penny Are you gonna want to order food?
howard Maybe later.
penny Okay.
howard So, are you seeing anybody?
bernadette No.
penny That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.
bernadette No, it’s fine.
howard Penny, can we have a little privacy?
penny Oh. I’m sorry.
bernadette What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
howard Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…
bernadette So you’ve been seeing other girls?
howard Well, not real girls.
bernadette Does that mean slutty trolls?
penny You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.
bernadette Thank you.
penny It’s passion fruit, new on the menu.
bernadette I know. I work here.
penny Oh, sorry. Yeah, you’re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?
howard Isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
penny Not where I can hear you guys.
howard Okay, fine. I’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I’ve ever gone there is because I don’t have a real woman in my life. You happy?
penny Yeah, that’ll hold me for a while.
bernadette Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out.
howard Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…
bernadette Had sex?
howard Yeah.
bernadette Well, whose fault was that?
penny Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
howard What do you mean, whose fault was that?
bernadette Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move.
howard I didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
bernadette Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move.
howard Really?
bernadette Really.
howard Son of a bitch.
penny Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you’re ready.
howard Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again.
leonard Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?
howard Did Penny tell you about that?
leonard No. Steve Patterson told me.
howard The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
leonard Yeah.
howard How’d he know about it?
leonard He’s Glissinda the troll.
raj Sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!
sheldon I’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
raj Oh, too bad! Sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!
sheldon That’s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
raj Eat flaming Nerf!
leonard So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette.
howard Yeah. I think I’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
leonard Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf.
howard Short jokes? Really? You’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.
leonard Yeah, and don’t you forget it.
howard I had a good time.
bernadette Me, too.
katee_sackhoff Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.
george_takei Hold on there. We’ve only just rekindled the romance. Let’s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.
katee_sackhoff Don’t listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.
george_takei Mm-mmm. Too soon.
katee_sackhoff Trust me, she’s ready. Make the move.
george_takei No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.
katee_sackhoff How would you know?
george_takei I read.
katee_sackhoff Listen to me, Howard, it’s time. Make the move, now.
bernadette Mm! What are you doing?
howard You said, well, the move, remember?
bernadette Oh, not now. We’re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.
howard No, you don’t. It’s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.
