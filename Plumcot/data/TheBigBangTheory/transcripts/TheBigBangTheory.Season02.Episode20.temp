sheldon Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
leonard Problem?
sheldon This is Thai food.
howard Here we go.
sheldon We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
leonard Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
sheldon Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
howard Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.
sheldon Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
raj I could go for some goat.
leonard Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight.
sheldon All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
raj We went to the comic book store last night.
sheldon Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday.
leonard Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
raj So what are we going to do tonight?
howard If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.
leonard Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
howard Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
sheldon The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?
howard Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.
raj The Wolowitz Coefficient?
howard Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.
leonard You’re joking.
howard I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.
raj Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.
leonard You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!
raj Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
leonard Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
raj Also a good plan.
howard Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar.
leonard Oh, absolutely.
raj You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!
sheldon Fascinating.
penny Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?
sheldon To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
penny You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
sheldon I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
penny Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
leonard Sure. What does he like?
penny I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.
sheldon Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.
penny Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
sheldon Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?
penny Leonard?
leonard You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?
penny Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid.
sheldon Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.
penny Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me.
leonard Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them.
penny Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?
sheldon A superb choice.
penny Oh, great.
sheldon Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.
penny What’s a multiverse?
sheldon Get her out of here.
leonard Come on, I’ll help you pick something.
raj That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
howard Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.
store_clerk Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?
leonard Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books.
stuart Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will.
leonard I think we’re fine, Stuart.
stuart Let me know if you need anything.
penny Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
leonard You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
penny No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.
leonard Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
penny What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
leonard Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.
howard Let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
howard Yes, but I saw it from the front.
sheldon A far less impressive feat.
howard Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.
sheldon I need it for my Robin collection.
howard Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
sheldon Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
howard You let go.
sheldon No, you!
leonard Problem?
sheldon Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book.
howard It’s my comic book!
sheldon Leonard, we need a ruling.
leonard Uh, cut it in half?
penny Excuse me.
stuart Hello again.
penny Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
stuart A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic book, try this.
penny Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?
stuart A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.
penny Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?
stuart Depends. Do you like it?
penny It’s really good.
stuart Yes, that’s you.
penny That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?
stuart It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot.
leonard I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
howard I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
sheldon Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.
raj Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?
leonard Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go.
penny Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture.
stuart You drive a hard bargain, but here.
penny All right. So, um, just give me a call.
sheldon So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
sheldon Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?
leonard Apparently so.
sheldon Are you ill?
leonard No.
sheldon All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
leonard When did you pick up on that?
sheldon A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
leonard Sure, why not?
sheldon Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
leonard Gee, thanks a lot.
sheldon Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
leonard I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
sheldon Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.
leonard You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
sheldon My original point.
sheldon Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.
howard Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
penny Oh, hey guys.
leonard Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
stuart Hey, guys.
howard So what are you kids up to?
penny Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight.
leonard And you guys are going together, great…
stuart It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?
penny It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
sheldon Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.
penny Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.
stuart Yeah, see you guys.
howard See you, Stuart.
leonard Hey, Howard?
howard Yes.
leonard Take me to a bar with women.
howard Really?
leonard Yeah.
howard Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
leonard Why?
howard Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.
leonard Do you…? Let’s go.
raj May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?
howard No, he may not.
raj Why?
howard I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
raj Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
howard Wrong again!
raj Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.
howard Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them.
raj Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
howard All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.
leonard Should we talk to some of these women?
howard It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.
leonard That’s your system?
howard That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine.
penny Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
stuart Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese.
penny Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
stuart Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?
penny Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
sheldon Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
stuart Uh, yeah, I guess.
penny Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…
sheldon What are you doing?
stuart We’re having coffee.
sheldon Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
stuart It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.
penny I’ll just go look for it.
stuart What’s up?
sheldon Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.
stuart Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the topic?
sheldon I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
stuart Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong.
sheldon More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
stuart Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
sheldon Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
penny I found the decaf!
stuart Oh, great!
sheldon Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.
raj Barkeep! Alexander me.
leonard How about those two?
howard Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.
leonard What about the ones in the corner?
howard Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?
leonard I think Blinky’s cute.
howard You got it, sir.
leonard Wait, so we just go over there?
howard No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires.
leonard What else you got?
howard Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
leonard No.
howard I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine.
stuart I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.
sheldon Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
stuart Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right.
sheldon Au contraire.
stuart Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.
sheldon I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
stuart Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get some sleep.
sheldon So, I win.
stuart No, I’m tired.
sheldon So, I win.
stuart Fine. You win.
sheldon Darn tootin’, I win.
stuart Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?
sheldon No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.
stuart You know, I don’t think that was decaf.
howard Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was their card.
leonard I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
howard I do, all the time.
leonard Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called.
howard Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?
leonard Say what?
howard You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
leonard Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
howard Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt.
leonard Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
howard Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go. Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent of his. Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped.
