sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?
man I don’t think so.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?
leonard_hofstadter Morning.
penny Hi. Want to do yoga with me?
leonard_hofstadter Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that. Hello?
sheldon_cooper Hello, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.
sheldon_cooper Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.
leonard_hofstadter I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, are you okay?
sheldon_cooper No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?
penny Hey, what’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter He got all of his stuff stolen.
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper Hurry.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll be there as soon as I can.
penny Is he okay?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
penny I can’t, I have that job interview.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, right.
penny Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back.
leonard_hofstadter All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?
penny Nope.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, you didn’t even try.
raj_koothrappali Thanks for the lift.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong with your car?
raj_koothrappali I’m having my windows untinted.
howard_wolowitz Why?
raj_koothrappali Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
howard_wolowitz What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you.
raj_koothrappali Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work.
howard_wolowitz I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.
raj_koothrappali I thought Stuart was looking after her.
howard_wolowitz He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.
raj_koothrappali How so?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know, they’re, chummy.
raj_koothrappali Like us?
howard_wolowitz No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.
raj_koothrappali She feeds him out of her own mouth?
howard_wolowitz I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.
raj_koothrappali So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
howard_wolowitz First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.
raj_koothrappali Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…
howard_wolowitz I said well past it.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?
officer_hernandez Not yet.
sheldon_cooper Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?
officer_hernandez Nope.
sheldon_cooper Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
amy_farrah_fowler My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, time’s gonna fly by.
penny I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.
penny I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.
bernadette_rostenkowski This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.
penny They do?
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you.
penny Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.
penny I wish I felt more confident.
bernadette_rostenkowski Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I didn’t think you could handle it.
penny Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s too late to cancel. You’re going.
penny But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?
penny They’re comfortable.
howard_wolowitz Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.
stuart_bloom Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?
howard_wolowitz Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn’t have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.
howard_wolowitz It’s not that precious.
raj_koothrappali I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.
debbie_wolowitz Stewie, I can’t find my glasses.
stuart_bloom Be right there, Deb Deb. They’re probably on her head.
howard_wolowitz Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.
stuart_bloom Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you’d know.
raj_koothrappali It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
sheldon_cooper Any word on my stolen items?
officer_hernandez We’re doing everything we can.
sheldon_cooper You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you okay?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?
amy_farrah_fowler What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?
sheldon_cooper I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.
amy_farrah_fowler Fine. Whisper it.
sheldon_cooper Shotgun.
leonard_hofstadter So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?
sheldon_cooper Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.
leonard_hofstadter How were they?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
sheldon_cooper Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, so you never went outside?
sheldon_cooper Or had a single piece of fruit.
dan So, why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?
penny Well, I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I’m done.
dan You sure?
penny People. Yes.
dan Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?
penny Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.
dan Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.
penny People.
howard_wolowitz It’s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.
raj_koothrappali That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.
howard_wolowitz Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They’re both adults.
howard_wolowitz Who cares? You wouldn’t care if I slept with your mom?
raj_koothrappali You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.
howard_wolowitz This is stupid. I’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
raj_koothrappali ‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
stuart_bloom This is Debbie.
debbie_wolowitz And this is Stuart.
together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 Just kidding.
stuart_bloom Leave a message.
raj_koothrappali This is the part where you talk.
dan All right, let’s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor’s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?
penny Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time.
dan Don’t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.
penny Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of her.
dan Wait, wait. You’re scared of Bernadette?
penny Yeah, kind of.
dan I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she’s so nice with that squeaky little voice.
penny I know, but she’s kind of a bully.
dan Wll, she is. I didn’t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.
penny Me, too.
dan Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.
penny What happened?
dan I couldn’t do it. She’s still working on it. Oh, we’re not gonna tell her about this, right?
penny Oh, my God, no.
sheldon_cooper At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t care.
sheldon_cooper Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?
amy_farrah_fowler Have you not noticed that I’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
sheldon_cooper I just thought you were bad at the game.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?
sheldon_cooper Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?
amy_farrah_fowler We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?
sheldon_cooper Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the big deal?
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me.
amy_farrah_fowler Can I stop now?
leonard_hofstadter Just tell her.
sheldon_cooper I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.
amy_farrah_fowler You were worried about that?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect.
sheldon_cooper Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
sheldon_cooper Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
howard_wolowitz Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of excited to see Sheldon.
bernadette_rostenkowski I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job today.
howard_wolowitz She did?
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.
howard_wolowitz What do you want?
stuart_bloom I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom’s.
howard_wolowitz You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie?
howard_wolowitz It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?
stuart_bloom Hey, you’re not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking…
howard_wolowitz Your mother and I? You’re not my father.
stuart_bloom I didn’t say I was your father.
howard_wolowitz Well, I didn’t say I was your father.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father.
stuart_bloom I, I’m sorry you don’t like my life choices, but it’s my life.
howard_wolowitz Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules.
stuart_bloom Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him.
stuart_bloom I don’t have to listen to you.
howard_wolowitz Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.
stuart_bloom You know what? This isn’t getting us anywhere. When you’re ready to apologize, you know where to find me.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, in my house.
stuart_bloom That’s right, sucka.
sheldon_cooper I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.
amy_farrah_fowler But you still accomplished something.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?
sheldon_cooper That I couldn’t do it?
leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure.
sheldon_cooper That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.
amy_farrah_fowler See? This trip was good for you.
sheldon_cooper Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.
leonard_hofstadter Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.
all@ Hey.
penny Hey, look who’s back.
sheldon_cooper Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.
sheldon_cooper Would you like to see pictures from my trip?
penny I thought your phone got stolen.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.
leonard_hofstadter And you thought they all had a silver lining.
sheldon_cooper Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.
penny I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
sheldon_cooper I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out.
