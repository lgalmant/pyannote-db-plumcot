raj_koothrappali Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.
howard_wolowitz You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
leonard_hofstadter Good point, I’m in.
raj_koothrappali You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
leonard_hofstadter You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
raj_koothrappali Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.
howard_wolowitz Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
leonard_hofstadter It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
howard_wolowitz They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
raj_koothrappali We were badass back in the day.
leonard_hofstadter All right, let’s do it.
howard_wolowitz 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
raj_koothrappali It’s on like Alderaan.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon
raj_koothrappali Woo-hoo!
sheldon_cooper Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
leonard_hofstadter We are going to play the online game.
sheldon_cooper The online game? Bully!
amy_farrah_fowler Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party.
sheldon_cooper Just tell her I can’t come.
amy_farrah_fowler She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
sheldon_cooper She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.
amy_farrah_fowler No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none.
sheldon_cooper Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.
amy_farrah_fowler You use it to get your way.
sheldon_cooper I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
amy_farrah_fowler You gave me your word. You’re coming with me.
leonard_hofstadter We’ll miss you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!
sheldon_cooper Hello Stuart.
stuart_bloom Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?
stuart_bloom Uh, I don’t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
sheldon_cooper Do you supply the the tennis ball?
stuart_bloom No.
sheldon_cooper Then no. What else?
stuart_bloom Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
sheldon_cooper Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
stuart_bloom I’m sorry Sheldon, that’s it. That’s all I got.
sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
leonard_hofstadter I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
sheldon_cooper No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom.
leonard_hofstadter That’s what your father used to say?
sheldon_cooper Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.
howard_wolowitz Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.
raj_koothrappali I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
howard_wolowitz Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.
penny You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.
penny Really, what were you hoping for?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
penny Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again.
leonard_hofstadter Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
penny Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.
leonard_hofstadter Ay papi? What is that?
penny An acting choice.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
penny Choo got a problem with that, papi?
leonard_hofstadter Uh-uh.
sheldon_cooper Penny! Penny! Penny!
penny Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
penny Gummy bears? Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party.
penny Not a chance.
sheldon_cooper All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.
leonard_hofstadter Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once.
penny All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship.
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?
penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
sheldon_cooper When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
sheldon_cooper All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.
penny What’s that?
sheldon_cooper I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
amy_farrah_fowler Good morning.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth.
sheldon_cooper All right.
amy_farrah_fowler You sure you’re okay with this?
sheldon_cooper Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. That means a lot to me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
sheldon_cooper Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry.
raj_koothrappali Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.
leonard_hofstadter You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
raj_koothrappali Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
sheldon_cooper Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
howard_wolowitz Hey, guys, I got a surprise.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.
howard_wolowitz No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.
raj_koothrappali What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
howard_wolowitz I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now.
sheldon_cooper Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny. I was wrong, it’s still funny.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Hah-hah!
penny Amy, what’s wrong?
amy_farrah_fowler My boyfriend’s a jerk.
penny Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?
amy_farrah_fowler I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?
penny Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
amy_farrah_fowler The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
penny I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that’s good.
penny Mm.
amy_farrah_fowler I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
penny Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all.
amy_farrah_fowler Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper.
penny Yes. On purpose.
amy_farrah_fowler He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.
penny Well, sickly is the new sexy.
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah.
penny Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
penny That’s hilarious. No.
bernadette_rostenkowski Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
sheldon_cooper Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Pew!
leonard_hofstadter Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
raj_koothrappali Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff.
leonard_hofstadter All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match.
howard_wolowitz But I worked hard to get this armour.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple.
howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll change.
sheldon_cooper Hah-hah!
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think I want to play a game.
penny Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…
amy_farrah_fowler Like that?
penny Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
amy_farrah_fowler Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.
penny Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on.
amy_farrah_fowler That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
penny Wars.
amy_farrah_fowler What?
penny Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s the difference?
penny There’s absolutely no difference.
amy_farrah_fowler How do I get him to treat me better?
penny All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment.
amy_farrah_fowler No, he loves that.
penny Hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
penny All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think I’d be good at that.
penny That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s.
raj_koothrappali Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.
bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
sheldon_cooper That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends.
penny Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
amy_farrah_fowler I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.
penny Ooh, burn!
amy_farrah_fowler And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.
sheldon_cooper Armin who?
amy_farrah_fowler Armin… damn it.
penny Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re hurting me.
penny No, Sheldon hurt you.
amy_farrah_fowler Before; now it’s you.
penny Oh.
sheldon_cooper I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
penny Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. Oh, grow up, Leonard.
raj_koothrappali But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
penny And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler What about the Science Center?
penny I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
amy_farrah_fowler Rain check.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m gonna go, too.
howard_wolowitz I’ll miss you.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll miss you.
howard_wolowitz I’ll miss you more.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, I’ll…
raj_koothrappali Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.
all@ Hear! Hear!
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
debbie_wolowitz Howard Joel Wolowitz! I’ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I’ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!
howard_wolowitz That’s my ride, got to go.
