sheldon_cooper Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.
howard_wolowitz Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
raj_koothrappali Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
penny Hi, you guys ready to order?
howard_wolowitz Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?
leonard_hofstadter And Orcs!
penny I'll be back.
raj_koothrappali Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
penny Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.
howard_wolowitz What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
penny A shower.
howard_wolowitz I'll take the heart smart platter.
penny Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.
penny Well, it's all good.
sheldon_cooper Statistically unlikely.
leonard_hofstadter Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
sheldon_cooper I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.
leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
penny Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
sheldon_cooper Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
penny The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
penny Because you are not at Big Boy!
sheldon_cooper Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
leonard_hofstadter Make it two.
sheldon_cooper Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
leslie_winkle Hey Leonard, hi guys.
leonard_hofstadter Hey Lesley.
leslie_winkle I didn't know you ate here.
sheldon_cooper We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.
leonard_hofstadter Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.
howard_wolowitz And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
penny Howard, I've asked you not to do that.
leonard_hofstadter Lesley and I do research together at the University.
penny Oh, wow, a girl scientist.
leslie_winkle Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I'm glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist.
leonard_hofstadter What happened to Elliot Wong?
leslie_winkle He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure, why not.
leslie_winkle Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
leonard_hofstadter Why at my place?
leslie_winkle Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.
penny Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.
howard_wolowitz If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.
penny Really? I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two.
leonard_hofstadter Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?
sheldon_cooper He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?
penny Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.
raj_koothrappali Oh dear.
howard_wolowitz What's the matter?
raj_koothrappali She didn't take my order.
howard_wolowitz How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.
raj_koothrappali Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.
leonard_hofstadter What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?
sheldon_cooper Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable.
leonard_hofstadter If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.
sheldon_cooper You're a lucky man, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter How so?
sheldon_cooper You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what do you think.
sheldon_cooper I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.
leslie_winkle I admire your fingering.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
leslie_winkle Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.
leslie_winkle Goodnight guys, good job.
male_string_quartettist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 Thanks.
female_string_quartettist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 See you next week.
leonard_hofstadter That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.
leslie_winkle You're welcome. If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure, why not.
leslie_winkle Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
leslie_winkle Yeah, I'm good to go.
leonard_hofstadter I thought you weren't interested in me.
leslie_winkle That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
leonard_hofstadter You mean my cello?
leslie_winkle No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you.
leonard_hofstadter No kidding?
leslie_winkle What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?
leonard_hofstadter Gee, uh ...
leslie_winkle Is it the waitress?
leonard_hofstadter Penny? What about her?
leslie_winkle Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up.
leslie_winkle You and the waitress then?
leonard_hofstadter No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me.
leslie_winkle So, you're open to a sexual relationship?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.
leslie_winkle Good.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?
leslie_winkle Why don't we finish the section first.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
leonard_hofstadter I'm good, I'm good to go.
leslie_winkle Me too.
penny Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?
sheldon_cooper I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
penny I'm sorry?
sheldon_cooper Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols, it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.
penny Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not.
sheldon_cooper Just come with me.
sheldon_cooper Well?
penny Well what?
sheldon_cooper What does it mean?
penny Oh, come on, you went to college.
sheldon_cooper Yes, but I was eleven.
penny Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy.
sheldon_cooper So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
penny Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
leslie_winkle Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.
penny We really shouldn't be standing here.
sheldon_cooper This is very awkward.
penny Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.
penny Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
sheldon_cooper I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide.
penny So, do you know who's in there?
sheldon_cooper Well, there's Leonard. And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster.
penny Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.
sheldon_cooper No, no, wait, hold on.
penny What's the matter?
sheldon_cooper I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
penny Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie.
sheldon_cooper Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.
sheldon_cooper Big boy! Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!
leonard_hofstadter Hey, what's the matter?
sheldon_cooper My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
sheldon_cooper Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chromodynamics, the sign's been changed.
leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
sheldon_cooper Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you ... hey look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
leslie_winkle You're welcome.
sheldon_cooper You did this?
leslie_winkle Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?
sheldon_cooper Cool?
leslie_winkle Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, I'll see you at work.
sheldon_cooper Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!
leslie_winkle What?
sheldon_cooper Who told you you could touch my board?
leslie_winkle No-one.
sheldon_cooper I don't come into your house and touch your board.
leslie_winkle There are no incorrect equations on my board.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that is so ... so ...
leslie_winkle I'm sorry, I've got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. .
sheldon_cooper Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.
leonard_hofstadter You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right.
sheldon_cooper I'm not staring, I'm mulling.
penny Oh, hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
penny So, how's it going?
leonard_hofstadter Pretty good.
penny Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good.
leonard_hofstadter Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?
penny Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper I'm coming.
penny So, is it serious, do you like her?
leonard_hofstadter Wuh, I don't ... th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not ... Sheldon, we have to go!
sheldon_cooper Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.
penny Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
sheldon_cooper Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
leonard_hofstadter You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.
sheldon_cooper She's not that intelligent.
leonard_hofstadter She fixed your equation.
sheldon_cooper She got lucky.
leonard_hofstadter You don't believe in luck.
sheldon_cooper I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
leonard_hofstadter Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.
sheldon_cooper Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper I still don't care.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Lesley.
leslie_winkle Careful Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.
leonard_hofstadter Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
leslie_winkle Because I've got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.
leonard_hofstadter So anyway Hello.
leslie_winkle Uh, what are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
leslie_winkle Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?
leonard_hofstadter I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.
leslie_winkle Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.
leonard_hofstadter Who wouldn't?
leslie_winkle Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?
leslie_winkle Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Okay. Thank you.
leslie_winkle Thank you!
leonard_hofstadter You want to make plans for New Years.
leslie_winkle Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
howard_wolowitz Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!
leonard_hofstadter Doctor what?
howard_wolowitz The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.
leonard_hofstadter Wha ... how did it get on the internet?
howard_wolowitz I put it there.
leonard_hofstadter Well, how did you know about it?
raj_koothrappali A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
leonard_hofstadter Well, that part's true!
sheldon_cooper You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.
leonard_hofstadter No kidding.
sheldon_cooper I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.
leonard_hofstadter Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
sheldon_cooper Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.
leonard_hofstadter Really?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup.
penny So, how's everything.
sheldon_cooper Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.
penny Really, oh yay!
sheldon_cooper Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
penny Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.
penny Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. .
leonard_hofstadter Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
sheldon_cooper You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
leonard_hofstadter Are you even listening to me?
sheldon_cooper Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.
leonard_hofstadter Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. .
