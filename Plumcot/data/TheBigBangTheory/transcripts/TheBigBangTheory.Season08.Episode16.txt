amy_farrah_fowler I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
penny Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
amy_farrah_fowler And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.
amy_farrah_fowler Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.
penny Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?
raj_koothrappali What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.
leonard_hofstadter I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?
penny Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper You didn’t even let me finish.
amy_farrah_fowler Forget it.
sheldon_cooper So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I’m the monster.
raj_koothrappali Why don’t you just do the test?
sheldon_cooper In the interest of science, I’d be willing to.
penny What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Please, can I do it with him? Please?
leonard_hofstadter I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, but what if the experiment works?
penny I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.
sheldon_cooper Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.
leonard_hofstadter In love yet?
sheldon_cooper Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.
penny You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.
sheldon_cooper Okay, babe, let’s do this.
raj_koothrappali You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous.
amy_farrah_fowler Why?
raj_koothrappali Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?
amy_farrah_fowler I think we’re safe.
raj_koothrappali Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.
leonard_hofstadter Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?
amy_farrah_fowler The two of us could do it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure, that might be fun.
amy_farrah_fowler What’s the first question?
raj_koothrappali Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, then I choose a janitor, ’cause I’m about to throw up.
leonard_hofstadter I’m in love. Let’s do something else.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
amy_farrah_fowler Sounds good.
leonard_hofstadter Should we call Howard and Bernadette?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.
amy_farrah_fowler Did he say anything about the funeral?
raj_koothrappali Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?
baggage_clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 No, I’m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.
howard_wolowitz All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 I just need some information. Uh, what’s the flight number?
bernadette_rostenkowski Eight sixteen.
howard_wolowitz I really did mean first.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just drop it.
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 And can you describe the bag?
bernadette_rostenkowski Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.
howard_wolowitz The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
sheldon_cooper You ready to begin?
penny Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.
sheldon_cooper Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
penny What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.
sheldon_cooper Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…
penny Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Living or dead?
penny Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
sheldon_cooper Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.
penny You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.
sheldon_cooper Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?
penny Robert Downey, Jr.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.
raj_koothrappali So, what do you guys want to do?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick.
emily_sweeney Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?
leonard_hofstadter What’s that?
emily_sweeney Um, it’s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.
raj_koothrappali Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.
sheldon_cooper What would constitute a perfect day for you?
penny Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.
sheldon_cooper That’s it?
penny Yeah, why?
sheldon_cooper You didn’t mention Leonard.
penny He’s there.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.
penny Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?
sheldon_cooper Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.
penny Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy.
sheldon_cooper Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?
woman_in_lab_coat#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 You’re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?
leonard_hofstadter Ladies?
emily_sweeney Are you being polite or scared?
leonard_hofstadter Yup.
emily_sweeney Ah, what a room!
amy_farrah_fowler Oh.
leonard_hofstadter This is cool.
amy_farrah_fowler So, how do we start?
emily_sweeney We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.
raj_koothrappali Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?
zombie Uuuuuuuh!
raj_koothrappali Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, where is it?
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 I don’t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?
howard_wolowitz So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight.
howard_wolowitz Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 I’m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.
sheldon_cooper If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
penny Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.
sheldon_cooper I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
penny Come on, I’m just having some fun with you.
sheldon_cooper I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
penny Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.
sheldon_cooper Ha. Keep dreaming.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds.
penny Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.
sheldon_cooper When are we going to get robot eyes?
penny You’re all alike.
sheldon_cooper Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.
penny Really? You always seem so confident.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.
penny Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.
sheldon_cooper You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?
penny And the wave is gone.
zombie Brains!
amy_farrah_fowler Keep it down, we’re working here.
raj_koothrappali Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded.
emily_sweeney How’s it going with the globe?
amy_farrah_fowler We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
leonard_hofstadter I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.
zombie Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!
leonard_hofstadter Yup. Got the code.
zombie Just saying, no refund for finish early!
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.
howard_wolowitz No, I’m not leaving without her.
bernadette_rostenkowski All right, we’ll wait.
howard_wolowitz I could’ve driven her.
bernadette_rostenkowski What?
howard_wolowitz The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 Yes?
bernadette_rostenkowski You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.
leonard_hofstadter Which book are we looking for?
raj_koothrappali Uh, Origin of Species.
leonard_hofstadter Here it is. There’s a black light.
emily_sweeney Oh, hang on.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son.
emily_sweeney Ooh. There’s a picture of the sun over there.
leonard_hofstadter I bet the key’s behind it.
zombie Could be somewhere else.
emily_sweeney Oh, got the key.
amy_farrah_fowler So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?
leonard_hofstadter We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
raj_koothrappali It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.
emily_sweeney Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.
zombie Remember that before you post on Yelp.
penny If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?
sheldon_cooper So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.
penny Today’s your birthday?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.
penny So, why did you finally tell me?
sheldon_cooper The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
penny Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.
sheldon_cooper You’re making it difficult to love you right now.
clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 Great news, your bag was returned.
howard_wolowitz Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, thank you so much.
howard_wolowitz Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.
sheldon_cooper That’s it. We’re done with the questions.
penny All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.
penny You ready?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny And begin. This is kind of creepy.
sheldon_cooper We’re not supposed to talk during this part.
penny Sorry.
sheldon_cooper This is kind of creepy.
penny Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
sheldon_cooper Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.
penny Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.
sheldon_cooper Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.
penny I meant more like a little brother.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.
penny It’s getting creepy again.
sheldon_cooper What?
penny Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
sheldon_cooper It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
penny Can you believe it’s been eight years?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and you’re still eating our food.
penny I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.
sheldon_cooper I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.
penny That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.
sheldon_cooper No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.
penny Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.
sheldon_cooper And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make.
penny Like what?
sheldon_cooper Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?
sheldon_cooper Thank you for walking me home.
penny I just want to make sure you get there safe.
sheldon_cooper Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.
penny It really has.
all@ SURPRISE!
sheldon_cooper Aah! And after I let you be Gary.
