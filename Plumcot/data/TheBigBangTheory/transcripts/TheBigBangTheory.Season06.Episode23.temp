bernadette Burbank Airport, please.
penny Vegas, here we come.
bernadette No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.
amy No rules? We’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?
penny No.
amy So there are some rules.
bernadette Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.
amy Thank you. Vegas!
howard The ladies are away, the boys will play.
raj Anything can happen.
leonard It’s gonna get crazy.
sheldon Dungeons & Dragons.
penny I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.
bernadette I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.
amy I got some old underwear I’m gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
penny I’m sorry, why old?
amy ‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.
sheldon I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.
leonard I’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.
raj I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.
howard Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?
girls Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!
boys The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
raj I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
howard Isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?
raj Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.
howard Ready whenever you guys are.
sheldon Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?
leonard Yeah?
sheldon I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
leonard Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
sheldon Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.
howard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.
leonard See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.
sheldon As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
raj Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya.
leonard Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started.
raj You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.
howard We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says, don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.
sheldon Go on, give him your lunch money.
raj I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
lucy Me, too.
raj Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
lucy Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.
raj Really?
lucy Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why.
raj I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.
lucy Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.
raj What else have you been thinking about doing?
lucy Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs.
raj I like your bangs.
lucy Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too.
raj What else?
lucy Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.
raj Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.
lucy I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53
leonard I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
howard Uh, it does.
sheldon He does sound effects, too!
leonard Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn.
sheldon Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects.
penny Guess who?
howard What are you doing back?
bernadette That’s an excellent question. Amy?
amy Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.
bernadette Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.
amy I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
penny Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.
amy You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.
sheldon Ah, that’s my girl.
leonard No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.
sheldon It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?
leonard What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.
sheldon Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.
penny Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.
leonard So, what do you say?
sheldon I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.
howard A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.
penny Okay, who wants a drink?
sheldon Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.
penny Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you.
leonard Double potion, please.
howard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!
sheldon Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.
howard What do you do?
leonard I draw my broadsword.
sheldon I ready my quarter-staff.
penny I drink my potion.
bernadette I say we attack the big one.
penny You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.
howard The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.
penny Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?
howard Uh, fifteen or higher.
penny Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.
sheldon Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.
penny More potion, please.
leonard Yeah.
raj How are your crab cakes?
lucy Kind of funky.
raj That’s great.
lucy It is? Does funky mean something different in India?
raj No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance.
lucy Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em.
raj Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?
waiter Everything all right?
lucy Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?
waiter Yes.
lucy ‘Kay, thanks, bye.
raj Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
lucy N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country, he doesn’t understand our ways.
raj Don’t be silly. Just tell him.
lucy I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the crab cakes are funky.
waiter So you’re okay here?
raj Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
lucy Uh-oh. Hey, Raj. Funny story.
bernadette Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.
howard Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
sheldon That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
leonard All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out.
amy Okay.
penny Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.
amy Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.
penny No, it’s not.
raj Lucy?
lucy Hey. Long time no see.
raj You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.
lucy I’m sorry.
raj Why would you leave like that?
lucy You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.
raj Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?
lucy Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s scary.
raj Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.
lucy How could you like me a lot?
raj Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.
lucy I’m sweating out of my head.
howard The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.
sheldon Yay!
howard But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.
sheldon Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
howard Fine. You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot.
sheldon The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.
leonard All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.
amy Here we go. Fifteen?
howard It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
sheldon Wait. Wait. And says?
howard Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
sheldon Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.
bernadette This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.
howard Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure.
sheldon Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
amy Sheldon, they’re talking about sex.
sheldon Oh, then I’m out.
penny Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?
bernadette Ooh! Come on, back me up here.
howard Oh.
together Ooh!
bernadette Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
leonard Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.
howard The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?
amy I don’t like this.
sheldon You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
amy What?
sheldon I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
amy You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.
sheldon Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
amy I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
sheldon Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.
amy Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?
sheldon Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.
amy And now?
sheldon And now what?
amy Do you have any interest now?
sheldon I have not ruled it out.
amy Wow. Talk dirty to me.
sheldon I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.
amy I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more.
sheldon More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together.
amy Come on. Let’s go back out there.
sheldon Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through.
amy Okay.
sheldon I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. It comes off.
amy Oh.
sheldon What do you do?
amy I kiss you on the lips.
sheldon I kiss you back on the lips as well. Your turn.
amy I remove your armour. What do you do?
sheldon I erotically caress your nose.
amy Keep rolling.
leonard Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?
sheldon We’re fine, thank you.
penny Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…
amy Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my 14! Yes!
