leonard Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.
howard I got whine.
sheldon I got the B word.
leonard Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.
howard Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.
sheldon If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
leonard Helping women? Y
sheldon Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
leonard Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
sheldon I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
leonard You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
sheldon I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.
leonard You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?
howard Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.
sheldon Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.
leonard Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.
sheldon Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
leonard Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
sheldon I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.
howard Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.
leonard Guys, please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
sheldon We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
howard So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?
sheldon No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point.
leonard Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game
sheldon How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
howard Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
sheldon Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.
leonard Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
sheldon All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
leonard That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?
sheldon Some people are otters, some people are rocks.
leonard I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
howard Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.
leonard That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
sheldon Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.
howard What exactly are you looking up?
sheldon How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
leonard_and_howard No!
raj Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
penny Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
raj Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
amy Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.
raj Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.
bernadette Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you.
penny Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
raj Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.
amy I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.
bernadette Weekends are too crowded.
penny So, blow off work, go on a weekday.
amy Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
penny It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
bernadette Joke?
penny I can laugh about it now.
bernadette So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?
penny I’m in.
amy Me, too.
raj Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
penny Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?
raj I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.
penny Yeah, that’s a toughie.
bernadette Let’s think.
amy Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?
leonard It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
howard Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.
sheldon This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.
howard Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.
leonard And now you’re also an astronaut.
howard So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. Hey.
kid What?
howard Nothing.
sheldon Smart. We don’t want any problems.
amy I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.
bernadette What did you tell your boss?
amy Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.
bernadette Penny, what did you say?
penny I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.
amy So, what are we gonna do first?
bernadette I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.
amy Ooh, that sounds like fun.
penny You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?
amy Come on, do it with us.
penny All right, whatever. How does it work?
bernadette Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.
penny Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
amy Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
penny Yeah.
bernadette We can’t all be Cinderella.
amy Then how do we decide?
bernadette Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.
raj Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.
man In a library?
raj She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.
man People say I’m a little awkward, too. May I join you?
raj No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
man You can do better.
lucy Oh, we’re eating here? We’re having a texting date? I love that.
raj As you’re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.
leonard Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?
howard The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.
girl Did you go to the moon?
howard No, but I did go to the International Space Station.
girl Did you fly the rocket?
howard No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…
girl So you just flew around? That’s kind of like my uncle. He’s a flight attendant.
howard No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?
leonard Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?
girl_2 How did you decide to become a scientist?
leonard Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.
raj My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix.
lucy That’s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.
raj That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know what you do for a living.
lucy Web design.
raj Anything I might have seen?
lucy I don’t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?
raj No, never. What is porn?
lucy Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.
raj Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.
leonard I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?
howard Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.
sheldon Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
amy We’re here.
sheldon Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
amy It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a neuroscientist.
bernadette And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist.
amy The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.
bernadette That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
penny Unless you want to be Cinderella.
bernadette Come at me. See what happens.
raj This was really fun.
lucy My battery’s dying, so I’m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I’ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I’m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that’s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.
raj I’m counting that as foreplay.
howard Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?
bernadette Yes, and I have a surprise for you.
howard Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
bernadette Well, hello, Prince Charming.
howard Milady.
leonard Hey, how was your… what?
penny I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?
leonard Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening.
amy Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.
sheldon Heard you the first time.
