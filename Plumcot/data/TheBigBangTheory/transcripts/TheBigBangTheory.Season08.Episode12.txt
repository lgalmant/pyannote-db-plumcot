sheldon_cooper What colour would you like to be?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it.
sheldon_cooper That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.
leonard_hofstadter Blue and yellow make green.
sheldon_cooper Well, then it’s settled.
penny Hi. Ready to go?
sheldon_cooper Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.
sheldon_cooper Oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.
penny Sweetie, you really thought I’d want to do this?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny Well, did you tell him that?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
penny Did you say it out loud with words?
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.
amy_farrah_fowler I will literally race you to the car.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it.
penny No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted.
sheldon_cooper You want to be green?
leonard_hofstadter You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into.
penny Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I’m banished to the kitchen.
penny Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do.
leonard_hofstadter You got it, you girls are in charge.
penny Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Fine. Now that we’re not playing, you can be green.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper And since you’re green this time, I can be it next time.
penny All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.
amy_farrah_fowler I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.
penny All right, well, what do you want to do?
amy_farrah_fowler There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.
penny Well, that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.
leonard_hofstadter Hang on, why do we have to hate it?
penny Three words, Doctor Who convention.
leonard_hofstadter I did not force you to go to that.
penny You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up.
leonard_hofstadter I wasn’t gonna get beat up.
penny You were, but somehow I held myself back.
sheldon_cooper You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
leonard_hofstadter Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, I’m a problem-solver, it’s what I do.
amy_farrah_fowler I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
penny Is there any part of your body that’s normal?
raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
howard_wolowitz Will you please relax?
raj_koothrappali I can’t take it, dude.
bernadette_rostenkowski You okay?
raj_koothrappali No, I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin.
bernadette_rostenkowski I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back.
raj_koothrappali I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s he talking about?
howard_wolowitz Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.
raj_koothrappali We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
howard_wolowitz Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.
raj_koothrappali Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.
sheldon_cooper Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog.
penny How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
amy_farrah_fowler Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.
sheldon_cooper You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
leonard_hofstadter That’s what I was doing.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?
penny All right, keep thinking.
sheldon_cooper You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Well, then, it’s settled?
amy_farrah_fowler What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.
penny It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.
sheldon_cooper Well, once again, it’s what I do.
raj_koothrappali Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.
howard_wolowitz I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…
raj_koothrappali Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?
howard_wolowitz A story can do two things.
raj_koothrappali Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack.
howard_wolowitz You work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?
bernadette_rostenkowski All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack.
raj_koothrappali I can’t stop thinking about it.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens.
raj_koothrappali I know.
howard_wolowitz Maybe you need to do something more productive.
raj_koothrappali Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
howard_wolowitz So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.
raj_koothrappali Yes.
howard_wolowitz The man who crashed his stationary bike.
raj_koothrappali I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.
howard_wolowitz You happy? Now you can relax.
raj_koothrappali What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
leonard_hofstadter This isn’t so bad.
sheldon_cooper That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties.
amy_farrah_fowler You guys comfy? This might take a while.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
penny No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.
sheldon_cooper They have a man there who understands my personal style.
penny Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.
leonard_hofstadter That’s true.
sheldon_cooper I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s fine.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.
sheldon_cooper Let’s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.
sheldon_cooper Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises.
leonard_hofstadter Look at you, being all mature.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise.
leonard_hofstadter I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?
sheldon_cooper All the time.
leonard_hofstadter On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you.
leonard_hofstadter That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.
leonard_hofstadter What? Then. then why don’t you do it?
sheldon_cooper Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.
raj_koothrappali Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.
howard_wolowitz I’m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?
raj_koothrappali If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple.
howard_wolowitz Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels.
raj_koothrappali I meant a Hindu temple.
howard_wolowitz Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out.
raj_koothrappali Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
howard_wolowitz You love that movie.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s pretty great.
howard_wolowitz I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
raj_koothrappali Why?
howard_wolowitz Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.
raj_koothrappali Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but you’re a scientist.
raj_koothrappali So?
howard_wolowitz So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?
raj_koothrappali That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
howard_wolowitz No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons.
raj_koothrappali Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.
howard_wolowitz Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.
raj_koothrappali Actually there’s no proof of that.
howard_wolowitz You believe in your religion, I’ll believe in mine.
amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going in there?
penny Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?
amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
penny Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?
amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, but it’s okay.
penny How is it okay?
amy_farrah_fowler I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did.
penny Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want.
amy_farrah_fowler Really?
penny Absolutely. You name it, we’re doing it.
amy_farrah_fowler Basket weaving at the craft museum.
penny Well, you named it.
sheldon_cooper Oh, here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast.
leonard_hofstadter Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
sheldon_cooper I wasn’t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.
leonard_hofstadter Because of you, I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak.
sheldon_cooper Well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.
sheldon_cooper Is that true?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.
sheldon_cooper Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.
leonard_hofstadter You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.
sheldon_cooper You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.
leonard_hofstadter Do you mean that?
sheldon_cooper Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, don’t get upset.
sheldon_cooper I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper It’s okay.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.
sheldon_cooper I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy.
penny How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
leonard_hofstadter Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you crazy? You know he’s a flight risk.
sheldon_cooper That’s exactly what I told him.
penny Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready.
sheldon_cooper Well, what if you did it gradually?
leonard_hofstadter All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
sheldon_cooper How about one night and I let you whistle?
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper When I’m not home.
leonard_hofstadter You got it.
sheldon_cooper There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.
howard_wolowitz Here we go, my first Hindu temple.
raj_koothrappali You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.
howard_wolowitz Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.
raj_koothrappali All right. Shall we?
howard_wolowitz Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?
raj_koothrappali Like what?
howard_wolowitz Like am I dressed okay?
raj_koothrappali Really? So every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?
howard_wolowitz I know you’re under a lot of pressure, so I’m gonna let that pass.
raj_koothrappali Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us.
howard_wolowitz That’s nice.
raj_koothrappali Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs.
howard_wolowitz Raj.
raj_koothrappali You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
howard_wolowitz Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It’s fine.
raj_koothrappali Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.
leonard_hofstadter I thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun.
penny Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.
sheldon_cooper It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China.
amy_farrah_fowler Very nice.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it looks great.
sheldon_cooper I saw that.
leonard_hofstadter Well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start.
penny I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m proud of him, too.
sheldon_cooper Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
