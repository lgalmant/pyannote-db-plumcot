penny Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
emily_sweeney Well, Batman’s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.
penny No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.
leonard_hofstadter What is happening?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
raj_koothrappali But it’s beautiful.
penny And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
emily_sweeney Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.
penny Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.
bernadette_rostenkowski We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
penny Oh, I love me some Leo.
leonard_hofstadter And it’s gone.
sheldon_cooper Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.
leonard_hofstadter Good for you.
sheldon_cooper My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.
howard_wolowitz Glad to hear it.
sheldon_cooper I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
raj_koothrappali Yay.
sheldon_cooper Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.
penny You really don’t know why?
sheldon_cooper No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
leonard_hofstadter Let me refresh your memory.
sheldon_cooper Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.
penny Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.
sheldon_cooper Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.
bernadette_rostenkowski I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
sheldon_cooper I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke.
howard_wolowitz Hey, she came all the way here…
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re gonna want to take these with food.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
sheldon_cooper She’s a dermatologist.
emily_sweeney I went to medical school.
sheldon_cooper Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.
leonard_hofstadter All right, here you go.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m dying.
leonard_hofstadter You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.
sheldon_cooper I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.
sheldon_cooper I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Are you feeling any better?
sheldon_cooper Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.
amy_farrah_fowler Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.
sheldon_cooper You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.
sheldon_cooper I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.
sheldon_cooper You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
amy_farrah_fowler No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting.
sheldon_cooper You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Hey. Where’s Sheldon? Still sick?
leonard_hofstadter No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break.
stuart_bloom Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.
howard_wolowitz He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally.
stuart_bloom Oh, I’m on so many antidepressants, I couldn’t if I wanted to.
raj_koothrappali I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
howard_wolowitz You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.
raj_koothrappali Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in.
howard_wolowitz We should all take a trip or something.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.
howard_wolowitz Bernie would love that.
raj_koothrappali Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.
leonard_hofstadter That sounds really fun.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz No.
leonard_hofstadter No.
howard_wolowitz No.
leonard_hofstadter So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.
penny Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay.
penny Well, I’m in. When are we going?
leonard_hofstadter This weekend.
sheldon_cooper Oh, where are we going?
leonard_hofstadter Well, Vegas, but…
sheldon_cooper Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited.
sheldon_cooper Well, now, well, that’s hurtful.
penny Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there.
sheldon_cooper I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
leonard_hofstadter Not this time.
sheldon_cooper Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.
leonard_hofstadter He’s coming, too.
sheldon_cooper Well, then Raj and I will…
leonard_hofstadter Nope.
sheldon_cooper Very well. Stuart.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, great. Do that.
sheldon_cooper Ugh. Stuart.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon. What’s new?
sheldon_cooper Our friends are jerks, and I’m mad at all of them.
amy_farrah_fowler I said what’s new, but sure.
sheldon_cooper Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?
amy_farrah_fowler Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
sheldon_cooper You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
amy_farrah_fowler Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
amy_farrah_fowler Who else’s side could you have been on?
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.
sheldon_cooper Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on.
sheldon_cooper I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.
amy_farrah_fowler Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
sheldon_cooper Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.
amy_farrah_fowler Glad I could help.
sheldon_cooper Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
amy_farrah_fowler I feel so, so bad.
sheldon_cooper Hey, we’re both great at this.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it.
leonard_hofstadter Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance.
sheldon_cooper Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you. I appreciate that.
sheldon_cooper I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
leonard_hofstadter Appreciate that, too.
sheldon_cooper Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?
leonard_hofstadter You’re still not coming.
sheldon_cooper What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come.
sheldon_cooper Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?
leonard_hofstadter Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come.
sheldon_cooper Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.
sheldon_cooper My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?
sheldon_cooper Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.
howard_wolowitz Wow. I’m impressed.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute.
howard_wolowitz Apology accepted.
bernadette_rostenkowski Forgiven, forgiven.
sheldon_cooper All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon Cooper apologized to me
bernadette_rostenkowski And he made it all better.
sheldon_cooper All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.
penny Can this wait?
sheldon_cooper I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
penny Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.
sheldon_cooper Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
penny Leonard.
sheldon_cooper You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.
stuart_bloom Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
sheldon_cooper And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
stuart_bloom What trip to Las Vegas?
sheldon_cooper The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
stuart_bloom Of course, I wasn’t invited.
sheldon_cooper That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?
sheldon_cooper Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.
raj_koothrappali Of course I do.
sheldon_cooper And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.
emily_sweeney Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
sheldon_cooper Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
raj_koothrappali Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
emily_sweeney Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it.
emily_sweeney Why are you defending him?
sheldon_cooper I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
emily_sweeney Well, I don’t accept your apology.
raj_koothrappali What are you doing?
emily_sweeney It’s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.
raj_koothrappali Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop.
emily_sweeney Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.
raj_koothrappali No, come on, please don’t leave.
sheldon_cooper Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…
emily_sweeney Don’t worry, you’re good.
sheldon_cooper I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more.
penny So, was the fight really bad?
sheldon_cooper No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
leonard_hofstadter You think they’ll still go on the trip?
sheldon_cooper All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…
leonard_hofstadter They’re not going on the trip.
penny No.
raj_koothrappali What is wrong with you?
sheldon_cooper Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.
raj_koothrappali You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
sheldon_cooper That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.
all@ No.
penny Is she okay?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.
howard_wolowitz Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option.
sheldon_cooper Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.
raj_koothrappali That’s very mature of you.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.
penny And there’s your next T-shirt.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, check out the stripper pole.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know what that means.
leonard_hofstadter That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
raj_koothrappali You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is so cool.
penny Here’s some champagne.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…
sheldon_cooper Aha.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.
penny You couldn’t give us just one weekend?
stuart_bloom I told him this was a bad idea.
leonard_hofstadter What do we do, kick them off?
penny If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
sheldon_cooper Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.
raj_koothrappali Oh, God.
sheldon_cooper Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
raj_koothrappali You know, Sheldon…
emily_sweeney Shh, let him finish.
sheldon_cooper So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry.
emily_sweeney Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.
emily_sweeney Oh, it’s okay, Sheldon. Come with us.
sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go, Stuart.
stuart_bloom But I want to stay.
sheldon_cooper Stuart, now.
emily_sweeney You know, I know he’s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.
penny And now you see the problem.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, you pain in the ass.
sheldon_cooper That’s me. Bye, Stuart.
stuart_bloom Wait. I’m a pain in the ass, too.
sheldon_cooper Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
emily_sweeney At the moment? No, not really.
penny Shake it, baby.
bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, work that thing.
