leonard_hofstadter Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
leonard_hofstadter One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle.
penny Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food.
penny Why not?
leonard_hofstadter Don’t panic, this is better.
penny Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?
sheldon_cooper Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.
penny Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
leonard_hofstadter We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.
penny Who’s Adam West?
sheldon_cooper Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
howard_wolowitz My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
howard_wolowitz They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
leonard_hofstadter We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
penny There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
leonard_hofstadter No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.
howard_wolowitz Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?
penny That is so sad.
sheldon_cooper No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.
penny Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, bye.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
raj_koothrappali And an Aquaman action figure.
howard_wolowitz Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
raj_koothrappali Huh? That’ll come off.
howard_wolowitz You see what you’re doing? Stop that.
sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
raj_koothrappali It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
sheldon_cooper It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
raj_koothrappali One Ring to find them.
howard_wolowitz One Ring to bring them all.
leonard_hofstadter And in the darkness bind them.
raj_koothrappali Holy crap, are we nerdy.
howard_wolowitz So, I was doing some checking on the ring.
raj_koothrappali Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?
sheldon_cooper Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.
raj_koothrappali No, that’s okay. I’ll get it.
howard_wolowitz Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.
leonard_hofstadter Seedy underbelly?
howard_wolowitz You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.
raj_koothrappali Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
howard_wolowitz Just a guy. I know a guy.
raj_koothrappali Is it Eddie Crispo?
howard_wolowitz No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking.
raj_koothrappali Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
howard_wolowitz I know lots of dangerous people, okay?
raj_koothrappali Name one.
howard_wolowitz Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal.
sheldon_cooper If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.
leonard_hofstadter He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?
howard_wolowitz No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.
sheldon_cooper Mine!
leonard_hofstadter No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
sheldon_cooper Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.
leonard_hofstadter How is this maritime salvage?
sheldon_cooper Other than the lack of water, how is it not?
raj_koothrappali Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?
howard_wolowitz Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…
raj_koothrappali Your guy Eddie Crispo?
howard_wolowitz Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.
raj_koothrappali Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.
howard_wolowitz Why do you want a jet ski?
raj_koothrappali All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
sheldon_cooper We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
howard_wolowitz It’s sad how great that sounds.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.
howard_wolowitz Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
raj_koothrappali There are no Jewish hobbits.
howard_wolowitz Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.
leonard_hofstadter We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?
sheldon_cooper You mean my ring?
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
leonard_hofstadter Give me that.
raj_koothrappali Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.
sheldon_cooper I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
leonard_hofstadter You always get your way.
sheldon_cooper I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
penny Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.
penny What ring?
leonard_hofstadter This ring.
sheldon_cooper Looking for something?
leonard_hofstadter Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
penny Why?
leonard_hofstadter It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it.
penny Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?
howard_wolowitz If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.
leonard_hofstadter How am I looking now?
sheldon_cooper Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
leonard_hofstadter What was that?
penny Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
leonard_hofstadter That’s my girl.
howard_wolowitz So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?
raj_koothrappali Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
leonard_hofstadter No.
raj_koothrappali I was afraid of that. Go ahead.
man_on_screen#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj’s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.
raj_koothrappali Also my cousin.
howard_wolowitz You brought a lawyer?
venkatesh_koothrappali Don’t answer that. I’ll get straight to the point. My client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.
leonard_hofstadter We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
venkatesh_koothrappali Look, we’re big boys, why don’t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.
leonard_hofstadter No Jet Skis.
venkatesh_koothrappali All right, forget the Jet Skis.
raj_koothrappali Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
venkatesh_koothrappali What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.
raj_koothrappali You’re useless.
venkatesh_koothrappali I told you that when you hired me.
raj_koothrappali I’m signing off now.
venkatesh_koothrappali Call your mother, she worries.
howard_wolowitz Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?
sheldon_cooper You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
leonard_hofstadter Give me that.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s mine.
raj_koothrappali It’s all of ours.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
howard_wolowitz Then let go!
leonard_hofstadter I’m not letting go, you let go.
howard_wolowitz I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
leonard_hofstadter Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
raj_koothrappali Sure. Let go of the ring.
leonard_hofstadter All right, it starts now.
howard_wolowitz You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.
raj_koothrappali Wait, my laptop.
howard_wolowitz You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic.
leonard_hofstadter And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
sheldon_cooper I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
leonard_hofstadter You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
raj_koothrappali There are six seasons, dude.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, crap!
raj_koothrappali No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride.
leonard_hofstadter Door.
raj_koothrappali Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.
penny Whatcha doin’?
leonard_hofstadter Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.
penny No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret.
leonard_hofstadter I’m out.
howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.
raj_koothrappali No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!
howard_wolowitz Will you be quiet?
raj_koothrappali Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!
howard_wolowitz I’ll call you back.
raj_koothrappali I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies.
howard_wolowitz Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
raj_koothrappali If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.
sheldon_cooper Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?
raj_koothrappali Why don’t we go after your mother?
sheldon_cooper Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?
howard_wolowitz That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
raj_koothrappali You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
sheldon_cooper No! I call no Meemaws.
raj_koothrappali Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
sheldon_cooper I don’t want to hear this.
howard_wolowitz Then let go of the ring and walk away.
sheldon_cooper Never.
howard_wolowitz All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
sheldon_cooper Stop it!
raj_koothrappali Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.
sheldon_cooper I said stop it!
howard_wolowitz We’re getting to him.
sheldon_cooper Waterfalls!
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
raj_koothrappali It’s, it’s not working, dude.
sheldon_cooper Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee.
raj_koothrappali Then let go of the ring and go.
howard_wolowitz No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too.
raj_koothrappali Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…
sheldon_cooper Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?
howard_wolowitz We stand up.
sheldon_cooper Excellent choice.
raj_koothrappali Three.
howard_wolowitz Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
sheldon_cooper I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine! We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. Where’s the ring?
leonard_hofstadter It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
raj_koothrappali The fires of Mount Doom?
leonard_hofstadter Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
howard_wolowitz You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
leonard_hofstadter I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.
raj_koothrappali Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner.
leonard_hofstadter There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! My precious.
sheldon_cooper I knew it. Give us the precious!
leonard_hofstadter NEVER!
penny Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
