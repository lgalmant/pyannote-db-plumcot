howard Howard Wolowitz.
voice Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.
howard Yes, yes, I’ve been doing my push-ups. I’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me.
roeger That’s great, uh, but that’s not why I called. We’ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission’s been scrubbed.
howard You’re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I’m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I’m not gonna die in space! I’m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.
sheldon I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms.
assistant Okay.
leonard Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
sheldon Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight.
leonard All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
sheldon You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
sheldon Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?
assistant Why don’t you slip this on?
sheldon Said the hangman offering a noose.
raj Well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.
howard Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.
leonard I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going.
howard Why?
leonard Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
howard Yeah, so?
leonard When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?
howard Well, their technology isn’t that bad.
raj When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.
howard All right, well, whatever. I wasn’t worried.
raj You weren’t?
howard Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.
raj Oh, please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.
howard Make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.
sheldon Ah, much better.
leonard You must be burning up.
sheldon A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!
assistant Uh, where’s he going?
leonard He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
sheldon Keys! Keys! Keys!
penny Hey, you.
leonard Before I come in, you should know, I have gas.
penny For the record, not your worst opening line.
leonard Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
penny B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?
leonard Just try it.
penny Okay. What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!
leonard You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch.
penny Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? Leonard, I am your father.
leonard I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
penny Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?
leonard Mm-hmm.
penny Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster.
leonard Oh, great.
penny Mm-hmm.
leonard And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get.
penny You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really great place right now, and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.
leonard So we won’t let it get weird.
penny Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.
leonard What about Cookies!
sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy?
amy Seven o’clock, right on time.
sheldon It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
amy Well, dinner’s almost ready.
sheldon I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date.
amy Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.
sheldon What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
amy With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.
sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?
amy I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.
sheldon Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.
amy I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
sheldon And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school.
amy Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.
sheldon Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.
amy We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?
sheldon Super Mario Bros. theme?
amy Yes.
sheldon I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work.
amy Fine. There’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. Why don’t you have a seat.
sheldon Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.
amy May I offer you something to drink?
sheldon You know I don’t drink.
amy Not even strawberry Quik?
sheldon I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.
amy Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.
sheldon Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
amy Just like your mommy used to make.
sheldon Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.
leonard I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!
penny Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
leonard I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.
penny Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that.
leonard It was the heat of the moment.
penny No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?
leonard I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.
penny Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?
leonard Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.
penny You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?
leonard Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?
penny You’re kidding.
leonard No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
penny It’s not funny.
leonard Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
howard Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?
bernadette You’re kidding.
howard No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.
bernadette Oh, you’re in a good mood.
howard Yeah, well, why wouldn’t I be? You know, I’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. Oh, hang on. Oh, it’s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What’s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that’s great news. Great, great news. All right, I’ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.
bernadette What’s so great?
howard It looks like I’m going into space after all.
bernadette Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!
howard Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.
bernadette What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
howard Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch.
bernadette When?
howard A week from Friday.
bernadette What? We’re getting married that Sunday.
howard You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back.
bernadette Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
howard Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.
bernadette No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get back.
howard But what about all the plans and the guests?
bernadette We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
howard You’re right, he is! Your dad’s gonna be furious. There’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.
bernadette I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his little girl.
howard No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.
bernadette But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight.
howard We can only hope… that he doesn’t.
sheldon Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.
leonard Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?
sheldon I’m fine.
leonard Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?
sheldon Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
leonard We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?
sheldon No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.
leonard Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
sheldon Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies.
leonard I guess we are. So, what’s going on?
sheldon Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.
leonard I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.
sheldon It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.
leonard Shame on her.
sheldon They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.
leonard She’s good.
sheldon I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
leonard You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
sheldon No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?
leonard Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer.
sheldon I assume we’re talking about you now?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?
leonard Pretty much.
sheldon Well, no wonder the women are winning.
howard Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?
mr_rostenkowski I’m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.
howard Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person.
mr_rostenkowski Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it’s a trick question.
howard I’m not sure.
mr_rostenkowski Nah, you’ll never get it. It’s a fraction.
howard How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.
mr_rostenkowski Walnut?
howard No, thank you. I’m allergic.
mr_rostenkowski Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He’s dead now.
howard From nuts?
mr_rostenkowski Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.
howard Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.
mr_rostenkowski Yeah, so?
howard So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.
mr_rostenkowski Where are you going?
howard I’m sorry. May I be excused?
mr_rostenkowski No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?
howard I’m sorry, I didn’t know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I’ll just sit.
mr_rostenkowski When I first met you, I didn’t like you.
howard I’m aware of that, sir.
mr_rostenkowski But then you and I had some time together.
howard Uh-huh.
mr_rostenkowski It did not get better.
howard Right, right.
mr_rostenkowski That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.
howard Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.
mr_rostenkowski No, no, you got to go. You can’t turn down an opportunity like this.
howard But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
mr_rostenkowski You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.
howard Um, okay.
mr_rostenkowski You got a problem with that?
howard All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?
mr_rostenkowski It’s gonna be okay, son.
howard You really think so?
mr_rostenkowski Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she’ll find a new guy.
penny Hey.
leonard Hey. Off to work?
penny Yeah.
leonard Have a nice night.
penny Okay, you, too.
leonard Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
penny Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too.
leonard I noticed you never answered me.
penny You’re right. No.
leonard Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
penny Yep.
leonard Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?
penny Yep.
leonard I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
penny No!
leonard I played that pretty well.
amy Hello, Leonard.
leonard What are you doing?
amy We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style.
sheldon I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop.
