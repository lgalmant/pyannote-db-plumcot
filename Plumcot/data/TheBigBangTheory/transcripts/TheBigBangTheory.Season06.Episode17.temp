raj So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.
girl I have to go to the bathroom.
raj I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I’ve had it checked out, it’s nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. I should have bought condoms.
sheldon Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She’s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.
penny Hello.
sheldon So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.
penny Yeah, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and I just couldn’t join in.
sheldon Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.
penny Uh, I’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?
sheldon What’s wrong?
penny I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It’s something we work on in my acting class.
sheldon Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.
penny Yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them in.
sheldon Right. And which one do I want?
penny Let’s try open.
sheldon If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?
penny Um, well, I’m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?
sheldon Gosh, Penny, what’d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.
howard I’m telling you, something’s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.
bernadette Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?
leonard Don’t look under that rock. Raj, you okay?
howard You in there?
raj Go away!
leonard Come on, buddy, open up.
howard We’re worried about you.
raj Oh, just because I’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.
bernadette Did something good happen?
raj Of course not. Nothing good ever happens.
leonard Whoa.
raj What?
leonard Nope, just, just, whoa.
bernadette It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
leonard Raj, what’s going on?
raj I was humiliated by yet another woman.
howard You didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?
raj No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.
bernadette Oh, you poor baby.
raj I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
howard I’m sorry. That’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.
leonard Yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.
raj Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.
leonard Lobsters overnight?
howard Oh, you’re kidding. Let me see. Well, I’ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.
leonard The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.
bernadette Guys, we’re trying to get him out of here, not you in.
raj You’re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.
howard Now what?
leonard I don’t know.
bernadette We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We’re all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
amy Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello. How’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
amy Fine. Just hold on. Mommy’s on the phone! Sorry. We’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.
sheldon Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.
amy Oh, that’s right. How’d it go with Penny?
sheldon Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.
amy Subtle, but powerful.
sheldon I know. I’m still learning to control it.
amy Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
sheldon Why would I do that?
amy Because she’s your friend, and she did a nice job. I’m sure she’d like to hear it.
sheldon All right.
amy I didn’t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I’d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.
penny Oh, hi. What’s up?
sheldon Um…
penny You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
sheldon No. I didn’t start yet, it’s fine.
penny Okay. So, what do you need?
sheldon Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night Penny. And I just wanted to tell you Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, Penny.
penny Really?
sheldon Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.
penny Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.
sheldon Okay.
penny Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.
sheldon Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?
amy That’s right. They’re no good without the lighter.
sheldon Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.
amy Why? What happened?
sheldon She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don’t worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.
amy Sheldon, that’s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.
sheldon Oh, so many crazy rules.
amy That better be Tootsie Rolls you’re throwing at me!
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny. Oh yeah, much better.
penny What?
sheldon Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I’m obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I’ll go to your dopey play.
penny Hey, I don’t want you to go any more.
sheldon Why not?
penny You should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to.
sheldon Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
penny Okay. Do whatever you want.
sheldon Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?
penny Oh, for God’s sake, just come to the play.
sheldon All right. I don’t want to, but at least that makes sense.
sheldon You know, I haven’t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.
howard He’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again.
sheldon Oh, brilliant. I’ve been itching to pull that trigger.
howard He’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women.
sheldon Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I’m just funnin’ ya.
girl Hi. I don’t know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.
stuart Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.
girl Uh, yeah.
howard You’re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.
girl Sorry. Can you just give him this?
howard Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you’re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
howard Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.
raj I don’t want to celebrate.
howard Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.
raj Why would I want her number? I don’t want anything to do with this woman.
howard Oh, come on, Raj.
raj No, you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.
howard Boy, I want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy.
raj You’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, I’ve made my choice.
howard All right. Well, I’ll see you around.
raj See you. No, wait, take her number. I don’t want the temptation.
howard Okay.
raj I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.
howard All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
raj Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
leonard So, Amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?
amy Sadly, I’m no longer associated with that project.
leonard Why? What happened?
amy Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional.
leonard I’m sorry. That I asked.
sheldon All right, let’s get this stupid play over with.
leonard Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.
sheldon Why?
leonard You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
sheldon Aw, for Pete’s sake. Can we go now?
leonard Well, is that all of it? Just set it down.
amy Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
sheldon It’s about streetcars? Oh, great. I won’t need this.
raj Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.
girl Hi.
raj Uh, would you like to come in?
girl Oh, no, I can’t stay.
raj Oh.
girl I just wanted to say, I’m sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn’t cool. So, uh, yeah. I’m sorry.
raj Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did, or said, or am. ‘Cause those are, like, my buttons.
girl No, it’s not any of that. It’s just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don’t know.
raj Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
girl I’ve been trying to force myself into situations that I’m not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don’t even like comic books.
raj Yeah, me neither.
girl Then what were you doing there?
raj I lied. I love them. I only said that so you’d go out with me.
girl Oh, you don’t want to do that. I’m kind of broken.
raj That’s great. I’m broken, too.
girl Oh, no, you’re not.
raj Oh, I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer, I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.
girl Well, how do I know you’re not just saying that?
raj Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you’ll see.
girl Okay. Text me. Bye.
raj You won’t regret it. I’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it’s done.
penny You love her very much, don’t you?
actor Yes.
penny I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? I understand what that is.
actor To be lonely?
leonard She’s pretty good, huh?
sheldon She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
penny …when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That’s how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
sheldon She’s remarkable.
leonard She really is.
amy Our Penny’s a star.
sheldon How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?
