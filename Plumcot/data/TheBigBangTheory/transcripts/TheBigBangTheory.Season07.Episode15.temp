amy Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.
sheldon I submitted you a notarised list.
amy I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.
sheldon Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please.
amy We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day.
sheldon Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.
amy Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.
sheldon People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.
amy I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
sheldon I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.
amy Come on, Sheldon. Why not?
sheldon For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.
amy One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.
sheldon Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.
amy I got you your own room.
sheldon What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
amy It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
sheldon Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.
amy We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
sheldon Vintage? Be specific.
amy An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
sheldon Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good.
bernadette Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
penny No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
leonard Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs.
penny That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.
sheldon Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?
howard I’m sorry, what?
sheldon Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.
howard I don’t own a pocket watch.
sheldon Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.
raj Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?
penny You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.
raj I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
amy Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic.
raj Except I’ll be alone.
amy I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
leonard We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.
penny Yeah.
raj Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room.
penny Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.
amy What do you think, Sheldon?
sheldon It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
amy I’m so glad you like it.
sheldon I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.
leonard Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?
penny Happy Valentine’s Day.
leonard Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.
penny Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
leonard Got you a little something, too.
penny Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?
leonard It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.
penny Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
leonard Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.
penny Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
leonard Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.
penny Oh, that’s true.
leonard In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.
penny That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
leonard To the bedroom.
penny Yeah.
waiter And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?
sheldon Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
waiter I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food.
sheldon Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
amy Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute.
man_in_seat_behind Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.
sheldon Get out of town.
howard Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train.
leonard Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.
penny No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.
leonard Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
penny We gotta get her to a vet right now.
leonard I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.
penny Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.
leonard Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
sheldon Do another one, do another one.
man Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
man I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.
amy See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
sheldon How many trains have you been on?
man Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
sheldon Wow. Your life’s amazing.
man Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
amy Why do I even try?
bernadette I’m gonna fix this right now.
howard Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
bernadette Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
sheldon You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
man All right.
bernadette Great. Now there’s two of ’em.
lady_vet How much chocolate did she eat?
penny A whole box.
leonard Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.
penny So the point is I may have saved her life.
vet I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?
leonard No. Maybe to her.
vet How big a box of chocolate was it?
penny Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.
leonard Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
penny Do you know how much gas is?
vet Hey.
penny Sorry.
leonard Sorry.
raj Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
vet You’re the owner?
raj Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.
vet Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.
raj Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.
vet Got it. Should have been a dentist.
man Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?
sheldon Trick question. There never was one.
man Or was there?
sheldon What?
man In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.
sheldon In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?
howard A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.
man Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
sheldon I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?
waiter Better than you think.
man You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room.
sheldon I never want this day to end.
amy It’s feeling like it never will.
sheldon Come on.
man Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?
raj As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?
penny It wasn’t cheap. It was free.
leonard We’re really sorry. It was an accident.
penny Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.
leonard Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.
raj Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
vet She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.
raj All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.
vet It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.
raj Thank you.
vet Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
raj Oh, yeah?
vet And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.
penny I think there’s something going on between the two of them.
leonard Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?
howard You okay?
amy Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
howard Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.
amy I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
bernadette Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200
howard I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
bernadette See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.
howard She’s right.
bernadette So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.
howard I had a little to do with it.
bernadette Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?
howard I am.
leonard They’ve been in there, like, half an hour.
penny Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.
leonard How long should we stay?
penny I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.
leonard I saw a Thai place next door.
penny Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
leonard How’s she doing?
penny How is everything?
leonard Yeah.
raj She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
penny Oh, good.
vet So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call.
raj Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
vet My pleasure. Have a nice night.
leonard Yes, thank you for all your help.
penny Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
vet Oh, do you guys own any pets?
penny No.
vet Good.
howard I love you so much.
bernadette I love you, too.
howard Sorry.
bernadette Sorry.
man You guys missed a pretty great time.
sheldon The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.
man It was crazy.
sheldon Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.
amy Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.
howard There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?
bernadette Oh, that sounds so romantic.
amy Oh, give it a rest.
bernadette Let’s go.
amy Why are you still here?
sheldon Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.
amy I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.
sheldon How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
man I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?
sheldon I get it.
amy Leave.
sheldon What is your problem?
amy It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
sheldon Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?
amy Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen.
sheldon Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.
amy That was nice.
sheldon Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.
amy Okay, have fun.
sheldon Do you want to come with me?
amy Really? I do.
man Hey, guys, wait up.
raj There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.
sheldon Hello.
leonard Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?
sheldon It was wonderful.
leonard Great. What did you do?
sheldon I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.
leonard Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.
sheldon Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.
leonard No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?
sheldon Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
leonard Well, give it a go.
sheldon I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
leonard Additional data. You dog.
sheldon I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.
