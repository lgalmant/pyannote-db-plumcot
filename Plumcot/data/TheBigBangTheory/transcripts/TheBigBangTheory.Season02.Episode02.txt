sheldon_cooper Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
leonard_hofstadter Please let it go, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
leonard_hofstadter You’re nitpicking.
sheldon_cooper Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
howard_wolowitz Renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. They’re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
sheldon_cooper Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
howard_wolowitz I don’t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.
penny Hi guys. Looks like you’ve been to the Renaissance fair. I’m hoping.
sheldon_cooper Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
penny Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
howard_wolowitz Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
eric Hey.
leonard_hofstadter So, yeah, good to see you.
penny Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go.
eric Yeah.
penny Bye guys.
eric Like your hat.
howard_wolowitz Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.
leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.
raj_koothrappali By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?
sheldon_cooper That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.
leonard_hofstadter Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
sheldon_cooper You’re wearing modern underwear?
leonard_hofstadter Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
sheldon_cooper I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
leonard_hofstadter You went out and bought linen?
sheldon_cooper Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.
leonard_hofstadter Borrowed?
leonard_hofstadter You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
howard_wolowitz Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
leonard_hofstadter Of course. Out of respect.
howard_wolowitz So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?
raj_koothrappali Who were you respecting then?
leonard_hofstadter What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.
sheldon_cooper Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?
raj_koothrappali Doesn’t count.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
raj_koothrappali What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.
howard_wolowitz You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.
leonard_hofstadter What happened to you?
raj_koothrappali N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
howard_wolowitz It wasn’t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
raj_koothrappali H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.
leonard_hofstadter Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
howard_wolowitz Like who?
leonard_hofstadter Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.
raj_koothrappali What about Leslie Winkle.
sheldon_cooper Oh no.
raj_koothrappali Why?
sheldon_cooper Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.
raj_koothrappali I think she’s smoking hot.
howard_wolowitz I’d hit that.
sheldon_cooper You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
leonard_hofstadter Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.
raj_koothrappali Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
howard_wolowitz You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
raj_koothrappali I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. And he told me his name was Kimberley!
sheldon_cooper You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
leonard_hofstadter How?
sheldon_cooper If we were, the food would be better.
leslie_winkle Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Leslie.
leslie_winkle Hey, dummy.
sheldon_cooper Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.
leslie_winkle Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.
leslie_winkle Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
leonard_hofstadter Where did you hear that?
leslie_winkle Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me.
leonard_hofstadter Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
leslie_winkle I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you’re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
leonard_hofstadter Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
leslie_winkle No, I’m all done with casual sex. From now on I’m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
leonard_hofstadter Really, what changed?
leslie_winkle It’s hard to say, I guess there’s just a time in every woman’s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn’t know.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?
leslie_winkle Anyway, I just figure it’s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?
leslie_winkle Your place, we’ll order Chinese, you’ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.
leonard_hofstadter Sounds fun.
leslie_winkle I’ll leave the details up to you, I think it’s better if you assume the male role.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you, that’s very thoughtful.
leslie_winkle Great. Call me.
sheldon_cooper Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific.
sheldon_cooper You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school.
leonard_hofstadter I kind of have other plans tonight.
sheldon_cooper But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.
leonard_hofstadter Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over.
sheldon_cooper Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
leonard_hofstadter Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?
sheldon_cooper Well, statistically speaking…
leonard_hofstadter Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?
leonard_hofstadter You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
sheldon_cooper You want me to leave the apartment?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.
leonard_hofstadter I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
sheldon_cooper Well alright then.
penny Sheldon? What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
penny Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?
sheldon_cooper I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
penny Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?
sheldon_cooper Alone?
penny Yeah, why not?
sheldon_cooper What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.
penny Well then don’t order popcorn.
sheldon_cooper No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
penny Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.
sheldon_cooper I don’t drink coffee.
penny They have other things.
sheldon_cooper What do they have?
penny I don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…
sheldon_cooper Pastries such as bearclaws?
penny Yeah, sure.
sheldon_cooper I don’t like bearclaws.
leslie_winkle Heya Penny. Dumbass.
sheldon_cooper Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
penny Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists.
sheldon_cooper Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
penny Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.
sheldon_cooper Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you.
leslie_winkle This is pretty good Orange Chicken.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s from Changs.
leslie_winkle Not Chows?
leonard_hofstadter No, Changs.
leslie_winkle What happened to Chows?
leonard_hofstadter It changed.
leslie_winkle Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? I’m sorry, that was a little abrupt.
leonard_hofstadter A little.
leslie_winkle I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.
leonard_hofstadter I sure hope so.
leslie_winkle Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.
leslie_winkle Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there’s the lactose intolerance.
sheldon_cooper Don’t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. What now?
sheldon_cooper I have to make pee-pee.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.
leslie_winkle If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
leslie_winkle Me too. You’re sure you’re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
leonard_hofstadter No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening.
leslie_winkle Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I’m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
leslie_winkle Again, it’s your decision, you’re the man.
penny No, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.
eric From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
penny No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hello.
penny Leslie.
leslie_winkle Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, goodnight.
penny Okay, well, goodnight.
leslie_winkle That ain’t going to make your point. Okay, that’s enough. Call me
leonard_hofstadter Right
penny Okay, goodnight.
eric What?
penny Had a great time, ciao
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.
howard_wolowitz Come on, Sheldon, there’s so few places I can wear my jester costume.
sheldon_cooper I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
sheldon_cooper You mean like Spock?
raj_koothrappali Sure.
sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
leslie_winkle Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.
howard_wolowitz Hmm, let’s do it.
sheldon_cooper If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t make this hard for me.
sheldon_cooper It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
leonard_hofstadter You’re right, it is simple.
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny.
penny Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? Oh. You know, I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something.
sheldon_cooper Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?
penny Goodnight Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?
penny Excuse me?
sheldon_cooper I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
penny Okay, where is this coming from?
sheldon_cooper Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
penny Your arch enemy?
sheldon_cooper Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
penny Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
sheldon_cooper Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.
penny Sheldon, come back, you’re losing me.
sheldon_cooper Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.
penny Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry.
sheldon_cooper She called me dumbass.
penny I know. I heard.
sheldon_cooper Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.
penny Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.
sheldon_cooper No, that response is unacceptable to me.
penny Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…
sheldon_cooper Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
penny Are you going to let me talk?
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry.
penny You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.
sheldon_cooper You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
penny Okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
sheldon_cooper Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
penny Because love trumps hate.
sheldon_cooper Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
penny Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
sheldon_cooper When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.
leonard_hofstadter If the word is pee-pee, just do it.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.
leslie_winkle Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
sheldon_cooper I’m listening, amuse me.
leslie_winkle Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.
sheldon_cooper Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
leslie_winkle Are you going to let him talk to me like that?
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
leslie_winkle No there isn’t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful.
sheldon_cooper I hope so, it was a snort of derision.
leslie_winkle You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.
leslie_winkle Well, I’m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.
leonard_hofstadter Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal.
leslie_winkle Oh, it isn’t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?
leonard_hofstadter I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
leslie_winkle We can’t let them choose, Leonard, they’re children.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, where are you going?
leslie_winkle I’m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker.
sheldon_cooper Look on the bright side.
leonard_hofstadter What’s the bright side?
sheldon_cooper Only nine more months to comic-con.
leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah.
sheldon_cooper Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?
howard_wolowitz Yeah.
sheldon_cooper That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
