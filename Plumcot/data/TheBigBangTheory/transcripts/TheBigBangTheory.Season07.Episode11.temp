penny Wow, you’re really good at this.
amy Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I’m like a pyramid.
penny How you doing over there?
leonard Oh, I hope it’s just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.
penny Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
sheldon Oh, I would, but I’m on my way out.
leonard Where?
sheldon Texas.
amy Right now? Why?
leonard Is someone sick?
sheldon Yes. My sister’s uterus came down with a baby.
penny Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
sheldon No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.
amy How come you never said she was pregnant?
sheldon Well, I never told you about my brother’s kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family’s genitals?
leonard Well, congrats, and it’s nice you’re gonna be there for your sister.
sheldon Yes. I’m filling in for her husband who’s recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.
penny Wow, so, how long will you be gone?
sheldon Well, she’s due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?
amy Can I give you a ride to the airport?
sheldon Oh, no, thank you, I don’t want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.
leonard All right, here’s the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.
penny Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.
leonard And I’m happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
penny Ah.
raj Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?
leonard I know, it’s crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people.
howard I’ve never done this before. It’s kind of fun.
raj Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she’d have a heart attack.
bernadette Good idea, I’ll take a picture.
penny Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.
leonard I love it.
penny Okay.
leonard But it is what you got me last year.
penny Yeah.
leonard And last night.
stuart Hello.
various Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc
stuart Oh, good, I’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it’s, it’s seven, but that’s fine.
amy Oh, it’s probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody’s here, say hi.
penny Hi.
leonard Hey, buddy.
raj Hey.
howard Howdy.
bernadette Hi.
stuart Hello.
sheldon The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me?
amy Yeah, kinda.
sheldon That’s so thoughtful. You guys are the best.
penny Hey, how’s your sister?
sheldon <i>She went into labor an hour ago.
amy That’s wonderful. So you’re at the hospital?
sheldon No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn’t available.
raj You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
sheldon And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‘n Slide.
mrs_cooper Shelly, come on. Your sister’s fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there’s blood everywhere.
sheldon Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.
raj If you were having Sheldon’s baby would you really want him in the room?
penny Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the baby, I’ll give you ten dollars.
bernadette Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.
amy Oh, I love that movie.
raj I’ve never seen it.
stuart Me neither.
amy It’s great. It’s Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart’s really depressed and he’s gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
stuart Don’t need to see it. Living it.
bernadette But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he’d never been born.
penny Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?
leonard What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?
amy You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren’t for him, I don’t think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.
howard Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I’m in this room.
amy It’s true. None of you would know me. You wouldn’t know Bernadette. You wouldn’t be dating Penny.
leonard You don’t know that. I’ve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up.
penny Oh, you weren’t joking.
leonard No.
penny Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.
leonard I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.
howard I’m gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we’re saying things that are never gonna happen.
raj Maybe this time he’s going to do it.
howard Hope you’re thirsty, here it comes.
leonard Watch me.
penny Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?
leonard I, uh, ah, um, I…
penny A few minutes it is.
raj You didn’t ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.
leonard You guys are making me nervous.
howard Fine, then go talk to her on your own.
leonard I will. Excuse me.
penny Yeah?
leonard Hi, uh, um, I’m Leonard?
penny Really? You don’t sound so sure.
leonard No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there’s been something I’ve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.
penny What’s that?
leonard Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, um, uh, if, if you’d be interested in telling me where the restroom is?
penny I think you’re too late.
leonard Come on, I would not have peed my pants.
howard She nailed it.
raj Sounds about right.
leonard But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.
amy Which couldn’t have happened if you didn’t live across the hall from her, which couldn’t have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn’t with Penny, she never would have set you up.
howard Doesn’t matter. Bernadette still would’ve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would’ve been working this beefcake factory. You would’ve been all over me.
bernadette Well…
bernadette Hey, Penny, can I take that table?
penny Sure, why?
bernadette The one in the turtleneck is cute.
raj Open wide, here comes the happy train.
howard Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.
raj Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.
bernadette Never mind.
raj Oh, man, that is so us.
leonard You know, maybe you and I wouldn’t be together, but you wouldn’t have done so great yourself.
penny Why?
leonard Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would’ve ended up with.
zack Hey, babe.
penny Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
zack Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.
penny Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn’t pee himself.
leonard Oh, hold on.
zack Aw, babe, I peed myself.
penny Me, too.
leonard The end.
amy Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
sheldon No, it’s not. I’ve seen things. Lady things.
amy Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
sheldon Doesn’t matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It’s some kind of dirty magic show.
mrs_cooper Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.
sheldon Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I’m the janitor of my sister’s birth canal.
leonard Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there’s pictures. Aah! Don’t open them. Do not open them.
penny Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s like someone sawed a cow in half.
raj My father’s a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I’m gay.
bernadette You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him.
amy And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.
penny We do?
penny Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello.
penny Doing laundry?
sheldon Of course I’m doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I’m in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.
penny Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who’s wearing them.
penny Okay, that’s enough.
leonard Disagree.
raj Keep going.
howard More.
penny So, what do you think?
sheldon A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.
penny Please, Sheldon. I need you.
sheldon To what?
penny To take me.
sheldon I’m not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
penny Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.
sheldon Penny, for the thousandth time, I’m saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud.
penny I think I know how to change your mind.
leonard That’s enough.
raj Ew.
stuart I was okay with it.
amy How’s it going, Sheldon?
sheldon Actually, much better.
leonard Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?
sheldon I don’t know. I just got back.
amy Where’d you go?
sheldon My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. Excuse me, I’m on the phone. So rude.
amy Here’s another one. Penny, if it weren’t for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.
penny Great.
raj At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.
bernadette Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?
leonard We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.
howard I lived with her to save money.
raj Yeah, you didn’t have to buy groceries ’cause you were breast-feeding.
bernadette Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d still be living with her, huh?
howard Not exactly.
penny What do you mean, not exactly?
howard Well, things would be a little different.
mrs_wolowitz Howard, where’s my lunch? I’m starving.
howard I know you’re starving. The neighbours know you’re starving. There’s starving people in Africa who know you’re starving.
mrs_wolowitz That’s it? There’s not enough food.
bernadette How is this any different?
howard You didn’t let me finish. Here you go, Mother.
dead_mrs_wolowitz You’re a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.
amy Wait, did she die or did you kill her?
howard Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she’s dead.
bernadette Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?
leonard Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies’ man.
raj Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.
raj Come on, Leonard, dinner.
fat_leonard Coming.
leonard Hang on. Why would I be fat?
raj You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.
leonard Why can’t you be fat, too?
fat_leonard What do you want to do for dessert?
fat_raj I think there’s still half a cake from breakfast.
fat_leonard No, there’s not.
fat_stuart Hey, guys.
fat_leonard_and_raj Stuart!
raj What are you doing?
stuart I just wanted to be in anyone’s story.
raj Yeah, but why are you fat?
stuart ‘Cause Leonard was fat.
penny Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be doing if you never met Sheldon?
amy It’s hard to say, my life would be so different.
howard You can say better. Sheldon can’t hear you.
amy I don’t know.
amy Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there’s tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me.
stuart I’ll stop now.
amy How’s it going, Sheldon?
sheldon That’s it. The baby’s here. It’s a boy.
penny Aw.
amy Yay.
raj Congrats.
sheldon Oh, thank you. I wasn’t sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.
leonard Well, good for you, buddy. We’ll let you get back in there.
sheldon Oh no, no, I’m not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.
howard Aw, he’s already taking after Uncle Shelly.
amy Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
sheldon Why?
amy Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.
sheldon Ugh, all right, I’ll go. But from what I’ve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.
bernadette You actually got him to do it.
rajj Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you’ve clearly had an impact on him.
amy If that were true, I wouldn’t still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon’s T-shirts on it.
leonard I’m telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.
amy I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn’t a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.
leonard Hang on, I’m gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I’m gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he’d probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that’s fine. Look.
amy I don’t understand.
leonard He made you his screensaver.
amy Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where’d I go?
leonard Oh, well, it’s you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you’re in the mix.
amy I am in the mix. And I’m the hottest one.
penny Who’s that?
leonard Oh, Madame Curie.
amy That’s fine, she’s dead.
sheldon You okay?
amy Just really glad you’re back.
sheldon Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.
amy I missed you.
sheldon To quote Han Solo, I know.
amy Did you miss me?
sheldon I would’ve preferred to have you there with me.
amy Oh.
sheldon Or instead of me.
amy Did you hold the baby?
sheldon I did.
amy And? How did it make you feel?
sheldon Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn’t begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.
fat_leonard I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna ask her out.
howard And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
fat_raj Put up or shut up. You make it, I’ll drink it.
penny You guys need anything else?
fat_leonard Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.
penny I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?
stuart Not until I get my kiss.
