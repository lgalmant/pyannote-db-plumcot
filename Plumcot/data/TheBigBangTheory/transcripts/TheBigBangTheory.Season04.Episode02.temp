leonard Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
sheldon The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
leonard Yes.
sheldon And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
leonard Yes.
sheldon What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
leonard A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
sheldon My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.
leonard Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
sheldon Killed by badger.
leonard How’s that?
sheldon It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
leonard I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
sheldon Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?
leonard You can always get a badger and find out.
sheldon But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.
leonard That long, huh?
sheldon 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
leonard What’s there?
sheldon The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.
leonard So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
sheldon By this much.
leonard Tough break. You want eggs?
sheldon You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory cold fusion, the dogapus.
leonard What’s a dogapus?
sheldon A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
leonard Is somebody working on that?
sheldon I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
leonard Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
sheldon A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
howard What do we owe you?
leonard It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
howard Here you go.
leonard Thank you.
penny What?
leonard Never mind. I got it.
penny Oh, you wanted me to pay.
leonard It’s no big deal.
penny No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. What?
howard He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life.
penny Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.
leonard Hmm? How much you got?
penny Nothing.
leonard How can you walk around with no money?
penny I’m cute. I get by.
leonard It’s okay, you can owe me.
penny Okay.
leonard Sheldon, six bucks.
sheldon No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.
penny But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.
sheldon Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.
howard Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?
sheldon It’s a small price to pay.
penny For what?
leonard No, no, don’t ask.
penny Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
sheldon In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.
penny Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
sheldon Correct.
penny So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
sheldon Essentially, yes.
penny Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?
sheldon Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.
penny Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
sheldon Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
howard You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.
sheldon That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.
penny No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?
howard Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.
penny Oh, my God, that is so creepy!
howard I know! And he says he’s not gonna stop. Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
sheldon Ugh. U-u-ugh. Lenu-u-ugh.
leonard What the hell? What’s the matter?
sheldon I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
leonard There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
sheldon Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
leonard When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
sheldon It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!
leonard Have you had your appendix out?
sheldon I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?
leonard Let’s get you to the hospital.
sheldon So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?
leonard No.
sheldon I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
leonard Funny how things work out, isn’t it?
sheldon Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
leonard Good night.
sheldon Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.
sheldon Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
penny Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?
sheldon No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?
penny I don’t have one.
sheldon What about your pedometer?
penny Don’t have one.
sheldon Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
penny Uh, no.
sheldon What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
penny No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.
sheldon Why are you doing that?
penny It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
sheldon All right.
penny All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.
sheldon I am doing it.
penny Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?
sheldon We’ll never know.
penny Okay, let’s just warm up on the run.
sheldon Okay.
penny Okay, let’s go.
sheldon Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
penny Oh, my God, are you okay?
sheldon I think so.
penny Oh, let me help you up.
sheldon Thank you.
penny Oh, Sheldon!
sheldon If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
leonard Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.
howard Thank you, sir.
leonard Palak paneer, that’s Penny.
penny Thanks.
leonard And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
penny Hey, what’s my share?
leonard Uh, 12 bucks.
penny Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?
leonard Sure.
penny What am I up to now?
leonard Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
penny What now?
howard He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
penny It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back. Shut up!
leonard Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
sheldon Coming! . Greetings, friends.
leonard Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
sheldonbot I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.
howard Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?
sheldonbot You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.
penny Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.
sheldonbot Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.
leonard This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
sheldonbot You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.
leonard You’re in your bedroom.
sheldonbot No, I’m not.
leonard I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
sheldonbot No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!
penny So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
leonard Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
sheldon I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
leonard I am looking at you.
sheldon No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
leonard You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
sheldon At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?
leonard At the hands of your roommate?
sheldon An accident.
leonard That’s how I’m going to make it look.
sheldon Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.
leonard Fine, but don’t expect my help.
sheldon You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.
leonard No, it’s not.
sheldon Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
leonard I’ll be damned.
sheldonbot This is delightful.
leonard Uh-huh.
sheldonbot It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
leonard Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
sheldonbot Because I called shotgun. Remember?
leonard Right.
sheldonbot You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
leonard I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.
sheldonbot Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.
leonard Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.
sheldonbot You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?
leonard I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.
sheldonbot Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
leonard No.
sheldonbot This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.
leonard That’s it. Bye-bye.
sheldonbot Bazinga.
leonard Whoa!
sheldonbot I have an override switch.
leonard I almost died!
sheldonbot And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?
leonard I’m still going to go with you.
sheldonbot Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.
leonard What about it?
sheldonbot Be a lamb and open it for me.
leonard Why? What’s the problem?
sheldonbot You think you have me stymied, don’t you?
leonard No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.
howard Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.
raj That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
sheldonbot Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.
raj Oh, sure.
sheldonbot He’s a lamb. You’re not.
raj I’m a lamb.
sheldonbot Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
howard I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
raj That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes.
penny Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.
leonard Why are you introducing yourself?
penny I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
sheldonbot Can you tell me the specials this evening?
penny Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you.
sheldonbot Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.
penny Because you’re not here.
sheldonbot That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.
howard Is that Steve Wozniak?
leonard I think it is.
sheldonbot The Great and Powerful Woz.
leonard Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
penny Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.
sheldonbot I must speak to him.
leonard Of course you must.
penny You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
sheldonbot Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
steve_wozniak Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.
sheldonbot Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
steve_wozniak Only fifteenth?
sheldonbot It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
steve_wozniak Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.
sheldonbot One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.
steve_wozniak Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I’d autograph it for you.
sheldonbot Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
steve_wozniak Nerds.
sheldon I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. Ow! Aw.
sheldonbot Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What up, Shel-Bot?
sheldonbot I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
penny What do you want me to do?
sheldonbot Sing me Soft Kitty.
penny Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
sheldonbot Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.
sheldonbot Closer to the microphone.
penny Happy kitty, sleepy…
sheldonbot No. You have to start over.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
