penny Helium.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper Taylor Swift.
penny Yes. Pi.
sheldon_cooper Yes. Kardashian.
penny More specific.
sheldon_cooper Khloe?
penny Yes.
sheldon_cooper See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.
penny Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?
leonard_hofstadter What are you guys doing?
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, let me try.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?
penny Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
penny No problem.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?
sheldon_cooper Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
leonard_hofstadter Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.
sheldon_cooper She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
penny You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
leonard_hofstadter Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.
penny Or a way for you to avoid her?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.
penny Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously?
penny Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship.
leonard_hofstadter That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
sheldon_cooper All right, back to learning.
penny Okay.
sheldon_cooper Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.
penny Or as I know him?
sheldon_cooper Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
penny Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
raj_koothrappali Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.
leonard_hofstadter When’s the screening?
raj_koothrappali Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
howard_wolowitz Let’s do it.
leonard_hofstadter Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in.
sheldon_cooper Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.
leonard_hofstadter You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
howard_wolowitz In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?
raj_koothrappali Uh, I’d say by three.
sheldon_cooper You’re really going without me?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you.
sheldon_cooper You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting.
leonard_hofstadter People do it all the time.
sheldon_cooper You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
howard_wolowitz If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.
stuart_bloom People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.
howard_wolowitz Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
stuart_bloom And now I feel worse again.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He’s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?
penny Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Dear, I’m a psychiatrist. You don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.
penny Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Very well. What’s the last book you read?
penny Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Penny, it’s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?
penny Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?
dr_beverly_hofstadter And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?
penny Uncomfortable.
dr_beverly_hofstadter That was a joke, dear.
penny Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
dr_beverly_hofstadter So just the two of us?
penny Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.
stuart_bloom Hey.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon.
stuart_bloom I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.
amy_farrah_fowler Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?
stuart_bloom No, it’s not like that. There’s a long line he’d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.
amy_farrah_fowler We’re not going shopping together.
stuart_bloom You sure? I’m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.
amy_farrah_fowler Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?
stuart_bloom Look, lady, I just work here.
howard_wolowitz We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?
sheldon_cooper Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
leonard_hofstadter Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
sheldon_cooper Stuart, what are you doing here?
stuart_bloom Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?
stuart_bloom Oh, I’m not upset with you, but Amy’s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.
stuart_bloom You’re darn right it’s fair play, you selfish jerk.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, it’s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.
amy_farrah_fowler I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, I do admire your resolve. You’re an extraordinary woman.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
penny You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?
bernadette_rostenkowski Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.
amy_farrah_fowler Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.
penny You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Yes. Well, what can you do?
amy_farrah_fowler Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry.
stuart_bloom Sheldon says he’s sorry.
amy_farrah_fowler Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door.
stuart_bloom I would have done it for three.
raj_koothrappali Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.
howard_wolowitz Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
raj_koothrappali Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.
stuart_bloom Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
stuart_bloom Uh, no, she’s still pretty mad.
sheldon_cooper Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
stuart_bloom I said, Sheldon says he’s sorry.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick.
leonard_hofstadter You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
sheldon_cooper I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot.
stuart_bloom I’m happy to hold your place till you get back.
sheldon_cooper You would do that?
stuart_bloom Consider it my way of getting more of your money.
sheldon_cooper You’re a good man.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I didn’t realize you two work together.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, what are you currently developing?
bernadette_rostenkowski Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
dr_beverly_hofstadter That’s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.
dr_beverly_hofstadter It was.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?
penny Um, it has seat warmers.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy.
amy_farrah_fowler Come in.
sheldon_cooper Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.
amy_farrah_fowler Fine.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.
penny How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Since the airport, dear.
howard_wolowitz You look like you come with a kickstand.
raj_koothrappali You can’t make me feel bad.
howard_wolowitz Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
sheldon_cooper I’m back.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’d it go?
sheldon_cooper It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.
stuart_bloom Anyone else need anything before I go?
howard_wolowitz I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.
stuart_bloom That’s mean.
howard_wolowitz Five.
stuart_bloom You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.
howard_wolowitz Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 Hey, guys.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 You made it.
sheldon_cooper Did you see that? He just cut the line.
leonard_hofstadter He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.
howard_wolowitz We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.
sheldon_cooper What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
leonard_hofstadter We’d still get in.
sheldon_cooper What if each of those people let someone cut?
leonard_hofstadter Still get in.
sheldon_cooper But then each of those people let someone cut?
leonard_hofstadter We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, please don’t.
sheldon_cooper Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 Oh, uh, I’m with my friends. It’s cool.
sheldon_cooper Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper You need to go to the back of the line.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 Uh, who made you line monitor?
sheldon_cooper Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 Is this guy for real?
leonard_hofstadter Boy, I wish I could say no.
dr_beverly_hofstadter That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Your relationship with him is fascinating. I’m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?
bernadette_rostenkowski Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Wonderful. I’ll give you my contact information.
bernadette_rostenkowski Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.
dr_beverly_hofstadter About what?
penny Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?
penny What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face.
dr_beverly_hofstadter My intention was never to insult you.
penny You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, it’s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.
penny Okay, good example.
sheldon_cooper What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
sheldon_cooper They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.
raj_koothrappali He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 Told you.
sheldon_cooper Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you.
howard_wolowitz I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair.
sheldon_cooper You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.
sheldon_cooper Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.
sheldon_cooper I most certainly did not.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 I saw you.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 If you’re feeling dizzy, it’s because the tables have turned.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in.
leonard_hofstadter Buddy, let it go.
sheldon_cooper No, I can’t. This isn’t right.
leonard_hofstadter You did everything you could.
sheldon_cooper No, I could’ve done more.
leonard_hofstadter Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.
penny To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore.
amy_farrah_fowler I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us.
penny It was spur of the moment.
bernadette_rostenkowski But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I could’ve watched it on the Internet?
penny Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?
dr_beverly_hofstadter No, I would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would’ve been nice.
penny You really think we made a mistake?
dr_beverly_hofstadter At the time I did. But I’ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.
penny Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I would find that perfectly acceptable.
penny She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.
howard_wolowitz I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.
