leonard_hofstadter Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
howard_wolowitz Yes, actual women are the best.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
leonard_hofstadter Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?
howard_wolowitz No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.
leonard_hofstadter What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
howard_wolowitz There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
raj_koothrappali Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
leonard_hofstadter Got it.
howard_wolowitz Seen it.
sheldon_cooper Detailed analysis posted online.
raj_koothrappali Well, then what are we going to do tonight?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.
leonard_hofstadter How did we get actual women?
raj_koothrappali Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?
sheldon_cooper It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
raj_koothrappali We do?
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to do that.
sheldon_cooper All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
raj_koothrappali What about me?
sheldon_cooper Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.
raj_koothrappali Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.
raj_koothrappali Race riots?
sheldon_cooper The zoot suit riots.
raj_koothrappali Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?
sheldon_cooper I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
raj_koothrappali No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
sheldon_cooper That’s a semantically null sentence.
raj_koothrappali Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.
raj_koothrappali Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.
sheldon_cooper If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
sheldon_cooper Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.
raj_koothrappali Oh, boy.
sheldon_cooper One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.
raj_koothrappali I don’t want to go to Flatland.
sheldon_cooper You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
raj_koothrappali Oy.
sheldon_cooper Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone.
sheldon_cooper Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.
raj_koothrappali What?
sheldon_cooper Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
leonard_hofstadter I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.
howard_wolowitz Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?
penny That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?
howard_wolowitz Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.
bernadette_rostenkowski How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?
penny Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
leonard_hofstadter Great. How come?
penny Well, promise you won’t make fun of me.
leonard_hofstadter Of course, I would never make fun of you.
penny Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?
howard_wolowitz Good job not making fun of her.
penny She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site.
penny Why are you being such a jerk?
leonard_hofstadter You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
penny Ha-ha, bite me.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Penny.
howard_wolowitz Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sliding into third.
raj_koothrappali Thanks for coming with me.
sheldon_cooper Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
raj_koothrappali Did you really have to bring it in with you?
sheldon_cooper What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
raj_koothrappali Come on, let’s get a drink.
sheldon_cooper I don’t drink.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.
sheldon_cooper I would like a root beer float.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream.
sheldon_cooper They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.
raj_koothrappali He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
sheldon_cooper And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
raj_koothrappali Okay, let’s check out the females.
sheldon_cooper All right. There’s a female.
raj_koothrappali That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old.
sheldon_cooper But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
raj_koothrappali No. I’m looking for a hookup.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
raj_koothrappali Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
raj_koothrappali You help me run my game.
sheldon_cooper Okay. What is your game?
sheldon_cooper When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 Hey, that’s pretty cool. What is it?
sheldon_cooper It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 You’re very funny. I’m Abby.
sheldon_cooper I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
raj_koothrappali How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
abby Hi, Raj. Where are you from?
raj_koothrappali The mysterious subcontinent of India.
abby Ooh, India.
raj_koothrappali You know India?
abby I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
raj_koothrappali Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.
sheldon_cooper I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry.
abby Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.
martha Hi.
raj_koothrappali Hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
martha Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
sheldon_cooper In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
martha Oh, that is so awesome.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
bernadette_rostenkowski So, what should we talk about?
howard_wolowitz Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?
penny Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, but facts are facts.
penny Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact.
leonard_hofstadter No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact.
penny Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
penny Amazing. Would you like to try some?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
penny Well, the fact is, you can’t.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here.
howard_wolowitz What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
bernadette_rostenkowski No, thank you.
howard_wolowitz Sorry.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
penny Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
waiter How is everything tonight?
bernadette_rostenkowski Really uncomfortable.
leonard_hofstadter You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… Want your fish? I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse.
leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
sheldon_cooper We scored. I’m the wingman.
howard_wolowitz Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Laser.
howard_wolowitz Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell is eighth base?
howard_wolowitz Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, couldn’t be better.
howard_wolowitz Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
leonard_hofstadter It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
howard_wolowitz All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon.
leonard_hofstadter How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
howard_wolowitz Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.
leonard_hofstadter And that didn’t bother you?
howard_wolowitz Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
leonard_hofstadter What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?
howard_wolowitz Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you.
leonard_hofstadter Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.
howard_wolowitz Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the
leonard_hofstadter What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard.
howard_wolowitz I respect that.
leonard_hofstadter What is that?
howard_wolowitz Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
sheldon_cooper The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. One minute.Sis.
raj_koothrappali What was that?
sheldon_cooper It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish.
raj_koothrappali जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
sheldon_cooper I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
raj_koothrappali I don’t get it. You had a great time.
sheldon_cooper Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again.
raj_koothrappali Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha.
sheldon_cooper Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
raj_koothrappali My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
sheldon_cooper Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years.
raj_koothrappali So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
sheldon_cooper Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
raj_koothrappali You can’t wear the hands on the date.
sheldon_cooper Hulk sad.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.
penny Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
leonard_hofstadter No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.
penny Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
leonard_hofstadter Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
penny I would not.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s go see your psychic.
penny Really?
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.
penny You saying I don’t have an open mind?
leonard_hofstadter No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.
penny You know, I believe in ghosts, too.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
penny And astrology.
leonard_hofstadter I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.
penny Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work.
leonard_hofstadter Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
penny Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo.
martha Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.
sheldon_cooper You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late.
martha Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper Time for bed.
martha Okay.
sheldon_cooper Good night, puny human! .
martha Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yes?
martha Listen, they’re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night.
