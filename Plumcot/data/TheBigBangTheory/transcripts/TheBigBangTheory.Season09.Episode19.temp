amy I didn’t understand your e-mail.
sheldon Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.
amy I didn’t understand your e-mail.
sheldon Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.
amy Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?
sheldon So, is that a yes?
amy Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date.
sheldon Oh, but I like this computer.
amy The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
sheldon I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.
amy The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
sheldon The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.
amy Get a new computer.
sheldon What?
amy Get a new computer.
sheldon What? Hello?
leonard This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?
howard Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.
leonard If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set.
penny Hey, guys.
leonard Hey. What are you doing here?
bernadette We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
penny Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.
leonard Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.
penny So, how’s it goin’?
leonard Good. Slow.
howard There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.
penny Is there anything we can do to help?
leonard You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.
penny Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
bernadette Can we really help?
howard While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.
leonard I’ll show you how to do one.
penny Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.
amy I got here as quickly as I could.
sheldon You’re too late.
amy Sheldon, this is silly.
sheldon You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
amy That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
sheldon Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
amy Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.
sheldon How could you do that?
amy Do what?
sheldon Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?
amy Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.
sheldon Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?
amy Yes.
sheldon Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
amy Yes.
sheldon Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?
amy Yes.
sheldon Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.
leonard After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.
penny Like this?
leonard Yeah, perfect.
penny Oh.
leonard And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.
howard I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
leonard We had a full spool yesterday.
howard What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.
bernadette Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial.
leonard Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.
penny How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
leonard Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…
penny Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.
howard You want to come with us?
bernadette I’m kind of getting into the groove here.
penny Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.
leonard Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.
penny Okay, so what is solder?
sheldon I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?
amy Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
sheldon You wouldn’t.
amy Whatch me.
sheldon Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.
amy I thought you might like it.
sheldon Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs.
amy Or you could just look into my eyes.
sheldon But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
amy Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.
sheldon Oh. I am.
amy And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
sheldon Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.
amy Oh, but he said you can get store credit.
sheldon Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit.
amy But why wouldn’t…
sheldon Can we please change the subject?
amy Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?
sheldon I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.
amy Sheldon, just tell me.
sheldon It might be easier to show you.
amy Okay.
sheldon We’d have to take your car.
amy All right.
sheldon And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
amy Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?
leonard Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
howard Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
leonard I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
man Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?
leonard Oh. Sorry, we can’t.
howard Well, hang on. What movie is it?
man Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.
howard Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.
leonard What about the girls?
howard Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?
leonard Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.
penny I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.
bernadette It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.
raj Hey. Where are the guys?
penny Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.
bernadette Since when do you work on weekends?
raj I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.
penny You were home alone and had no one to play with?
raj Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?
bernadette Not with Lightning McQueen here.
penny I think we’re good.
raj Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.
bernadette I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
raj Yes.
amy Will you please tell me where we’re going?
sheldon Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis.
amy I’m driving the car. I need to know.
sheldon Right.
amy So where are we going?
sheldon No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.
leonard What are we gonna tell the girls?
howard It’s not a problem.
leonard I mean without lying.
howard And now you’ve made it a problem.
leonard Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
penny Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.
leonard They bought it.
howard But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
leonard Oh, you’re good at this.
howard Well, I lie a lot.
man Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.
leonard Hey, you were right.
howard Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.
man Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.
leonard Who are you texting?
howard Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
leonard He’ll never make it in time.
howard I know. I want to make him feel bad.
leonard Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend.
raj Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
penny Why?
raj I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
bernadette What’s going on?
raj Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
penny Un-freakin’ believable.
bernadette Son of a bitch.
raj Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.
penny No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
bernadette Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.
penny Mm-hmm.
raj Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.
amy Why do you have a storage unit?
sheldon Just wait.
amy How long have you had it?
sheldon Just wait.
amy Do you want me to hold that computer?
sheldon Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.
amy I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?
sheldon It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.
amy All of it?
sheldon I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
amy Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.
penny All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?
raj I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
penny Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?
raj No, ma’am.
bernadette Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.
penny Yeah, that’s pretty good.
raj I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.
sheldon In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.
amy You have sporting equipment?
sheldon Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.
amy Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?
sheldon I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.
amy So, why do you feel you need to save these things?
sheldon I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…
amy Okay. I get it. I get it.
sheldon It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.
amy I don’t.
sheldon Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.
amy Why?
sheldon Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?
amy It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.
sheldon Like what?
amy Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?
sheldon I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
amy It’s not a contest.
penny Okay, here they come.
bernadette Go hide.
raj Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.
leonard Hey.
howard Hi.
penny Hey, what’s this?
leonard Listen, we did a stupid thing.
howard We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.
leonard So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner.
howard Yeah. Anywhere you want.
bernadette Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.
penny Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.
raj Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them.
howard What is he doing in there?
raj Busting you.
bernadette It’s okay. They apologized.
penny Yeah, it’s fine.
raj Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
howard You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
raj No spoilers. No spoilers.
penny And he’s back in the closet.
howard Ready for dinner?
penny Yeah.
bernadette Should we invite Raj?
raj Yes.
amy So, no one else knows about this?
sheldon Only you.
amy Thank you for trusting me.
sheldon What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
amy That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you.
sheldon Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.
amy Baby steps, I guess.
sheldon I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
amy Oh. Okay.
sheldon I will always have the dent to remember it by.
amy You did it. Do you feel okay?
sheldon Actually, yes. I do.
amy Well, I’m proud of you.
sheldon Thanks.
sheldon I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.
amy Well, I feel closer to you now.
sheldon Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.
amy What did you have in mind?
sheldon You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.
amy I really had to go home for this?
sheldon Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room.
amy And yet, I’m not.
sheldon But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
amy And yet, you can’t.
sheldon I know.
