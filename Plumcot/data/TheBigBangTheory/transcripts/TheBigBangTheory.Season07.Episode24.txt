leonard_hofstadter How’s your mom holding up?
howard_wolowitz She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.
amy_farrah_fowler How many is that now?
howard_wolowitz Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.
bernadette_rostenkowski She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.
sheldon_cooper So, who’s watching her now?
howard_wolowitz A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.
raj_koothrappali What up, guys?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello, hey!
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.
raj_koothrappali And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, hey, what the hell?
bernadette_rostenkowski You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
penny You’re right! Yay!
raj_koothrappali Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?
howard_wolowitz Because you had sex the other night?
raj_koothrappali You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter You okay?
sheldon_cooper I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
howard_wolowitz Why?
sheldon_cooper He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face.
leonard_hofstadter That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.
sheldon_cooper It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university.
howard_wolowitz You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.
leonard_hofstadter Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I am really aggravated.
raj_koothrappali When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.
howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, give her a chance.
nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 No. Life, it is too short.
bernadette_rostenkowski I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea.
bernadette_rostenkowski That’s not helpful.
howard_wolowitz Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.
bernadette_rostenkowski But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
howard_wolowitz Well, what if we use our vacation time?
bernadette_rostenkowski I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
howard_wolowitz I don’t know what else we can do.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.
dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m listening.
leonard_hofstadter Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?
dr_beverly_hofstadter No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.
leonard_hofstadter I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Would you like for you and me to talk more?
leonard_hofstadter You know what? It’s probably fine.
dr_beverly_hofstadter In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.
leonard_hofstadter I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
dr_beverly_hofstadter Sure.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks, Mom.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, it would.
dr_beverly_hofstadter Yeah. Well, you should work on that.
penny No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.
amy_farrah_fowler Atomic magnets?
penny Shut up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.
penny You want some wine?
bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.
penny I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
bernadette_rostenkowski It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.
amy_farrah_fowler So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?
penny Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?
penny Not a chance.
bernadette_rostenkowski Please. I’m desperate.
penny No.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll pay you anything you want.
penny Okay, then, yeah.
penny No, keep your money.
bernadette_rostenkowski I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
leonard_hofstadter What you working on?
sheldon_cooper I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. How’s it going?
sheldon_cooper You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.
leonard_hofstadter It’s nice that you called them esteemed.
sheldon_cooper You’re right. I’ll take that out.
leonard_hofstadter So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.
sheldon_cooper Mm.
leonard_hofstadter Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.
sheldon_cooper Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not.
sheldon_cooper Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.
leonard_hofstadter Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.
sheldon_cooper What do you mean?
leonard_hofstadter Well, well, we might want to live together.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.
leonard_hofstadter That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
sheldon_cooper I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?
leonard_hofstadter Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.
sheldon_cooper Where are you going to go?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.
sheldon_cooper Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
leonard_hofstadter No, I did not.
sheldon_cooper Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?
leonard_hofstadter Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
sheldon_cooper I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah.
sheldon_cooper Wow.
sheldon_cooper How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
amy_farrah_fowler They just don’t appreciate you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.
amy_farrah_fowler Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.
sheldon_cooper I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.
amy_farrah_fowler You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.
sheldon_cooper Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.
amy_farrah_fowler You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
sheldon_cooper Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?
amy_farrah_fowler See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know. Perhaps.
amy_farrah_fowler And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together.
sheldon_cooper You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it was just a thought.
sheldon_cooper No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder.
amy_farrah_fowler It tastes the same.
sheldon_cooper No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.
penny This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.
penny If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?
leonard_hofstadter It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
penny Sorry. I’ll get better.
leonard_hofstadter I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?
penny Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. And when would that be?
penny Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, is Sheldon here?
leonard_hofstadter No, I thought he was with you.
amy_farrah_fowler He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone.
leonard_hofstadter What happened?
amy_farrah_fowler He was really angry that you suggested he move out.
leonard_hofstadter Oh.
amy_farrah_fowler I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
leonard_hofstadter Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?
penny Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s nice.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.
amy_farrah_fowler Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?
penny Amy, get out.
amy_farrah_fowler Right.
sheldon_cooper No.
stuart_bloom Hey, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper What happened?
stuart_bloom I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
sheldon_cooper And you couldn’t put it out?
stuart_bloom I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.
sheldon_cooper So when will you reopen?
stuart_bloom Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
sheldon_cooper So, tomorrow?
stuart_bloom I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.
sheldon_cooper Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.
stuart_bloom Well, sorry I let you down.
sheldon_cooper No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.
stuart_bloom That’ll be $2.99.
sheldon_cooper Really? It’s soaking wet.
stuart_bloom Fine, a dollar.
sheldon_cooper Can you break a twenty?
stuart_bloom No, I only have hundreds.
sheldon_cooper You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.
stuart_bloom That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.
leonard_hofstadter I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?
penny Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna see where he is.
penny How?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.
penny You do that?
leonard_hofstadter Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.
penny He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.
leonard_hofstadter That’s weird.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter He’s at the train station.
penny So? He loves trains.
leonard_hofstadter It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.
penny It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
raj_koothrappali Dude, I’m so sorry.
howard_wolowitz Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?
stuart_bloom No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.
raj_koothrappali We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?
stuart_bloom Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.
raj_koothrappali Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.
stuart_bloom You slept with her? Nice.
raj_koothrappali Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.
howard_wolowitz Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
stuart_bloom Great.
howard_wolowitz I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.
stuart_bloom So what’s the catch?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You tracked my phone?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
sheldon_cooper Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.
penny We were worried about you.
sheldon_cooper Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
leonard_hofstadter Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
sheldon_cooper My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home.
sheldon_cooper No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
penny And go where?
sheldon_cooper It doesn’t matter.
leonard_hofstadter So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
sheldon_cooper I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.
sheldon_cooper Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
leonard_hofstadter Then what can I do?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.
penny Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.
leonard_hofstadter What? Why?
penny It might be good for him.
leonard_hofstadter You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
penny He’s a grown man.
leonard_hofstadter No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.
penny Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.
leonard_hofstadter I know, but…
penny He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
sheldon_cooper Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.
penny Seriously, let him go.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.
sheldon_cooper I do.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. Good luck.
penny Be safe and call us.
sheldon_cooper I will.
leonard_hofstadter Bye, buddy. Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yes?
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna miss you.
sheldon_cooper Of course you are.
leonard_hofstadter He just made that easier.
penny Mm.
stuart_bloom Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.
howard_wolowitz You sure?
stuart_bloom Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, she’s not too much for you?
stuart_bloom Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.
debbie_wolowitz Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?
stuart_bloom Coming, Debbie.
howard_wolowitz You call her Debbie?
stuart_bloom She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.
howard_wolowitz Was that a little weird?
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.
howard_wolowitz Okay, let’s go.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yep.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.
leonard_hofstadter He’s okay?
amy_farrah_fowler Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
penny I really think this is gonna be for the best.
leonard_hofstadter Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…
amy_farrah_fowler How could you let him go?
