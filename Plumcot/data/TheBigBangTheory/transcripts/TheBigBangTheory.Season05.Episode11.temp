penny Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
leonard Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
penny Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
sheldon I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
leonard You want to hear something weird?
penny Sure.
sheldon In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
leonard What are you talking about?
sheldon You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
leonard Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.
sheldon Oh. I thought it was a game.
penny What’s yours?
leonard There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.
sheldon Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.
leonard Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.
penny Basketball Pope.
sheldon And that’s how it’s done.
penny What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
leonard I don’t know.
sheldon Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
leonard No, that was a different guy.
sheldon Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?
leonard No, that was a different, different guy.
sheldon Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
leonard No.
sheldon Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
leonard No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister.
penny All right, well, what do you think he wants?
leonard I don’t know.
sheldon You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
leonard I told you. That was a different guy.
penny Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
leonard It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
sheldon Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
leonard Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
sheldon Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.
leonard Thanks.
sheldon So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?
leonard I didn’t have clams.
sheldon I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
leonard It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
sheldon Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?
leonard You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”
sheldon Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.
bernadette I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?
penny ‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?
bernadette Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.
penny Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
amy When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?
penny Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose.
bernadette I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.
penny Oh, that’s awful.
bernadette Worst part was, it was too big.
amy That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.
penny Wow. You poor thing.
bernadette What about you?
penny Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
amy Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?
penny No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.
bernadette Oh, my God, that’s awful.
penny No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.
amy Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
penny Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
amy Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
penny What? I was not a bully.
bernadette Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
amy Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
raj Is that him over there?
leonard No.
raj How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
leonard You know, I can really do this by myself.
howard Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy.
leonard No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.
howard You wore underwear? You fool.
raj So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?
leonard You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
howard That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?
leonard Scrotum.
raj What’s that one?
leonard Uh, stapled.
jimmy Leonard.
leonard Oh, hi.
jimmy Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you.
leonard Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
jimmy Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now.
sheldon And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
leonard I’m doing okay, I guess.
jimmy Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.
leonard The Newcomb medal.
jimmy Yeah, congratulations.
sheldon Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.
jimmy From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.
sheldon Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?
raj Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.
sheldon My point.
jimmy You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?
leonard Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot.
jimmy Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.
howard Like the Black Death and Europe.
leonard Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.
jimmy Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.
sheldon Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.
leonard What’s the idea?
jimmy This is just between us, right?
leonard Right.
jimmy Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?
raj That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie.
howard How exactly would these glasses work?
jimmy How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd.
leonard I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
jimmy Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known.
sheldon The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever.
leonard Sheldon, I got this.
sheldon You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.
leonard Sheldon.
sheldon Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess.
jimmy I don’t understand.
leonard I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
sheldon A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
raj That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
jimmy What is that?
sheldon This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
leonard 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
jimmy What’s this word?
leonard Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
sheldon You really need to work on your penmanship.
jimmy Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.
leonard It wasn’t fun for me.
sheldon You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.
leonard Come on, guys.
raj That was pretty badass, dude.
sheldon I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
leonard Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.
penny Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.
bernadette You’re doing great.
penny Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.
amy I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt.
bernadette Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now.
penny That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
amy Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
penny Both.
bernadette You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
penny I actually knew that.
amy I never doubted you.
bernadette Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
penny Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?
amy There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.
penny Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?
amy How about donating some of your clothes?
penny Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.
bernadette What about helping people?
penny And helping people.
leonard Here’s your cocoa.
sheldon Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
leonard Yes.
sheldon Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?
leonard You got one for good luck. I’ll get it.
sheldon One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
jimmy Hey.
leonard What are you doing here?
jimmy I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?
leonard Laxative.
jimmy Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.
leonard Really?
jimmy Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.
leonard Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.
jimmy You’re a beautiful guy.
leonard Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.
jimmy Okay, I got to go.
leonard Are you okay to drive?
jimmy Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.
leonard No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.
jimmy I wouldn’t be imposing?
leonard No.
sheldon Yes.
leonard Sheldon, we can’t let him drive.
sheldon Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
leonard You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
jimmy Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner.
sheldon You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
jimmy You mind if I use your bathroom?
leonard Yeah, just back there.
howard How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.
leonard Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
sheldon You know what would be nice?
raj What’s that?
sheldon As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it.
penny Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.
bernadette I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
penny Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.
bernadette Donated.
penny Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.
bernadette Penny.
penny Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!
amy I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable.
sheldon Leonard.
leonard Yeah.
sheldon In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.
leonard What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
sheldon You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
jimmy When did I have tacos?
leonard Morning, Jimmy.
sheldon Oh, there it is, tacos.
jimmy Man, I tied one on.
leonard Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.
jimmy What apology?
leonard For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
jimmy Geez, you’re still harping on that? What a puss.
leonard That’s my French toast.
jimmy It’s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.
sheldon I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.
leonard I might kill him right now.
sheldon The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back.
leonard Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go.
jimmy Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.
leonard No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
sheldon Well said, Boy Wonder.
jimmy Or what?
sheldon Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.
leonard I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! Uh-oh.
sheldon You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.
leonard Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
sheldon I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
bernadette I don’t feel good about this.
penny Then sit in the car and keep it running.
amy You were right, a whole new load.
penny Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.
amy Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.
bernadette God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?
penny Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.
amy What is it, the fuzz?
penny Look at us. What are we doing?
amy I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don’t know about Bernadette.
penny You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here.
bernadette It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!
