sceme The apartment
bernadette Raj, your tag’s sticking out.
raj Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in, like, two years.
bernadette Now I feel a little gross.
raj You’re only making it seem more real for me.
howard Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it’s me.
raj Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
sheldon How about Penny’s depressing acting career?
leonard Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
penny Aw, thank you.
howard Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
raj Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
amy Can I borrow it when you’re done?
penny Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.
leonard Why would you do that?
penny Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
bernadette Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
sheldon She does. 42 minutes in.
raj While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
sheldon I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his problem is.
penny Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
sheldon Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was born to play?
leonard So are you really not gonna do this movie?
penny Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good for my career.
leonard Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
penny Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”
raj If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.
leonard I don’t know anything about show business, so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.
amy I think we’re gonna go.
sheldon Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.
howard Hey, I work at the same university you do.
sheldon Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.
bernadette Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
penny Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
amy I think we’re gonna go.
leonard No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.
sheldon Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.
howard I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.
sheldon I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
raj Ha-a-a. Still funny.
bernadette That was ten years ago.
sheldon Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
amy Really?
howard The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.
raj I was there. It was funny.
sheldon In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
amy Thanks for walking me to my car.
raj Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.
amy Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.
raj I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.
amy Whatever happened with your online dating?
raj No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
amy Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.
raj It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
amy Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
raj What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.
amy That’s true. Do whatever you want.
howard Hey.
sheldon Hello.
howard Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
sheldon Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
howard Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.
sheldon Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
howard Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
sheldon That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
howard Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.
sheldon I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
howard No.
sheldon I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.
raj Amy, I could use some help.
amy Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
raj I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.
amy Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.
raj And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.
amy Great, so what do you need me for?
raj Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
amy All right.
raj Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.
amy Wow.
raj I know. Powerful stuff, huh?
amy No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.
raj Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.
amy Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”
raj Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
amy I’m not gonna pretend to be you.
raj I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
amy Well, what would I say to her?
raj Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.
sheldon Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
penny Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?
sheldon Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
penny Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.
sheldon Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
penny Yes.
sheldon Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine…
penny Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.
sheldon Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
leonard Are we playing individual or teams?
raj Teams are fun.
sheldon Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
raj But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The kind who finish each others…
howard I really don’t think we do tha…
raj Do that. See?
penny Oh, hi.
leonard Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?
penny Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
leonard Yeah, sure.
raj Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
howard Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…
raj Plane tickets? Yeah.
howard Will you please sto…
raj Stop that? Okay.
penny I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can’t drive to auditions.
leonard I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
penny I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
leonard At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
penny How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.
sheldon Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.
penny I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart interfering with your board game?
sheldon It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.
raj Hey, you busy?
amy No. What’s up?
raj Have you heard back from Emily?
amy I have.
raj Great. And?
amy And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.
raj I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.
amy I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
raj I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.
amy Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
raj What’s happening tomorrow night?
amy I’m meeting her for coffee.
raj What?
amy Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
raj I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?
amy No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting.
raj Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
howard That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.
bernadette What are you doing?
howard Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t have an air freshener in your car.
bernadette This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
howard You’re the reason I’m doing it.
bernadette I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
howard How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
sheldon Hello.
bernadette Hi.
howard Hey, buddy.
bernadette You excited for Texas?
sheldon Oh, very much so.
howard It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
sheldon Oh, who’s the real astronaut?
howard Buzz Aldrin.
sheldon Oh. Yay.
sheldon Howard? Howard? Howard?
howard What now?
sheldon I have to go to the bathroom.
howard You just went to the bathroom.
sheldon But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.
howard Well, it still doesn’t.
sheldon I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
howard Fine.
sheldon Why are you getting annoyed?
howard I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
sheldon Like when?
howard When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous.
sheldon Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.
howard Thank you.
sheldon Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?
howard No.
sheldon But I still need to use the bathroom.
howard Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?
sheldon No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
howard Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.
sheldon I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!
howard I’m gonna need that bag back.
leonard You sure you want to do this?
penny Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.
leonard Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.
penny I know. Thank you.
leonard Sorry.
penny It’s just so humiliating.
leonard So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.
leonard Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.
penny Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.
leonard I know. I thought we’d take yours.
penny I don’t understand.
leonard It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.
penny I don’t know what to say.
leonard Don’t say anything.
penny Oh, my God.
leonard I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.
amy Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.
raj Hello, Emily.
emily Hello.
raj Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?
emily No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
raj Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
emily I’m leaving.
amy Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
emily You know, I think I’m just gonna go by myself.
raj Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.
sheldon I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.
howard I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.
sheldon If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my life.
howard Thank you, Sheldon.
sheldon Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.
announcement The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You’re now free to move about the cabin.
howard It’s over.
sheldon Yeah.
howard Should we stop holding hands now?
sheldon In a minute.
howard Okay, good.
