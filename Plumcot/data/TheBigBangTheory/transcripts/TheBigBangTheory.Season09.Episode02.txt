sheldon_cooper Why are you up?
leonard_hofstadter How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.
sheldon_cooper Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny You couldn’t sleep either?
leonard_hofstadter Of course not.
sheldon_cooper Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.
leonard_hofstadter What are we gonna do?
penny I don’t know.
leonard_hofstadter Please, tell me how I can fix it.
sheldon_cooper Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
penny Actually, I think he’s onto something.
leonard_hofstadter You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?
sheldon_cooper I’m currently single.
penny That’s true. You are.
leonard_hofstadter What is happening?
sheldon_cooper I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.
leonard_hofstadter U-u-u-uh!
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.
sheldon_cooper Well, hello to you, too.
amy_farrah_fowler What do you want?
sheldon_cooper I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
amy_farrah_fowler What baby?
sheldon_cooper A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m hanging up.
sheldon_cooper Great. See you in about half an hour.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.
sheldon_cooper Why not?
amy_farrah_fowler Because we’re broken up.
sheldon_cooper Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.
amy_farrah_fowler No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.
sheldon_cooper You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.
sheldon_cooper Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
leonard_hofstadter Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.
raj_koothrappali And you knew about this this whole time?
howard_wolowitz I did.
raj_koothrappali And you didn’t think to tell me?
howard_wolowitz Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
raj_koothrappali Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?
raj_koothrappali Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
howard_wolowitz You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two.
raj_koothrappali I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.
raj_koothrappali Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing here?
sheldon_cooper I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.
amy_farrah_fowler And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
sheldon_cooper On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.
amy_farrah_fowler Just give me the box.
sheldon_cooper Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?
amy_farrah_fowler Fine. My old scarf.
sheldon_cooper You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
amy_farrah_fowler You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?
sheldon_cooper We made one heck of a team, huh?
amy_farrah_fowler Whose bra is this?
sheldon_cooper It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s Penny’s.
sheldon_cooper Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.
amy_farrah_fowler Good-bye.
sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.
howard_wolowitz Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!
bernadette_rostenkowski Hands off. I’m mad at you.
howard_wolowitz Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself.
bernadette_rostenkowski What will pay for itself?
howard_wolowitz Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?
bernadette_rostenkowski I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.
howard_wolowitz And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it.
bernadette_rostenkowski I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.
howard_wolowitz And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess that’s true.
howard_wolowitz And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?
leonard_hofstadter Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Call you back. Hey.
penny Can we talk?
leonard_hofstadter I would love that.
penny All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do.
leonard_hofstadter If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.
penny Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information.
sheldon_cooper Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.
penny Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?
sheldon_cooper Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.
leonard_hofstadter Wake up, wake up, wake up.
sheldon_cooper Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
leonard_hofstadter What? Why?
sheldon_cooper Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.
sheldon_cooper And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
leonard_hofstadter Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.
penny Really? Why is that?
leonard_hofstadter What, you actually want to meet her?
penny No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should.
leonard_hofstadter I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?
sheldon_cooper Yes. And that’s coming from me.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, you want to meet her?
penny No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on.
leonard_hofstadter How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
penny Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.
sheldon_cooper In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.
penny I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
amy_farrah_fowler Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
penny What do you think?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.
penny You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.
amy_farrah_fowler Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that.
penny I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing.
penny You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s because you made him more confident.
bernadette_rostenkowski You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice.
penny I never thought about it like that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, me neither, not until just now.
leonard_hofstadter You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
howard_wolowitz 250 dollars an hour. Why?
raj_koothrappali How do you know?
howard_wolowitz Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.
raj_koothrappali And I’m just hearing about this now?
howard_wolowitz Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.
raj_koothrappali You don’t have to, you should want to.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, great, there’s Mandy.
howard_wolowitz Why are marine biologists always so cute?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not helpful.
howard_wolowitz Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
leonard_hofstadter Are we done?
raj_koothrappali Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?
leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.
howard_wolowitz Leonard, wait.
leonard_hofstadter What?
howard_wolowitz I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.
raj_koothrappali Now we are done.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
mandy_chow Oh, hi, Leonard. What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, do you mind if I sit?
mandy_chow Sure.
leonard_hofstadter So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.
mandy_chow What about it?
leonard_hofstadter You know, what we did, when we were drunk.
mandy_chow Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?
leonard_hofstadter No, we just made out.
mandy_chow Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
mandy_chow Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?
leonard_hofstadter Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.
mandy_chow It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?
leonard_hofstadter Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
mandy_chow Is that really the reason?
leonard_hofstadter What else would it be?
mandy_chow I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship.
leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.
mandy_chow Okay, well, that’s something to think about.
leonard_hofstadter You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.
mandy_chow Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?
leonard_hofstadter I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.
mandy_chow Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.
leonard_hofstadter Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.
mandy_chow Imagine that.
leonard_hofstadter I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.
mandy_chow And your wife is worried about me?
raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more.
sheldon_cooper And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.
amy_farrah_fowler I’m gonna kill him.
sheldon_cooper But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?
penny So, you said you had something to tell me.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?
penny Uh-huh.
leonard_hofstadter I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.
penny I’m listening.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.
penny Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.
leonard_hofstadter You do?
penny Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
penny You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.
leonard_hofstadter Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
penny That sounds nice.
leonard_hofstadter Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.
penny Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.
penny It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?
penny Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, please.
penny Okay.
penny Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift.
sheldon_cooper I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.
leonard_hofstadter What is this?
sheldon_cooper Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Wow.
penny That’s so great.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.
penny We?
sheldon_cooper Is there a problem?
penny Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.
amy_farrah_fowler How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
sheldon_cooper You saw through that one, did you?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.
sheldon_cooper She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.
amy_farrah_fowler I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
sheldon_cooper She was listening through the door. She wants me.
