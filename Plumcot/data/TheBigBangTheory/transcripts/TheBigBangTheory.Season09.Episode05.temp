leonard Hey, ready for lunch?
howard Oh, one sec.
sheldon Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
howard No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.
leonard That’ll teach her to care about your health.
howard Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.
raj When was the last actual exercise you got?
howard The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.
sheldon According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.
raj Are you?
sheldon Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.
leonard It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
howard You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.
leonard Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.
sheldon Had me at flag, lost me at football.
penny Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
leonard What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
penny Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
leonard I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
sheldon Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
leonard It’s indoors, so no sunscreen.
sheldon No throwing, no catching, no running.
leonard No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
sheldon Or worse, up.
leonard Preach.
sheldon And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.
leonard What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
sheldon Ah, touché.
stuart Thanks for coming by.
bernadette Sure. So how can we help?
stuart Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can’t get ’em in here.
penny All right, well, what have you tried so far?
stuart Uh, I’ve, I’ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.
penny Really? In a comic book store?
stuart Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?
amy Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.
stuart Well, you don’t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.
raj I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
leonard I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
sheldon Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have.
raj We can still be swashers.
howard Well said, Puss.
barry Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn’t a joke. I hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike Star Wars.
leonard That’s not why we’re here.
raj Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.
howard And maybe a little Princess Bride.
raj Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.
barry Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.
sheldon We’re not afraid of physical activity.
howard Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
barry Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.
sheldon Oh, dear.
barry What’s wong, Cooper?
sheldon Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.
howard When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
sheldon Right. Always right.
howard He’s a righty.
barry Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.
howard Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.
barry The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.
leonard This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.
barry Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.
sheldon Excuse me, Barry?
barry Yes.
sheldon When can I stab one of my friends?
barry In fencing, we don’t call it a stab. We call it a touch.
sheldon Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.
barry Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.
amy Have you thought about advertising directly to females?
stuart Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid.
penny Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?
stuart Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it.
penny All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.
stuart See? Negative.
barry With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.
raj Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
sheldon En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.
howard My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
raj My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
howard I thought you were Puss in Boots.
raj Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
sheldon I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
leonard What?
sheldon You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
leonard When was your honour insulted?
sheldon My last physical.
leonard Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.
raj My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
howard My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
sheldon Ah, this is fun.
leonard Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.
barry What’s going on with Amy?
sheldon Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.
barry Weawwy? Good to know.
sheldon Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?
leonard Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.
sheldon Well, that’s unacceptable.
leonard Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.
sheldon Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.
leonard Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.
sheldon You really think so?
leonard Of course. She deserves to be happy.
sheldon How dare you.
leonard Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.
sheldon Barry, a word?
leonard And now the crazy version of what I just said.
sheldon If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.
barry And how are you gonna do that?
sheldon By challenging you to a duel.
barry You’ve had one wesson. I’ll destwoy you.
sheldon That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.
leonard Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.
stuart All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem.
penny Yeah.
bernadette You are.
amy You can say it.
stuart Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.
penny Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.
stuart Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.
amy Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
stuart It was a joke.
bernadette Was it?
stuart No, I’m still doing it.
penny Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
stuart I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself.
bernadette That really happened?
stuart I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get.
amy Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
stuart Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you.
amy Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.
leonard I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.
sheldon Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.
leonard If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.
howard Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.
sheldon That’s ridiculous.
raj Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.
sheldon True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.
leonard Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
sheldon There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.
raj Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.
sheldon You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
raj How many sips of that beer did he have?
leonard Three.
howard Oh, boy.
sheldon Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.
woman What?
sheldon It’s a Pokémon reference.
woman I don’t know what that means.
sheldon Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?
older_woman I’m married, and I’m her grandmother.
sheldon Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.
bernadette Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
penny Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
amy I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.
bernadette Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.
penny And sometimes we marry them anyway.
amy Huh. Well, this is weird.
penny What?
amy Barry Kripke just asked me out.
bernadette Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.
penny I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
bernadette What did he say?
amy Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.
penny Well, what are you gonna do?
amy I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.
bernadette What can it hurt?
amy Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.
bernadette You mean, not a scientist?
penny I think she means not a weirdo.
bernadette Are you attracted to him?
amy I don’t know.
penny All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?
amy Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.
sheldon I smell funny. I taste salty.
leonard You’re just sweaty from exercise.
sheldon And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
leonard I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
amy Hello.
sheldon Hello.
leonard We should let you guys talk.
bernadette Yeah.
sheldon You don’t have to leave.
leonard Look at me go.
amy Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.
bernadette Walk.
amy How have you been?
sheldon I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.
amy How’d that go?
sheldon It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
amy Well, actually, he, he already did.
sheldon Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.
amy I said no.
sheldon Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
amy I didn’t know you were interested in dating.
sheldon I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
amy Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good.
sheldon Thanks. And I taste good too.
bernadette Howie?
howard What’s up?
bernadette Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
