amy I must say, Penny, this is great fun.
penny Glad you’re enjoying yourself.
amy Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.
bernadette Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before.
amy Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
bernadette Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
amy You okay in there, bestie?
penny I’m fine.
amy The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine
penny Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.
amy She always this crabby when she urinates?
bernadette We’re really not that close.
penny Screw it. I’ll go later.
amy And I’ll be right by your side.
bernadette Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
penny Oh, that’s nice.
amy No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.
bernadette You think?
amy Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
bernadette Well, what makes me the weakest member?
amy Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.
penny Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
bernadette It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
amy Oh, no. You have to go.
bernadette I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
amy You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage.
penny Wait. What are you talking about?
amy By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.
bernadette I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
amy Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
penny Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
amy How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
bernadette I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
amy Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.
leonard Okay, see you later.
sheldon Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
leonard That is good news. Bye.
sheldon Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
leonard That, that’s brilliant.
sheldon It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.
leonard Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?
sheldon When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.
leonard All right.
sheldon Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.
leonard Elegant.
sheldon That’s because it’s simple.
leonard Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
sheldon And…
leonard And what?
sheldon And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.
leonard Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
sheldon Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines.
leonard Got it. Bye.
sheldon You know I’m right.
leonard I think he’s getting worse.
amy Oh, my metatarsal are barking.
leonard You okay?
amy Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.
leonard Very pretty.
amy Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
leonard Hadn’t really thought about it.
amy Look.
leonard Uh, sure. Very… prominent.
amy Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend.
leonard Sorry.
amy So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?
leonard Yeah. How did you know?
amy I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
priya Hey, you.
leonard Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?
raj The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
priya Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?
raj I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
leonard Really? In front of your sister?
priya We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.
raj Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.
amy I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?
penny No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.
penny The what?
amy Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”
penny Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
amy I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.
penny None?
amy I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
penny Wh… What the hell did she say?
amy She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what.
penny That bitch!
amy How do you want to handle it?
penny Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
amy Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
penny What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
amy I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
leonard You’re kidding. 3-D?
bernadette That’s what I hear.
howard Then the studio must have real faith in it.
leonard Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
priya Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
leonard No.
priya Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?
leonard Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
priya What other thing?
leonard Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?
howard I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.
bernadette She’s also dating an astronaut.
priya Wow. That’s very impressive.
bernadette Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.
leonard Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
sheldon Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. Will the two of you excuse me?
raj I need a hug.
sheldon Sorry, I have company.
raj Come on, Sheldon, open the door.
sheldon I don’t want to hug you.
raj I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.
sheldon Blue, as in depressed.
raj Well, not so much depressed as lonely.
sheldon I don’t know what colour lonely is.
raj What?
sheldon Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.
raj Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
sheldon All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all.
raj What are you doing?
sheldon I’m working on my three-person chess game.
raj Oh, cool. Can I play?
sheldon It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
raj No.
sheldon Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.
raj No, thank you. I’m fine.
sheldon It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
raj I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.
sheldon Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
raj I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
sheldon The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.
raj Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared.
sheldon Yellow. Go ahead.
raj A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
sheldon Fascinating. What’s in it?
raj I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
sheldon I like cows.
raj That’s not the point.
sheldon It was its own point. Go on.
raj I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
sheldon Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
howard Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?
bernadette I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
howard Most of those guys live in Texas.
bernadette Obviously, this one doesn’t.
howard Okay.
bernadette Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!
howard Fine.
bernadette You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
howard I’m not grilling you, I was just curious.
leonard I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.
bernadette Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?
priya I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
bernadette He’s a consultant.
leonard I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
bernadette He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?
howard It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?
penny All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send
amy Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. What do you got for me, wildebeest?
bernadette I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.
amy Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay. We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?
bernadette In the bathroom.
amy Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?
bernadette They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.
amy Just change the subject.
bernadette I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.
penny What?
bernadette They said something about going there this summer.
penny What, are they getting engaged?
bernadette I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!
amy What astronaut story?
bernadette You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.
amy I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.
bernadette Yeah, it’s hysterical.
penny All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.
amy Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
penny Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.
bernadette I don’t want to do this anymore!
penny Don’t you quit on us!
howard Bernie, you okay?
bernadette It was an architect!
raj Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
sheldon I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
raj Okay, let’s see if this drug works.
woman_at_table Can I help you?
raj Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful.
woman Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?
raj India.
woman Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there.
raj It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
woman Uh, okay, sure. Why not?
raj My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
woman Hi.
sheldon Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe.
woman What’s he observing?
raj We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.
sheldon All right.
raj And what is your name?
woman Angela.
raj Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.
angela You’re cute.
sheldon I’d like to buy a scone.
server Oh, I’m sorry, we’re out. We have muffins.
sheldon They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.
angela What are you doing?
raj Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
angela I…
sheldon They were out of scones.
raj Sheldon, I’m talking to someone. You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.
angela Oh, my God.
raj Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!
priya Who wants some more coffee?
leonard Thanks, yeah.
howard Sure.
bernadette Let me help you.
howard Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
leonard Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?
bernadette This trip to India sounds fun.
priya Yeah, I think it will be.
bernadette Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
priya A little. They’re very old-fashioned.
bernadette Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?
priya Oh, God, no. We’re not there yet.
bernadette Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
priya You’ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?
bernadette Yes. Are you writing a book?
priya Why are you getting upset?
bernadette I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.
priya What’s up with you? Bernadette?
bernadette I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school!
howard Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?
leonard I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
sheldon My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
howard Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop
leonard Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
sheldon When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
leonard Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
sheldon I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
raj Hey, I’ve got winners.
