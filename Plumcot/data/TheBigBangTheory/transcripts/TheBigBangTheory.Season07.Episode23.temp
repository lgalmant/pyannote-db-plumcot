bernadette Almost there. You’re doing great.
howard Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.
raj Please hurry.
mrs_wolowitz I don’t need a treadmill.
howard The doctor says you need to get exercise.
mrs_wolowitz I get plenty of exercise.
howard Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.
raj If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
howard She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
raj All right. Now what?
bernadette We set it up in Howie’s old room.
raj Do you know how to set it up?
howard Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.
mrs_wolowitz Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.
raj So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
leonard Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
amy Should we do something for her?
sheldon I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
amy Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.
sheldon I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.
penny Hi.
leonard Hey, how were things on the set?
penny Uh, pretty good, actually.
raj So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
penny Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.
amy Good for you.
penny Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.
leonard I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.
sheldon Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
leonard It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.
sheldon I know.
howard Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.
bernadette Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
howard You mean a forklift?
bernadette Howie.
howard I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.
bernadette Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?
howard Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?
bernadette I would do it for my mother.
howard Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.
bernadette Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?
howard We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
bernadette You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.
howard Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
mrs_wolowitz I need to tinkle.
howard Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
bernadette You are a putz.
howard As advertised.
sheldon Thanks for coming with me.
raj Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?
sheldon I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
raj Is that a real thing?
sheldon Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.
raj Emily, Hey.
emily Oh, hey, Raj.
raj Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.
sheldon Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
emily Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.
raj Are you here alone?
emily No, not really.
raj What do you mean, not really?
man Hey, should we get our seats?
emily Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.
raj Yeah, okay.
sheldon That was awkward, right?
raj Uh-huh.
sheldon Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
raj Yes.
sheldon Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
director And action.
wil_wheaton Please don’t shut me out.
penny Go away. Just go away.
wil I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.
penny What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
wil I was trying to save your life.
penny Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.
wil You can’t give up. I love you.
penny I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.
director And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.
penny Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.
director Let’s just move on. No one cares.
penny Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?
director Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.
leonard Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.
director And who are you?
leonard I’m her boyfriend.
director Isn’t she too hot for you?
leonard A little, yeah.
director Well, boyfriend, get off my set.
penny You can’t do that. He’s with me.
director You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.
penny What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
director Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.
wil Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.
wil Wow, that fell apart really fast.
raj Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
sheldon Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
raj You don’t have to make me anything.
sheldon No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
raj Sorry, I left them in my turban.
sheldon Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
raj Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
sheldon Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
raj But you don’t have sex with her, either.
sheldon Slick, huh?
raj To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
sheldon Have you had intercourse?
raj No.
sheldon Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
mrs_wolowitz I’m hungry again.
howard It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.
bernadette You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.
howard No, it’s not.
bernadette Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.
howard Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
bernadette I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.
howard Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.
mrs_wolowitz I’m still hungry.
howard I’m coming, you big baby.
penny You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.
wil Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.
penny Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.
wil Hey. I just lost a job for you.
penny All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.
wil Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.
penny God, what am I doing with my life?
leonard You having second thoughts about acting?
penny You were on set, you saw what it was like.
leonard Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.
penny Oh, really?
leonard What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?
penny It was over a bowling alley.
leonard Yeah, but there was ample parking.
penny Are you done?
leonard And you were so good in the TV commercial.
penny It was for haemorrhoid cream.
leonard And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
penny Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.
leonard Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
penny Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.
raj I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?
sheldon An interesting question. Well, good night.
raj What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.
sheldon That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
raj What do you mean?
sheldon How many women have you had dates with?
raj Eleven.
sheldon How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
raj Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
sheldon Sure.
raj I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
sheldon Well, now do you see the problem?
raj Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.
sheldon I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
bernadette Howie, I’m back!
howard Shh, I just got her to sleep.
bernadette Sorry.
howard What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.
bernadette They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
howard Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
bernadette So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.
howard A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.
bernadette Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.
howard Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.
bernadette I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.
mrs_wolowitz Howard.
howard Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
raj Hey.
emily Thanks for letting me come over.
raj Of course. Please, come in.
emily I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.
raj Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.
emily I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.
raj It’s okay.
emily Really?
raj Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.
emily Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.
raj Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.
emily Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.
raj Well, me, neither.
emily Okay.
raj Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?
emily Yeah.
raj I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
emily That’s cool.
raj It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?
emily One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.
raj It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.
emily Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?
raj But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.
penny Oh, my God. What a day.
leonard Can I get you anything?
penny No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
leonard With your career?
penny With my life.
leonard Like what?
penny I don’t know. We could get married.
leonard Come on, be serious.
penny I am.
leonard Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?
penny Well, yeah.
leonard So I’m like a bran muffin.
penny What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.
leonard No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.
penny What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.
leonard Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.
penny Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.
leonard No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.
penny You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.
leonard You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.
penny Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.
leonard Then what do you need?
penny You, you stupid Pop-Tart.
leonard Oh. Then I guess I’m in.
penny Really? You guess you’re in?
leonard Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!
leonard So is that it? Are, are we engaged?
penny Yeah, I think so.
leonard All right.
penny What’s wrong?
leonard I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
penny Yeah, it kind of does, huh?
leonard Oh, I know. This might help.
penny Where did you get a ring?
leonard I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?
penny Oh, my God, yes.
leonard This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
howard How you feeling?
bernadette Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.
howard I’m proud of us.
bernadette Me, too.
mrs_wolowitz Where’s my pancakes?!
foreign_nurse Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!
bernadette You were right.
howard Welcome to Team Putz.
