sheldon This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
leonard What do you mean?
sheldon Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?
penny Hi, guys. Hi, honey.
leonard Hey.
howard Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?
sheldon Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
penny You’re boring people sweetie.
sheldon Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.
penny So, what are you guys doing?
howard Celebrating Columbus Day.
leonard We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.
penny Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
sheldon The parade.
penny Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.
leonard What’s he on trial for?
penny Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.
leonard Oh. I’ll be there.
sheldon Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
penny I guess I could serve both.
sheldon You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
howard Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
penny Tur-briska-fil?
howard Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.
penny Raj, what about you?
howard Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.
leonard So, what’s going on with Raj?
howard Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil.
penny Hard to believe, but go on.
howard The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported.
leonard What do you mean, he’s getting deported?
sheldon I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.
howard Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?
penny Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
sheldon Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession.
howard Okay, she’s gone.
raj Sorry. I lost my cool.
leonard So, what’s going on?
raj Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
howard So?
raj So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
leonard So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?
raj You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
sheldon And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
raj I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere.
howard Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?
penny Why doesn’t he just get another job?
howard What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not.
raj Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,
leonard Don’t worry, you’ll find another job.
raj Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
sheldon Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
raj Hello Sheldon.
sheldon Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated.
raj I’m sad.
sheldon I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
raj What are you eating?
sheldon Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
raj Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all.
leonard I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
raj We believe cows are gods.
sheldon Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
raj Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!
sheldon I’m sorry.
raj Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge.
sheldon Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.
raj Thank you.
sheldon And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
howard Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.
raj You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!
howard Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.
raj I’m on it.
sheldon That’s happy, right?
leonard Yeah.
sheldon Nailed it.
prof_laughlin Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?
raj No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
prof_laughlin Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?
raj It’s a little early, isn’t it?
prof_laughlin Not on Proxima Centauri.
raj That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.
prof_laughlin Oh, well done. I have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.
raj Thank you, sir.
woman I’m sorry. Am I late?
prof_laughlin No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She’ll be heading up our data analysis team.
dr_millstone It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias?
raj Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
dr_millstone That’s just fascinating.
raj Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?
howard What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?
raj You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much.
leonard Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.
raj That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.
howard I’m really going to miss you.
raj Will you come visit me in India?
howard Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?
raj Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
howard Tell you what, we’ll skype.
sheldon Gentlemen.
leonard Hey.
sheldon Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
raj No.
sheldon I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…
leonard Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
sheldon I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.
raj You want me to work with you?
sheldon For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
raj Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
sheldon For me.
raj Sheldon, are you busy?
sheldon Of course I’m busy.
raj Shall I wait?
sheldon Yes, please. How may I help you?
raj I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
sheldon For me.
raj Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
sheldon I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
raj Thank you.
sheldon I reject them all.
raj Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
sheldon I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview.
raj Wha… You’re kidding!
sheldon Please.
raj All right.
sheldon So, that’s what you wear to an interview?
raj Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years.
sheldon Oh, pulling strings, are we?
raj Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg.
sheldon Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
penny Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?
leonard Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.
penny Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?
leonard What are you thinking?
penny Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.
leonard You are a dirty girl.
penny Oh, God, how did he know?
howard Hello.
leonard Hi, Howard.
howard Am I interrupting?
leonard Little bit, yeah.
howard Guess I should have called.
penny Yeah, maybe.
howard Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
leonard Uh-huh.
howard But he’s working with Sheldon.
penny Yes, we know.
howard Want me to leave?
leonard You know, whatever.
howard Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.
penny Hey, I happen to love this movie.
howard Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
sheldon All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
raj Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
sheldon I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
raj Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
sheldon This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.
raj All right, let’s buckle down and work.
raj Sheldon.
sheldon What?
raj I need an aspirin.
sheldon Top desk drawer.
raj Thank you.
sheldon Alright?
raj Yes.
sheldon Good.
leonard That was fun. Thank you.
penny Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex.
leonard Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
howard Top o’ the mornin’o ya!
leonard What are you doing here?
howard Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour.
penny Oh, kill me.
howard By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.
penny See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that.
howard What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?
penny Do something.
leonard Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.
howard Sure. ‘sup, homes?
leonard Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
howard Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot.
leonard Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.
penny That’s great.
howard Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun.
leonard Good.
penny Are we terrible people?
leonard I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
penny Get him, bring him back.
leonard Are you sure?
penny Yeah.
leonard Okay. Howard come back.
howard Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.
raj No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
sheldon Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
raj I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
sheldon Astro means star.
raj Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt.
sheldon English is your native language.
raj Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!
sheldon There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
raj My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
sheldon Caca?
raj It means doo-doo.
sheldon All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…
raj Aha! So I am working with you.
sheldon In this context, with me means for me.
raj Ah, well, in this context…
sheldon Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it.
raj Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
sheldon No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.
raj Let me finish.
sheldon You’re defacing my work.
raj I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it.
sheldon Give me the eraser.
raj No.
sheldon I said give it to me.
raj Come and get it.
sheldon Fine. Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!
raj You are not my superior.
sheldon I am in every way.
raj Oh, yeah? Can you do this? Nice working with you. I’m sorry, for you.
sheldon Raj. Raj. Raj.
raj I’m busy.
sheldon Doing what? All right, you’ve made your point.
raj What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
raj So you were wrong.
sheldon I didn’t say that.
raj That’s the only logical inference.
sheldon Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
raj For you or with you?
sheldon In this context for me could mean with me.
raj All right, but I have some conditions.
sheldon I reject them all.
raj I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
sheldon Wait, you have to drive me home.
raj How did you get here?
sheldon I walked.
raj So walk home.
sheldon I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
raj All right.
