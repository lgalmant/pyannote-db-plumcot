A short time ago in an apartment in Pasadena….
THE BIG BANG THEORY
EPISODE 194
THE OPENING NIGHT EXCITATION
It is a period of great tension. Our heroes, Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz and Koothrappali know that tickets to the new Star Wars movie are about to be available for pre-sale.
If they fail in their mission and can’t see it on opening night Sheldon has sworn that they will never hear the end of it for the rest of their lives…
They believe him.
leonard_hofstadter Guys, tickets already went on sale.
sheldon_cooper What?
howard_wolowitz They’re not supposed to be available yet.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what to tell you, but they’re on sale.
raj_koothrappali Wait. You’re sure they’re Star Wars tickets?
sheldon_cooper The Web site’s frozen. I can’t get in.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, me, too.
howard_wolowitz Same here!
raj_koothrappali Guys, they’re gonna sell out.
howard_wolowitz What are we gonna do?!
sheldon_cooper All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.
howard_wolowitz Got ’em.
sheldon_cooper And I will continue to do so!
penny I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.
sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you.
leonard_hofstadter I’m also really happy, but I can’t pretend it’s for you. New Star Wars in three days.
sheldon_cooper Hey, Thursday can’t get here soon enough. I’m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.
penny Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday.
sheldon_cooper And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn’t need anything in that case, ’cause it’s closed.
penny You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
leonard_hofstadter I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
sheldon_cooper But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy’s birthday for me. Surprise, she’s even older. Who saw that coming?
penny Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake.
arthur_jeffries Oh, great. This again.
sheldon_cooper Arthur, what brings you back?
arthur_jeffries Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn’t a, a sex dream.
sheldon_cooper In the past, you’ve come to me when I’m struggling with a dilemma.
arthur_jeffries And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What’s, what’s troubling you?
sheldon_cooper Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn’t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.
arthur_jeffries Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?
sheldon_cooper Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.
arthur_jeffries And they, they, they don’t wear underwear.
sheldon_cooper So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?
arthur_jeffries Uh, do, do you love this girl?
sheldon_cooper Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.
arthur_jeffries Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.
sheldon_cooper By seeing the movie she’d want me to see?
arthur_jeffries Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.
sheldon_cooper You’re right.
arthur_jeffries Great.
sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
arthur_jeffries I don’t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what’s wrong?
sheldon_cooper I wanted to let you know I’ll be spending your birthday with you.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
sheldon_cooper See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.
amy_farrah_fowler Obi-what?
sheldon_cooper I’ll, I’ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?
sheldon_cooper It’s late. Got to go. Bye.
raj_koothrappali Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.
leonard_hofstadter I know. It’s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
howard_wolowitz Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. We’re going to the comic book store. You want to come?
sheldon_cooper No, I can’t. I need to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don’t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you’ll give it to someone worthy.
leonard_hofstadter You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.
sheldon_cooper This is my ticket to Star Wars….
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
bernadette_rostenkowski What happens if I say, come in?
penny Well, find out.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come in.
sheldon_cooper Bernadette. Bernadette. Bernadette.
penny Come in.
sheldon_cooper Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
bernadette_rostenkowski Just come in.
sheldon_cooper For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I’ll stream it on Netflix.
penny We’re sorry. What do you need?
sheldon_cooper Well, as you know, I’ll be celebrating Amy’s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
sheldon_cooper Well, so far, I’ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.
penny Wow. You can really arrange that?
sheldon_cooper Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it’s your birthday at Bennigan’s, they make a fuss. I don’t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.
bernadette_rostenkowski How about something a little more realistic?
sheldon_cooper Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.
penny Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no. She’d be going alone. Well, if you think I’m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.
penny Okay, well, what’s the third option?
sheldon_cooper That I have coitus with her.
leonard_hofstadter What do you think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart?
raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
howard_wolowitz It’s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.
leonard_hofstadter He’s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?
stuart_bloom My, uh, my doctor’s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?
leonard_hofstadter Well…
wil_wheaton Hey, you guys.
howard_wolowitz Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?
wil_wheaton Absolutely.
stuart_bloom Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.
penny Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing.
bernadette_rostenkowski Wild thang.
sheldon_cooper Which do you think she’d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there’s only 8,000 tickets left.
penny Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, are you ready for this?
sheldon_cooper Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I’d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.
penny Sheldon, that’s so beautiful.
sheldon_cooper Then it’s settled. Amy’s birthday present will be my genitals.
amy_farrah_fowler Thanks for taking me out.
penny Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?
bernadette_rostenkowski So where do you want to go?
amy_farrah_fowler I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.
penny Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.
amy_farrah_fowler Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?
penny Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought.
amy_farrah_fowler I think I’ll just stick to Mexican.
bernadette_rostenkowski Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay, what is going on?
penny Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.
amy_farrah_fowler What surprises?
bernadette_rostenkowski We don’t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical.
amy_farrah_fowler You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?
penny Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
amy_farrah_fowler I, I can’t believe it. I, I don’t know what to say.
bernadette_rostenkowski Well, we’re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…
amy_farrah_fowler I do know what to say. Let’s get me waxed.
arthur_jeffries Why isn’t it ever Angie Dickinson’s bedroom?
sheldon_cooper You’re back.
arthur_jeffries It, it doesn’t seem like it’s up to me.
sheldon_cooper I suppose you’re here because I’ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I’ve never done that before.
arthur_jeffries Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.
sheldon_cooper So, can you help me?
arthur_jeffries Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers…
sheldon_cooper Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.
arthur_jeffries Oh, good, good. ‘Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.
sheldon_cooper I think they say junk.
arthur_jeffries What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?
sheldon_cooper This is an important night for us, and I’m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.
arthur_jeffries Sheldon, if, if you’re with the right person, it, it’ll be okay.
sheldon_cooper Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.
arthur_jeffries Well, that’s, that’s very nice of you to say, but I think I’m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.
sheldon_cooper Oh, sure. Well, you’re fun to look at.
raj_koothrappali Tonight’s the night.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, the wait is finally over.
penny I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.
howard_wolowitz Ready to go?
raj_koothrappali Let’s do this.
penny Have fun, guys.
leonard_hofstadter We will.
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe Sheldon gave this up.
howard_wolowitz I know.
leonard_hofstadter We’re gonna have so much more fun than him.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, they’re not.
penny Knowing them, they will.
howard_wolowitz T minus 15 minutes.
raj_koothrappali Oh, did you hear from Wil?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he’s on his way. Time for bladder check.
raj_koothrappali Check.
leonard_hofstadter Check.
howard_wolowitz Check. Wait. Screw it. I’m holding it.
raj_koothrappali What is everyone booing at?
wil_wheaton Hey, guys. What’s up?
leonard_hofstadter Um, hey, Wil. What you doin’?
wil_wheaton I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode11 Star Trek stinks!
wil_wheaton Yeah? Live long and suck it.
sheldon_cooper Birthday girl. Birthday girl. Birthday girl.
amy_farrah_fowler Come in.
sheldon_cooper Oh.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello. Sorry I’m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I’ll, I’m gonna go put these in water.
sheldon_cooper Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you like it?
sheldon_cooper It’s kind of spooky.
amy_farrah_fowler I can change it back.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no. It’s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I’ll be fine.
amy_farrah_fowler So, what’d you have in mind for tonight?
sheldon_cooper I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.
amy_farrah_fowler Um, that sounds nice, but I’m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.
sheldon_cooper Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.
amy_farrah_fowler You mean before you give it to me?
sheldon_cooper Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
amy_farrah_fowler Of course.
sheldon_cooper Why are we saying give it to you like that?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.
sheldon_cooper I see. Is that all right? I’m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I’m gonna need verbal consent.
amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
sheldon_cooper You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.
leonard_hofstadter So, if you don’t like Star Wars, why are you here?
wil_wheaton Oh, I’m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie’s bad, it’s gonna ruin their lives.
raj_koothrappali Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It’s bad. Somebody kill me.
wil_wheaton See? That’s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn’t gonna change at all.
howard_wolowitz He’s right.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. No matter what happens, we’re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you think Sheldon’s actually gonna go through with it?
penny I don’t know. He said he’s ready.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he’d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.
penny Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler So, um, should I get under the covers with you?
sheldon_cooper All right. Hello.
amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
sheldon_cooper Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
amy_farrah_fowler I’m just, um, really nervous.
sheldon_cooper Why?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’ve just built it up in my head. I don’t know what to expect.
sheldon_cooper Neither do I. But we can find out together.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
leonard_hofstadter I’m really nervous.
howard_wolowitz I know. We’ve been waiting so long for this.
raj_koothrappali And we’ve built it up in our heads so much.
wil_wheaton Guys, it’s just a movie.
leonard_hofstadter That’s true.
howard_wolowitz He’s right.
raj_koothrappali It is.
wil_wheaton Although, we all remember Jar Jar.
raj_koothrappali Leonard, I, I’m scared again.
A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away….
sheldon_cooper Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
amy_farrah_fowler Me, too.
sheldon_cooper I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
amy_farrah_fowler That works for me.
wil_wheaton I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.
raj_koothrappali I don’t think I can walk right now.
arthur_jeffries Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don’t think I need any more advice.
arthur_jeffries I, I was just curious. How, how’d it go?
sheldon_cooper Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.
arthur_jeffries But, uh, what, what about Amy?
sheldon_cooper Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn’t have the history with the franchise I do.
arthur_jeffries Okay. Good, good talk.
