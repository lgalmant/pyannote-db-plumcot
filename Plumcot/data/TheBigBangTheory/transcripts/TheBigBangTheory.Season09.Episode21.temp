sheldon I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?
leonard No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.
raj But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
howard But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.
sheldon Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?
leonard But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
raj Well, that’s just Batman.
leonard No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.
howard So does that answer your question?
sheldon Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.
raj Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run.
leonard I thought you were back with Emily.
raj Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them.
leonard You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
raj No, I’m actually dating two women. Later.
leonard Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
howard I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.
leonard Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?
sheldon What, why did you get a party sub?
leonard People are coming over, it looked fun.
sheldon Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.
leonard Your attendance implies it’s not.
sheldon I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.
leonard Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.
sheldon Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.
leonard Oh, you know what? I’m not going.
sheldon Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.
leonard This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
sheldon You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
leonard You’re the only one who eats them.
sheldon And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?
leonard I’m not going, you can’t make me.
sheldon Well, we’ll just see about that.
penny What is the problem?
sheldon He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
penny Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
leonard You have fun. I will not be attending.
sheldon Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.
leonard Thank you.
sheldon Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.
leonard You’re being ridiculous.
sheldon There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.
leonard Can you please talk to him?
penny Well, why are you fighting him on this?
leonard Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.
penny Well, I will still come to your meeting.
sheldon Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.
leonard Why are you taking his side?
penny Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.
sheldon You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.
raj Man, I’m worn out.
howard I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
raj No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting.
howard You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
raj But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.
howard I guess I am lucky.
raj You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?
bernadette Hey, Raj.
raj Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?
bernadette Good. A little tired.
raj I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.
howard You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?
bernadette You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
raj Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.
sheldon Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
penny Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.
sheldon Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.
penny Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.
leonard Leave me alone.
penny If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.
leonard Not funny.
penny You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
leonard Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here.
penny Really? The only adult?
leonard Yeah, that’s right.
sheldon Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.
penny All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.
leonard And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.
sheldon All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
leonard I don’t want to.
sheldon Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.
leonard Stop saying meeting.
sheldon Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.
amy I brought my famous spinach dip.
sheldon Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.
howard I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.
raj Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.
howard There you go again.
raj I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?
howard Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.
raj How could you say that?
howard Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.
raj I never said that.
howard Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
raj Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.
amy What’s going on with him?
penny Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.
sheldon Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.
penny Don’t worry, he’ll come around.
amy Well, I get why he’s annoyed.
sheldon Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.
leonard You love The Simpsons.
sheldon I love Lisa Simpson.
amy Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.
sheldon Wait. You were pretending?
amy Sorry.
sheldon No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.
amy Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.
sheldon Hmm, what do you think?
penny You don’t know?
raj Hey, did I say something to upset you?
howard No, I’m fine.
raj Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.
howard Just drop it.
raj Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.
howard Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?
raj It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.
penny Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.
sheldon Gladly.
leonard Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.
sheldon It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.
howard Wait, what is going on?
penny Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.
amy Do you guys want to watch with us?
howard As long as I don’t have to watch with him.
raj Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.
howard Why do you get to pick?
raj Okay, then you go there.
howard Don’t tell me where to go.
leonard Howard, just come in here.
penny Yeah, come on, Raj.
raj Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
sheldon She did.
howard And I’m gonna eat it all.
howard So what the hell happened?
leonard Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.
howard Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.
amy You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.
howard Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.
leonard If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly. Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.
stuart Hey, Leonard.
leonard Stuart.
stuart Uh, is this not a dress-up party?
leonard No.
stuart Was it ever a dress-up party?
leonard No.
stuart Howard, didn’t you tell me it was a dress-up party?
howard Yeah.
stuart I was told this is where to go if I’m mad at Howard.
penny May I take your cloak?
stuart Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.
sheldon Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.
stuart So what happened with you and Howard?
raj Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.
stuart I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.
leonard I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.
howard Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.
leonard Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.
amy Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less.
leonard Sorry?
amy Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.
leonard Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.
amy Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?
leonard Penny, but…
amy Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?
leonard I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.
amy Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
leonard Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
howard I don’t know. I like the pain of others.
leonard Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.
howard No, she doesn’t.
leonard She defends him all the time.
howard She does not.
amy Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
howard Well, she did. And human resources.
leonard Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
howard Son of a bitch.
leonard You’re, you’re right, it feels good.
raj All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?
stuart Two women, huh?
sheldon Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses.
penny What’s up?
leonard You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.
penny Where’d you get that from?
leonard From Amy.
penny Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?
amy Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
penny I don’t always defend Sheldon.
leonard Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.
penny What about your weird relationship with him?
leonard That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.
howard Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?
leonard I don’t think so. Why?
howard Well just a feeling.
leonard It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
sheldon Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.
amy Sheldon.
sheldon I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.
bernadette He’s gonna be okay.
sheldon Now it’s a fun fact.
stuart Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.
bernadette Why are you dressed like that?
stuart Oh, uh, Howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.
bernadette That wasn’t nice.
stuart No, but he almost died, so we’re cool.
raj You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.
amy How?
raj Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
penny Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.
raj Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.
sheldon Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
raj Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex.
penny There you go.
leonard That’s true.
sheldon Fair enough.
howard Hey.
leonard Hey.
bernadette You all right?
howard I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.
leonard Let’s get out of here.
amy That was scary.
sheldon Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.
raj Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?
stuart How come your head has your face on it?
sheldon They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.
stuart Don’t you guys have anything better to do?
leonard Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.
stuart That’s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!
sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
leonard What?
sheldon I never got to ask my question about Batman.
leonard What is it?
sheldon If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?
penny Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
sheldon I’ll be back.
