sheldon Leonard, are you in the shower?
leonard I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
sheldon I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now.
leonard What?
sheldon Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
leonard I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
sheldon I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
leonard What kind of emergency?
sheldon Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
leonard You might not want to do that.
sheldon I assure you I do.
leonard Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.
sheldon What?
priya Hello, Sheldon.
sheldon What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
leonard We were in here first, you can’t be in here.
sheldon According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.
sheldon Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?
priya Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.
sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny What?
sheldon Move. Move. Move!
sheldon Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?
leonard Yeah, fine.
priya Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.
leonard Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
priya Proceed.
sheldon Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.
priya Can I see the roommate agreement?
sheldon Um, it’s fairly technical.
priya I think I can handle it.
leonard Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
priya All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.
sheldon Do so, do so.
priya Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.
sheldon Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.
priya Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?
sheldon Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
priya My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.
sheldon But…
priya There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works.
leonard Schooled!
priya As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.
leonard Superceded!
sheldon This isn’t over.
leonard No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.
raj Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
priya Seriously?
howard I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
sheldon What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
leonard I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
priya According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night.
sheldon Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s.
howard That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?
priya A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
sheldon No.
all Opa!
sheldon This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.
leonard Not as much as you.
sheldon Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
leonard I got you the lamb kabob.
sheldon Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny Hey. What’s up?
sheldon The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
penny Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.
sheldon A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.
penny Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.
sheldon Shotgun.
penny Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.
amy Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.
bernadette Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
sheldon Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
amy Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.
penny I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
bernadette Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?
amy I need some context.
penny Pantsuits suck.
amy And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.
bernadette Whee-ee-ee!
amy You smell like baby powder.
sheldon It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.
amy Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.
sheldon I don’t know how to process that.
bernadette I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
penny That’s too many S’s for kissing.
bernadette Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
penny Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
sheldon Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s.
bernadette That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
penny Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?
amy I’m available for experimentation.
sheldon Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
amy Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .
sheldon I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
penny Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.
bernadette Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
sheldon No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
amy Really?
sheldon I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
penny Did you take dance lessons?
sheldon Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.
penny Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
sheldon No, you most certainly are not.
bernadette Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
sheldon I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
penny Take us to a place we can waltz.
taxi_driver Where you can what?
sheldon Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature.
taxi_driver Here we go.
amy I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it.
sheldon What happened to you?
penny Shake it baby, shake it!
bernadette Muy caliente, Sheldon!
elderly_korean_gentleman Care to dance?
bernadette Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.
korean How about you?
penny Oh, what the hell. Ooh!
amy How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?
sheldon What’s 16 times 14?
amy My burps taste like cranberry juice.
sheldon And there’s your answer.
amy Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
sheldon If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.
amy I have yoo-hoo.
sheldon It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
amy Make yourself comfortable.
sheldon Thank you. Is someone smoking?
amy Oh, that’s just Ricky.
sheldon You own a smoking monkey?
amy Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
sheldon What’s he doing here?
amy I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
sheldon Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
amy A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.
sheldon is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
amy Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.
sheldon Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
amy Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
sheldon Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.
amy And you want me to kill her? Done.
sheldon No, of course not.
amy I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
sheldon I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.
amy Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
sheldon No.
amy What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
sheldon Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.
amy You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.
sheldon Are you suggesting I play dirty?
amy Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business.
sheldon Fascinating.
amy I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did.
sheldon Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
leonard Morning, Sheldon.
sheldon Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.
leonard Why would I want to do that?
sheldon Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
leonard Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
sheldon Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.
female_voice Self-destruct sequence activated.
leonard What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
sheldon That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.
priya So what happens when it counts down?
sheldon Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.
priya Oh, my God.
leonard What’s the big deal?
priya Trust me, it’s a big deal.
leonard They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?
priya Yeah, of course, just not today.
sheldon 20 seconds.
leonard Are you ashamed of me?
priya Of course not.
leonard Then why can’t we tell your parents?
priya Please, don’t push this.
sheldon He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.
priya Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.
leonard No, he’s bluffing.
sheldon I never bluff. Ten.
leonard It’s blackmail!
sheldon Nine.
priya We give up.
sheldon Eight.
leonard This is ridiculous.
sheldon It’s a laptop with a full charge.
