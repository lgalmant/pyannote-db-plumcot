leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
sheldon_cooper The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
leonard_hofstadter Yes.
sheldon_cooper What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
leonard_hofstadter A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
sheldon_cooper My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.
leonard_hofstadter Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
sheldon_cooper Killed by badger.
leonard_hofstadter How’s that?
sheldon_cooper It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
sheldon_cooper Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?
leonard_hofstadter You can always get a badger and find out.
sheldon_cooper But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.
leonard_hofstadter That long, huh?
sheldon_cooper 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
leonard_hofstadter What’s there?
sheldon_cooper The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.
leonard_hofstadter So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
sheldon_cooper By this much.
leonard_hofstadter Tough break. You want eggs?
sheldon_cooper You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory cold fusion, the dogapus.
leonard_hofstadter What’s a dogapus?
sheldon_cooper A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
leonard_hofstadter Is somebody working on that?
sheldon_cooper I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
sheldon_cooper A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
howard_wolowitz What do we owe you?
leonard_hofstadter It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
howard_wolowitz Here you go.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
penny What?
leonard_hofstadter Never mind. I got it.
penny Oh, you wanted me to pay.
leonard_hofstadter It’s no big deal.
penny No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. What?
howard_wolowitz He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life.
penny Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.
leonard_hofstadter Hmm? How much you got?
penny Nothing.
leonard_hofstadter How can you walk around with no money?
penny I’m cute. I get by.
leonard_hofstadter It’s okay, you can owe me.
penny Okay.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, six bucks.
sheldon_cooper No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.
penny But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.
sheldon_cooper Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.
howard_wolowitz Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?
sheldon_cooper It’s a small price to pay.
penny For what?
leonard_hofstadter No, no, don’t ask.
penny Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
sheldon_cooper In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.
penny Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
sheldon_cooper Correct.
penny So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
sheldon_cooper Essentially, yes.
penny Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?
sheldon_cooper Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.
penny Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
sheldon_cooper Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
howard_wolowitz You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.
sheldon_cooper That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.
penny No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?
howard_wolowitz Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.
penny Oh, my God, that is so creepy!
howard_wolowitz I know! And he says he’s not gonna stop. Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
sheldon_cooper Ugh. U-u-ugh. Lenu-u-ugh.
leonard_hofstadter What the hell? What’s the matter?
sheldon_cooper I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
leonard_hofstadter There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
leonard_hofstadter When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
sheldon_cooper It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!
leonard_hofstadter Have you had your appendix out?
sheldon_cooper I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?
leonard_hofstadter Let’s get you to the hospital.
sheldon_cooper So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
leonard_hofstadter Funny how things work out, isn’t it?
sheldon_cooper Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
leonard_hofstadter Good night.
sheldon_cooper Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
penny Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?
sheldon_cooper No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?
penny I don’t have one.
sheldon_cooper What about your pedometer?
penny Don’t have one.
sheldon_cooper Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
penny Uh, no.
sheldon_cooper What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
penny No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.
sheldon_cooper Why are you doing that?
penny It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
sheldon_cooper All right.
penny All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.
sheldon_cooper I am doing it.
penny Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?
sheldon_cooper We’ll never know.
penny Okay, let’s just warm up on the run.
sheldon_cooper Okay.
penny Okay, let’s go.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
penny Oh, my God, are you okay?
sheldon_cooper I think so.
penny Oh, let me help you up.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Oh, Sheldon!
sheldon_cooper If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
leonard_hofstadter Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.
howard_wolowitz Thank you, sir.
leonard_hofstadter Palak paneer, that’s Penny.
penny Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
penny Hey, what’s my share?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, 12 bucks.
penny Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?
leonard_hofstadter Sure.
penny What am I up to now?
leonard_hofstadter Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
penny What now?
howard_wolowitz He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
penny It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back. Shut up!
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
sheldon_cooper Coming! . Greetings, friends.
leonard_hofstadter Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.
howard_wolowitz Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.
penny Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.
leonard_hofstadter You’re in your bedroom.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 No, I’m not.
leonard_hofstadter I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!
penny So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
sheldon_cooper I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
leonard_hofstadter I am looking at you.
sheldon_cooper No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
leonard_hofstadter You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
sheldon_cooper At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?
leonard_hofstadter At the hands of your roommate?
sheldon_cooper An accident.
leonard_hofstadter That’s how I’m going to make it look.
sheldon_cooper Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, but don’t expect my help.
sheldon_cooper You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s not.
sheldon_cooper Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll be damned.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 This is delightful.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
leonard_hofstadter Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Because I called shotgun. Remember?
leonard_hofstadter Right.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.
leonard_hofstadter Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?
leonard_hofstadter I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.
leonard_hofstadter That’s it. Bye-bye.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Bazinga.
leonard_hofstadter Whoa!
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I have an override switch.
leonard_hofstadter I almost died!
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?
leonard_hofstadter I’m still going to go with you.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.
leonard_hofstadter What about it?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Be a lamb and open it for me.
leonard_hofstadter Why? What’s the problem?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You think you have me stymied, don’t you?
leonard_hofstadter No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.
howard_wolowitz Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.
raj_koothrappali That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.
raj_koothrappali Oh, sure.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 He’s a lamb. You’re not.
raj_koothrappali I’m a lamb.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
howard_wolowitz I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
raj_koothrappali That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes.
penny Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.
leonard_hofstadter Why are you introducing yourself?
penny I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Can you tell me the specials this evening?
penny Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.
penny Because you’re not here.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.
howard_wolowitz Is that Steve Wozniak?
leonard_hofstadter I think it is.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 The Great and Powerful Woz.
leonard_hofstadter Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
penny Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I must speak to him.
leonard_hofstadter Of course you must.
penny You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
steve_wozniak Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
steve_wozniak Only fifteenth?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
steve_wozniak Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.
steve_wozniak Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I’d autograph it for you.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
steve_wozniak Nerds.
sheldon_cooper I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. Ow! Aw.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Penny. Penny. Penny.
penny What up, Shel-Bot?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
penny What do you want me to do?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Sing me Soft Kitty.
penny Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Closer to the microphone.
penny Happy kitty, sleepy…
sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 No. You have to start over.
penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
