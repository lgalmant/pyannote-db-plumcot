amy_farrah_fowler If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?
sheldon_cooper Oh, actually, I would.
amy_farrah_fowler Great, what’d you have in mind?
sheldon_cooper Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.
sheldon_cooper You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.
amy_farrah_fowler Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.
sheldon_cooper You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody.
sheldon_cooper It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
amy_farrah_fowler It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.
amy_farrah_fowler I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
sheldon_cooper Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.
penny Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
sheldon_cooper What happened to them?
penny Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool.
penny Amy wants me to have it.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.
penny But it’s a picture of you.
amy_farrah_fowler And you.
penny But you commissioned it.
amy_farrah_fowler To give to you.
penny But you like it so much.
amy_farrah_fowler So do you.
penny I seem to be losing.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you do.
sheldon_cooper You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?
penny Why don’t you keep it?
sheldon_cooper That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.
penny Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.
sheldon_cooper Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?
leonard_hofstadter Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
sheldon_cooper Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, take the plant.
sheldon_cooper Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up.
bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift.
stuart_bloom Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.
bernadette_rostenkowski A foot massage?
stuart_bloom And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you.
howard_wolowitz This is very nice Stuart, thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?
bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby.
stuart_bloom Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you, but I’m not really sure.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.
stuart_bloom That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.
bernadette_rostenkowski I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
stuart_bloom Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.
howard_wolowitz When would you move in?
stuart_bloom Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
stuart_bloom Okay, then I’ll dust.
bernadette_rostenkowski I did that, too.
stuart_bloom Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard just did that.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, let him do it.
sheldon_cooper Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.
mr_spock_cuckoo_clock#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.
sheldon_cooper It’s one of a kind.
penny So if it breaks there’d be none of it?
sheldon_cooper Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.
leonard_hofstadter So you think you should keep it?
sheldon_cooper I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.
leonard_hofstadter Keep the clock, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Thank you.
penny Thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you?
sheldon_cooper Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?
leonard_hofstadter Let me guess, you want it.
sheldon_cooper Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.
leonard_hofstadter You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care.
sheldon_cooper Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
leonard_hofstadter Well, now they’re yours.
penny Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
sheldon_cooper For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?
sheldon_cooper It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.
leonard_hofstadter You know what? There is one thing I would like.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, take whatever you want.
leonard_hofstadter I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
sheldon_cooper But you don’t even like flags.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I like this one.
sheldon_cooper But I designed it.
leonard_hofstadter But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
sheldon_cooper But you don’t even understand its symbolism.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.
sheldon_cooper Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think you do, but all right.
bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, you cooked?
howard_wolowitz How did you know it wasn’t me?
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess.
howard_wolowitz That’s Raj.
stuart_bloom You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm.
howard_wolowitz It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.
bernadette_rostenkowski You have a Batsuit.
howard_wolowitz It’s pajamas, there’s no cape.
stuart_bloom Hey, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?
stuart_bloom Oh, I’m living here again.
raj_koothrappali Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
stuart_bloom No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.
raj_koothrappali Okay, cool.
stuart_bloom Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready.
raj_koothrappali Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
stuart_bloom Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.
leonard_hofstadter Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
penny Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
penny Are you sure?
leonard_hofstadter Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.
penny What a jerk.
leonard_hofstadter You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?
penny Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.
sheldon_cooper Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too.
sheldon_cooper If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.
leonard_hofstadter All right, I tried.
sheldon_cooper All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
sheldon_cooper It’s a good thing you’re cute.
raj_koothrappali So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that.
stuart_bloom Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house.
howard_wolowitz That’d be great.
stuart_bloom I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
stuart_bloom You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control.
raj_koothrappali Although it was already under control.
stuart_bloom I’m sorry, you mumbled something?
raj_koothrappali It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
stuart_bloom Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.
raj_koothrappali Well, they already had a village.
stuart_bloom I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.
stuart_bloom You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do something, Batman.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper What do you think you’re doing?
leonard_hofstadter Separating my delicates.
sheldon_cooper This is the level you’re stooping to.
leonard_hofstadter No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.
stuart_bloom Hey, what’s up?
raj_koothrappali I’m here to put the crib together.
stuart_bloom Ooh, sorry, I already did it.
raj_koothrappali Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.
stuart_bloom Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com
raj_koothrappali Why are you being like this?
stuart_bloom Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.
raj_koothrappali Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.
stuart_bloom Why can’t there be four wheels?
raj_koothrappali Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?
stuart_bloom Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.
raj_koothrappali Thank you.
stuart_bloom If you’re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.
penny I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?
leonard_hofstadter No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?
strange_old_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 Hey, how you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, can I help you?
strange_old_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 I don’t think so, but you’re sweet for asking.
penny What, what are you doing in our apartment?
strange_old_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.
leonard_hofstadter Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here.
sheldon_cooper So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?
sheldon_cooper My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
theodore It’s like the ’40s again.
sheldon_cooper Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.
penny All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.
sheldon_cooper That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID.
theodore Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative.
sheldon_cooper And now you know as much about him as I do.
raj_koothrappali Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?
bernadette_rostenkowski Great, go with the giraffes.
stuart_bloom Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras.
stuart_bloom Good choice, boss.
raj_koothrappali At least my nose is naturally brown.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, could you please go to the market for me?
howard_wolowitz Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you.
howard_wolowitz Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them.
bernadette_rostenkowski Please just go to the store.
howard_wolowitz Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
raj_koothrappali Me
stuart_bloom I’ll do it.
bernadette_rostenkowski Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
penny What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
leonard_hofstadter And just leave him here alone?
penny Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?
theodore Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous.
theodore I like the painting. Is that your mom?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, get out here.
sheldon_cooper Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?
leonard_hofstadter We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
sheldon_cooper I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
leonard_hofstadter Because you were being selfish.
sheldon_cooper Dividing our belongings is difficult.
leonard_hofstadter Why? I said I didn’t care.
theodore Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.
theodore Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.
amy_farrah_fowler I think he might be right. Also, who is that?
sheldon_cooper I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.
leonard_hofstadter Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone.
theodore If you’re looking for a new guy to live with.
leonard_hofstadter No.
penny We’re good, thank you.
amy_farrah_fowler So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’d like that, too.
sheldon_cooper In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
leonard_hofstadter You promise?
sheldon_cooper I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
theodore Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine.
penny Little lower to the left. A little more.
leonard_hofstadter Good?
penny No, still hideous.
leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there.
penny Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.
theodore I think it brings the room together.
howard_wolowitz Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?
raj_koothrappali I’ll do it.
stuart_bloom Why do you get to do it? I’m the artist.
raj_koothrappali Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
stuart_bloom Just because I look sickly doesn’t mean I’m starving.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard!
howard_wolowitz Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.
bernadette_rostenkowski I think I’m in labour.
howard_wolowitz Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.
stuart_bloom I’ll get the hospital bag.
raj_koothrappali I’ll pull the van up.
stuart_bloom Meet you outside in 2 minutes.
raj_koothrappali Team Baby, go.
howard_wolowitz I love you.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love you, too.
stuart_bloom Are we hugging or having a baby? Let’s go.
