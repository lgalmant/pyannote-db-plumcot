sheldon_cooper Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.
raj_koothrappali What did they give you?
sheldon_cooper Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
leonard_hofstadter I don't believe it.
sheldon_cooper I know, it's basic culinary science.
leonard_hofstadter Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
howard_wolowitz A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?
leonard_hofstadter No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice.
raj_koothrappali Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough.
howard_wolowitz Oh, that's cool.
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
raj_koothrappali It's only $800?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. And that's my bid.
sheldon_cooper You bid $800.
leonard_hofstadter It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.
sheldon_cooper There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
howard_wolowitz Do you have $800?
leonard_hofstadter Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
howard_wolowitz Don't worry, the way these things work there's people waiting 'til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it's called sniping.
raj_koothrappali Fifteen seconds.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, snipers.
raj_koothrappali Ten, nine, eight...
leonard_hofstadter Where are your snipers?
raj_koothrappali Five.
leonard_hofstadter Snipe.
raj_koothrappali Four.
leonard_hofstadter Snipe.
raj_koothrappali Three.
leonard_hofstadter Snipe!
raj_koothrappali Two.
leonard_hofstadter SNIPE!
raj_koothrappali One.
leonard_hofstadter Aaaa-aw!
raj_koothrappali Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.
howard_wolowitz You lucky duck.
sheldon_cooper I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it.
howard_wolowitz Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.
raj_koothrappali A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Need you ask? But I still don't understand why no-one else bid.
sheldon_cooper I understand why no-one else bid.
raj_koothrappali Did the listing actually say miniature?
leonard_hofstadter I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
sheldon_cooper In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets 'no longer want my time machine' and 'need $800'.
howard_wolowitz It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.
raj_koothrappali Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
leonard_hofstadter How are we going to get it upstairs?
howard_wolowitz If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
leonard_hofstadter Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years.
sheldon_cooper I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?
howard_wolowitz Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away. No, that baby's broken.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, guys, push.
howard_wolowitz If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.
raj_koothrappali I can't feel my fingers, hurry up.
sheldon_cooper It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Yeah.
raj_koothrappali If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one.
penny Oh, hey guys.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, hi Penny. Take a break, guys!
penny What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, just, you know, moving... something upstairs.
penny What is it?
leonard_hofstadter It's... you know, time machine.
penny Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so...
leonard_hofstadter Uh, just give us a few minutes.
penny I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.
sheldon_cooper Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.
penny You're joking, right?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
penny Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not... never mind.
sheldon_cooper For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.
leonard_hofstadter Let's just do this. Guys, ready to push?
raj_koothrappali In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
sheldon_cooper I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
sheldon_cooper The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.
howard_wolowitz Talk about your chick magnets.
raj_koothrappali Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!
sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.
howard_wolowitz You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, 'you wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,' how lame is that?
raj_koothrappali He's got a point.
sheldon_cooper Alright, I think we're going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.
leonard_hofstadter Seconded.
howard_wolowitz I was going to put down a towel.
raj_koothrappali I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
leonard_hofstadter That sounds fair.
sheldon_cooper Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?
raj_koothrappali Twice a month.
sheldon_cooper Then no.
raj_koothrappali Okay, every other month.
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876.
howard_wolowitz Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.
sheldon_cooper Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too.
leonard_hofstadter So, when it's your turn you can.
sheldon_cooper But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up.
raj_koothrappali Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
howard_wolowitz And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, 'hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?'
raj_koothrappali Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock.
sheldon_cooper Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, how far into the future?
sheldon_cooper If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. That was fun.
raj_koothrappali My turn.
penny Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.
leonard_hofstadter Are you okay?
penny Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.
leonard_hofstadter That doesn't sound too bad.
penny It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
penny Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this...
sheldon_cooper Time machine.
leonard_hofstadter The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?
penny No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that...
sheldon_cooper Again, time machine.
penny Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.
sheldon_cooper It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
penny Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.
raj_koothrappali My turn!
sheldon_cooper Leonard, it's two in the morning.
leonard_hofstadter So?
sheldon_cooper So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
leonard_hofstadter Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
sheldon_cooper You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.
leonard_hofstadter Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
sheldon_cooper Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.
leonard_hofstadter What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
sheldon_cooper It won't change the past.
leonard_hofstadter But it would make the present so much nicer.
sheldon_cooper Are you upset about something?
leonard_hofstadter What was your first clue?
sheldon_cooper Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability...
leonard_hofstadter Yes I'm upset.
sheldon_cooper Oh! I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, good for you.
sheldon_cooper Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?
leonard_hofstadter I don't know. Maybe.
sheldon_cooper Wow, I'm on fire tonight.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.
sheldon_cooper I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks for pointing it out.
sheldon_cooper In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.
leonard_hofstadter Those are movies.
sheldon_cooper Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, guys, push.
howard_wolowitz If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.
penny Oh, hey guys.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, hi Penny. Take a break, guys!
penny What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine.
penny Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so...
leonard_hofstadter No problem. Hang on.
penny But, what about your time machine.
leonard_hofstadter Some things are more important than toys.
penny Oh, I'm scared.
leonard_hofstadter Don't worry baby, I've got you.
penny Oh, Leonard.
sheldon_cooper It's still my turn.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
leonard_hofstadter I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
sheldon_cooper Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
leonard_hofstadter It's not about money.
raj_koothrappali We brought food.
howard_wolowitz Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.
leonard_hofstadter Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
raj_koothrappali Why?
leonard_hofstadter Because I don't want it any more.
howard_wolowitz Why?
leonard_hofstadter Just... personal reasons.
sheldon_cooper My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Look, do you want to buy me out or not?
raj_koothrappali I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.
howard_wolowitz Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage.
leonard_hofstadter I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
raj_koothrappali Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.
sheldon_cooper I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.
raj_koothrappali Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.
leonard_hofstadter No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.
howard_wolowitz You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana.
raj_koothrappali More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer?
leonard_hofstadter Not for long.
raj_koothrappali Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.
raj_koothrappali Too bad, I called dibs.
howard_wolowitz Well you can't just call dibs.
raj_koothrappali I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.
sheldon_cooper Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.
leonard_hofstadter It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.
raj_koothrappali Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
howard_wolowitz Will you forget dibs!
leonard_hofstadter He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
sheldon_cooper What's the number, I'll match it.
raj_koothrappali I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.
sheldon_cooper What's the exchange rate.
raj_koothrappali None of your business. Take it or leave it.
howard_wolowitz Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.
leonard_hofstadter Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.
sheldon_cooper Who cares, as long as you pick me.
raj_koothrappali Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.
sheldon_cooper No. I can't let you do this.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, get out of my way.
sheldon_cooper None shall pass.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek, The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.
howard_wolowitz Okay man, be cool, we're all friends here.
penny What the hell's going on?
sheldon_cooper You hypocrite!
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Little Miss 'grown ups don't play with toys'. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!
penny Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.
leonard_hofstadter No, I needed to hear it.
penny No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.
howard_wolowitz I guess that makes me large breasts.
leonard_hofstadter Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life.
penny Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
penny Oh. Wow. Good for you.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later...
good_looking_man_coming_up_stairs#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 Excuse me. Hey, Penny!
penny Hi Mike.
mike Are you ready to go.
penny Yeah, I just have to change.
mike I'll give you a hand.
penny Oh, stop it! Bye guys.
leonard_hofstadter My turn on the time machine.
sheldon_cooper It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp!
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you okay?
sheldon_cooper We have to get rid of the time machine.
leonard_hofstadter It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, that's the problem, it's too big.
leonard_hofstadter I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas.
sheldon_cooper Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. Leonard!!!!!!!!
