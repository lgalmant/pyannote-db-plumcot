sheldon_cooper So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it's unobserved it will, however, if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.
leonard_hofstadter Agreed, what's your point?
sheldon_cooper There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
althea Hang on.
leonard_hofstadter One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is... move your finger... phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
althea Can I help you?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?
althea If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
sheldon_cooper I think this is the place.
althea Fill these out.
leonard_hofstadter Thank-you. We'll be right back.
althea Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
leonard_hofstadter What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro.
sheldon_cooper No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
sheldon_cooper I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.
leonard_hofstadter I'm sure she'll still love him.
sheldon_cooper I wouldn't.
leonard_hofstadter Well, what do you want to do?
sheldon_cooper I want to leave.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper What's the protocol for leaving?
leonard_hofstadter I don't know, I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
sheldon_cooper Let's try just walking out.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
althea Bye.
sheldon_cooper Bye-bye
leonard_hofstadter See you.
sheldon_cooper Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
leonard_hofstadter Not really.
sheldon_cooper If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.
leonard_hofstadter I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.
sheldon_cooper No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.
leonard_hofstadter Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
sheldon_cooper No, that was the result of my work with lasers.
leonard_hofstadter New neighbor?
sheldon_cooper Evidently.
leonard_hofstadter Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
sheldon_cooper Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.
penny Oh, hi!
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hi.
penny Hi?
leonard_hofstadter We don't mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.
penny Oh, that's nice.
leonard_hofstadter Oh... uh... no... we don't live together... um... we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
penny Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor, Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Leonard, Sheldon.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hi.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.
penny Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, great.
penny Great.
sheldon_cooper Great.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Well, bye.
penny Bye.
sheldon_cooper Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Should we have invited her for lunch?
sheldon_cooper No. We're going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
leonard_hofstadter We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
sheldon_cooper Not with commentary.
leonard_hofstadter I think we should be good neighbors, invite her over, make her feel welcome.
sheldon_cooper We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
leonard_hofstadter Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
sheldon_cooper I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, and you've never met one of them.
sheldon_cooper That's the beauty of it.
leonard_hofstadter I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.
sheldon_cooper Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
leonard_hofstadter Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
sheldon_cooper To what end?
leonard_hofstadter Hi. Again.
penny Hi.
sheldon_cooper Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Hi.
penny Hi.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.
penny Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, yes.
penny Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to.
leonard_hofstadter Great.
penny So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
sheldon_cooper Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, make yourself at home.
penny Okay, thankyou.
leonard_hofstadter You're very welcome.
penny This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?
sheldon_cooper Actually that's my work.
penny Wow.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke, it's a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.
penny So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.
sheldon_cooper Yeah.
penny This is really impressive.
leonard_hofstadter I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.
penny Holy smokes.
sheldon_cooper If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below 'here I sit broken hearted?'
leonard_hofstadter At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
sheldon_cooper I didn't invent them, they're there.
leonard_hofstadter In what universe?
sheldon_cooper In all of them, that is the point.
penny Uh, do you guys mind if I start?
sheldon_cooper Um, Penny, that's where I sit.
penny So, sit next to me.
sheldon_cooper No, I sit there.
penny What's the difference?
sheldon_cooper What's the difference?
leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
sheldon_cooper In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
penny Do you want me to move?
sheldon_cooper Well.
leonard_hofstadter Just sit somewhere else.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, sit!
sheldon_cooper Aaah!
leonard_hofstadter Well, this is nice. We don't have a lot of company over.
sheldon_cooper That's not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
leonard_hofstadter Yes I know, but...
sheldon_cooper Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
leonard_hofstadter Yes, I remember.
sheldon_cooper I resent you saying we don't have company.
leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry.
sheldon_cooper That is an antisocial implication.
leonard_hofstadter I said I'm sorry.
penny So, Klingon boggle?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it's like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you.
penny Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
sheldon_cooper Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.
penny Participate in the what?
leonard_hofstadter I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.
penny Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.
sheldon_cooper That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
leonard_hofstadter Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?
penny Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.
sheldon_cooper You're lactose intolerant.
leonard_hofstadter I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea.
penny Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
leonard_hofstadter So it's based on your life?
penny No, I'm from Omaha.
leonard_hofstadter Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.
penny I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Well it sounds wonderful.
penny It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
sheldon_cooper What's happening.
leonard_hofstadter I don't know.
penny Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School.
sheldon_cooper It took you four years to get through High School?
leonard_hofstadter Don't.
penny I just, I can't believe I trusted him.
leonard_hofstadter Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
sheldon_cooper You? No, you'll only make it worse.
penny You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.
penny Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.
leonard_hofstadter Our shower works.
penny Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper No?
leonard_hofstadter No.
sheldon_cooper No.
leonard_hofstadter It's right down the hall.
penny Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
sheldon_cooper Well, this is an interesting development.
leonard_hofstadter How so?
sheldon_cooper It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
leonard_hofstadter That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode.
sheldon_cooper Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.
leonard_hofstadter The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
sheldon_cooper So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
sheldon_cooper That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.
leonard_hofstadter Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.
sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.
leonard_hofstadter What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?
sheldon_cooper Yes, but not of the same species.
leonard_hofstadter I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
sheldon_cooper Oh, of course.
leonard_hofstadter That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.
sheldon_cooper Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
leonard_hofstadter It's Darth Vader shampoo.Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
howard_wolowitz Wait till you see this.
raj_koothrappali It's fantastic. Unbelievable.
leonard_hofstadter See what?
howard_wolowitz It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
leonard_hofstadter This is not a good time.
howard_wolowitz It's before he became a creepy computer voice.
leonard_hofstadter That's great, you guys have to go.
raj_koothrappali Why?
leonard_hofstadter It's just not a good time.
sheldon_cooper Leonard has a lady over.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?
leonard_hofstadter No. And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbor.
howard_wolowitz Hang on, there really is a lady here?
leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
howard_wolowitz And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?
leonard_hofstadter I'm not anticipating coitus.
howard_wolowitz So she's available for coitus?
leonard_hofstadter Can we please stop saying coitus?
sheldon_cooper Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
penny Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower? Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!
howard_wolowitz Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.
penny Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.
howard_wolowitz Bon douche.
penny I'm sorry?
howard_wolowitz It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
leonard_hofstadter Save it for your blog, Howard.
howard_wolowitz See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I'm sorry.
penny Okay. Thanks.
leonard_hofstadter You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll...
penny Hey, Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter The hair products are Sheldon's.
penny Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.
leonard_hofstadter A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.
penny It's okay if you say no.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, I'll probably say yes.
penny It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.
leonard_hofstadter Wow.
sheldon_cooper I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
leonard_hofstadter Must we?
sheldon_cooper Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?
leonard_hofstadter She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.
leonard_hofstadter Which is?
sheldon_cooper You think with your penis.
leonard_hofstadter That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.
sheldon_cooper Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.
sheldon_cooper No I don't. And neither do you.
leonard_hofstadter Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.
sheldon_cooper You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.
leonard_hofstadter To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
sheldon_cooper So we get to have a scene with him?
leonard_hofstadter No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
penny So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?
penny Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?
howard_wolowitz Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.
penny Really, why?
howard_wolowitz He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?
leonard_hofstadter I'll do the talking.
voice_from_buzzer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter What did I just... Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV.
voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 Get lost.
sheldon_cooper Okay, thanks for your time.
leonard_hofstadter We're not going to give up just like that.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, the TV is in the building, we've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.
leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
sheldon_cooper My apologies. What's your plan.
sheldon_cooper It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
sheldon_cooper What do you think their combined IQ is?
leonard_hofstadter Just grab the door.
leonard_hofstadter This is it. I'll do the talking.
sheldon_cooper Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.
kurt Yeah?
leonard_hofstadter I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper From the intercom.
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 How the hell did you get in the building?
leonard_hofstadter Oh. We're scientists.
sheldon_cooper Tell him about our IQ.
sheldon_cooper Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper My mom bought me those pants.
leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry.
sheldon_cooper You're going to have to call her.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.
sheldon_cooper It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.
leonard_hofstadter And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
sheldon_cooper Well you got me out of my pants.
leonard_hofstadter Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I've got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.
sheldon_cooper Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.
leonard_hofstadter Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.
sheldon_cooper And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
howard_wolowitz This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.
penny Wow, cool tiger.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
penny Uh, sounds interesting.
howard_wolowitz So you'll think about it?
penny Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.
raj_koothrappali Smooth.
leonard_hofstadter We're home.
penny Oh, my God, what happened?
leonard_hofstadter Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
penny I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
leonard_hofstadter No, it was a valid hypothesis.
sheldon_cooper That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
penny Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?
leonard_hofstadter Really? Great.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?
leonard_hofstadter Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
sheldon_cooper Not to mention imaginary.
leonard_hofstadter Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
penny Sure.
sheldon_cooper We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.
penny So?
sheldon_cooper They're both curry based cuisines.
penny So?
sheldon_cooper They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
penny Any ideas Raj?
howard_wolowitz Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
penny That sounds like fun.
howard_wolowitz Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
sheldon_cooper I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable Mack Daddy.
