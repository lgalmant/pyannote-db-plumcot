ira_flatow This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.
ira_flatow So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.
sheldon_cooper Yes.
ira_flatow And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.
sheldon_cooper Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.
ira_flatow It’s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.
sheldon_cooper Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
ira_flatow That’s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn’t that be unusual? Because you’re a physicist.
sheldon_cooper Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.
sheldon_cooper President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar.
amy_farrah_fowler I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.
leonard_hofstadter Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.
penny How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.
sheldon_cooper But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
penny Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.
bernadette_rostenkowski Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?
howard_wolowitz I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.
bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here.
howard_wolowitz Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he’s seen worse.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
howard_wolowitz I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week.
bernadette_rostenkowski The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?
bernadette_rostenkowski No.
howard_wolowitz Then you left me no choice.
bernadette_rostenkowski I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest.
howard_wolowitz I know, but they’re tenting his building. He can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.
bernadette_rostenkowski He’s bringing Cinnamon?
howard_wolowitz For a whole week, the nerve of some people.
sheldon_cooper Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, can I come in?
sheldon_cooper Do you have cookies?
amy_farrah_fowler No.
sheldon_cooper Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon. It’s been a while.
sheldon_cooper Why are you here?
wil_wheaton Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?
sheldon_cooper Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.
wil_wheaton Yeah, I know a little something about that.
sheldon_cooper Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
wil_wheaton I remember why it’s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.
sheldon_cooper How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?
wil_wheaton Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.
sheldon_cooper That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.
wil_wheaton Yeah, I’m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so…
wil_wheaton I’m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher’s shadow. But now, it’s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it’s a part that I’m happy is there.
sheldon_cooper I do see what you’re saying. That helps.
wil_wheaton Good.
sheldon_cooper Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
wil_wheaton Sure.
amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
sheldon_cooper Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.
sheldon_cooper You should probably go.
howard_wolowitz You’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
raj_koothrappali No, I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth.
howard_wolowitz Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.
raj_koothrappali And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.
bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?
howard_wolowitz No, we were waiting for you.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that’s so sweet.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. So what do you feel like making?
raj_koothrappali Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Raj, you’re our guest.
raj_koothrappali Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.
howard_wolowitz No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you, Raj.
raj_koothrappali Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic.
howard_wolowitz Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.
raj_koothrappali Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.
howard_wolowitz I thought of you the whole time.
raj_koothrappali All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen.
bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
raj_koothrappali There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.
sheldon_cooper Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you’re in a good mood.
sheldon_cooper I’m in a great mood.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.
sheldon_cooper Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
sheldon_cooper So no more interviews?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s all over.
sheldon_cooper I can’t believe it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you’re welcome.
sheldon_cooper You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too.
leonard_hofstadter I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
sheldon_cooper By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other.
sheldon_cooper That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,
penny Hey, what’s with all the yelling?
sheldon_cooper Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
penny Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,
sheldon_cooper That’s it, I’m down to seven friends.
penny He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?
sheldon_cooper When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.
leonard_hofstadter The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.
sheldon_cooper Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight.
leonard_hofstadter Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
penny Actually, I get what he’s saying.
sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.
penny It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.
sheldon_cooper I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.
sheldon_cooper No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, I’ll publish.
sheldon_cooper Can you believe this guy?
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw! Raj did the dishes.
howard_wolowitz How do you know I didn’t do them?
bernadette_rostenkowski Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.
raj_koothrappali Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, you didn’t have to do that.
raj_koothrappali Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park.
bernadette_rostenkowski What presentation do I have today?
howard_wolowitz Just go.
raj_koothrappali He loves you.
howard_wolowitz What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?
raj_koothrappali I’m just being a good house guest.
howard_wolowitz No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?
raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.
howard_wolowitz I don’t want coffee.
raj_koothrappali That’s why I got you hot chocolate.
howard_wolowitz Give me that. Just stop showing me up.
raj_koothrappali Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.
howard_wolowitz Um, is this getting weird?
raj_koothrappali Hang on.
howard_wolowitz So, yes.
leonard_hofstadter Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.
sheldon_cooper I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
leonard_hofstadter These things happen all the time, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
barry_kripke Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, don’t give him a hard time.
barry_kripke I’m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.
leonard_hofstadter It’s not a big deal.
barry_kripke It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, Barry, that’s enough.
sheldon_cooper No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy.
barry_kripke Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it.
sheldon_cooper You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.
barry_kripke Of course you do. Because you’re the Wetwactor.
bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.
raj_koothrappali Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.
bernadette_rostenkowski Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?
howard_wolowitz What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?
bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, really?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em.
bernadette_rostenkowski Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em.
howard_wolowitz I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them.
raj_koothrappali Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.
bernadette_rostenkowski This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.
bernadette_rostenkowski You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
howard_wolowitz Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.
raj_koothrappali Oh, what did I do?
howard_wolowitz You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.
raj_koothrappali Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page.
howard_wolowitz Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.
bernadette_rostenkowski I back you up all the time.
howard_wolowitz That is not… he’s doing it again.
bernadette_rostenkowski What is wrong with you?
leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe they kicked you out.
raj_koothrappali I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again.
penny Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
sheldon_cooper What’s that animal doing in our apartment?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out.
sheldon_cooper I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
penny You know, if it makes you feel any better…
sheldon_cooper It probably won’t.
penny You’re probably right.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?
sheldon_cooper Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.
amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Rajesh.
raj_koothrappali And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.
amy_farrah_fowler You should probably go.
ira_flatow I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.
ira_flatow It’s all right.
sheldon_cooper Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?
ira_flatow No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?
leonard_hofstadter Well…
sheldon_cooper I believe I can answer that.
leonard_hofstadter He asked me.
sheldon_cooper Fine.
leonard_hofstadter As I was saying…
sheldon_cooper You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.
ira_flatow You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you.
sheldon_cooper What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
ira_flatow Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
sheldon_cooper Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.
penny You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.
amy_farrah_fowler A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?
sheldon_cooper You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll get the vodka.
