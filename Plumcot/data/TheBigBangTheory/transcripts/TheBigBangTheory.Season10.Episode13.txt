penny What, what’s all this?
leonard_hofstadter Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.
penny Oh, that is so thoughtful.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?
penny Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it.
leonard_hofstadter and this wine is why.
penny Oh. Hey, what smells so good?
leonard_hofstadter I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
penny Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
leonard_hofstadter Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself.
penny Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this.
leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.
penny You did not just quote an Nsync song.
leonard_hofstadter I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
penny Oh.
leonard_hofstadter Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
leonard_hofstadter That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
sheldon_cooper That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?
leonard_hofstadter Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
sheldon_cooper Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
leonard_hofstadter If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me.
sheldon_cooper Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.
leonard_hofstadter So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.
sheldon_cooper At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?
leonard_hofstadter Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?
penny I hadn’t really thought about it.
amy_farrah_fowler But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.
bernadette_rostenkowski Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
amy_farrah_fowler Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him.
bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real.
penny Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?
bernadette_rostenkowski Uh oh, what’s going on?
penny Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.
bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now.
amy_farrah_fowler Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
penny Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out.
howard_wolowitz All right, got Halley to sleep.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room.
raj_koothrappali Have you tried anything to fix it?
howard_wolowitz Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help.
raj_koothrappali I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?
howard_wolowitz Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
raj_koothrappali Did that do anything?
howard_wolowitz Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug.
sheldon_cooper If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. Good game.
penny Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?
penny Oh, it was fine.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
penny Uh, chips.
sheldon_cooper Anything to drink?
penny Some wine.
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.
leonard_hofstadter Just ignore him.
penny Hm. At least he took an interest.
leonard_hofstadter What’s that supposed to mean?
penny Nothing.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, what’s going on with you?
penny I don’t want to talk about it.
leonard_hofstadter Well, hey, come on, just tell me.
penny Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
leonard_hofstadter What? Where is this coming from?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.
penny It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more.
leonard_hofstadter That is ridiculous.
penny This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.
leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
penny Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.
leonard_hofstadter Fine, go ahead.
sheldon_cooper Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.
bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.
howard_wolowitz That sounds expensive.
raj_koothrappali Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.
howard_wolowitz MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.
raj_koothrappali Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?
howard_wolowitz No.
raj_koothrappali Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?
howard_wolowitz No.
bernadette_rostenkowski I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
howard_wolowitz Is that supposed to be funny?
raj_koothrappali Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny.
penny All right, we’re heading out.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
sheldon_cooper And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
amy_farrah_fowler I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.
leonard_hofstadter Have fun.
penny Thanks. Are you ready?
amy_farrah_fowler Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
leonard_hofstadter Go ahead, it’s fine.
sheldon_cooper Bye.
amy_farrah_fowler Bye.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
penny Let’s go.
amy_farrah_fowler Bye.
sheldon_cooper Bye.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll miss you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, I’ll miss you too.
amy_farrah_fowler I’ll miss you more.
sheldon_cooper Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one.
amy_farrah_fowler If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…
leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
sheldon_cooper Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea.
leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
sheldon_cooper And it’s just the way you like it.
leonard_hofstadter Earl grey?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Honey?
sheldon_cooper Yes.
leonard_hofstadter Unsweetened almond…
sheldon_cooper Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.
leonard_hofstadter Sorry, thank you.
sheldon_cooper Well, what can we do to cheer you up?
leonard_hofstadter I really don’t know.
sheldon_cooper You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.
leonard_hofstadter Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh.
howard_wolowitz Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.
raj_koothrappali It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
howard_wolowitz Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.
howard_wolowitz Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it.
raj_koothrappali It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
howard_wolowitz Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
raj_koothrappali Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
howard_wolowitz It’s a tradition of my people. If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.
raj_koothrappali Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.
sheldon_cooper Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
leonard_hofstadter Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
sheldon_cooper Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
sheldon_cooper Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.
leonard_hofstadter I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got.
penny When was the last time you got a massage?
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.
penny Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?
penny Well, yeah.
amy_farrah_fowler Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny What are you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter I came here to apologize.
penny Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.
leonard_hofstadter Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you.
amy_farrah_fowler Nice to see you, too.
sheldon_cooper And that’s how you make effort look effortless.
penny All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t understand what you want.
penny I’m trying to figure it out.
sheldon_cooper You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.
amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?
sheldon_cooper Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.
howard_wolowitz So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,
raj_koothrappali Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.
howard_wolowitz Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.
bernadette_rostenkowski You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
raj_koothrappali Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed.
howard_wolowitz Bigger problems, I felt something pop.
sheldon_cooper There’s a cucumber in my water.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh-huh.
sheldon_cooper Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh.
leonard_hofstadter Hey.
penny Hey.
sheldon_cooper Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?
penny We’re not getting divorced.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.
penny Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um.
leonard_hofstadter Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule.
penny Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
leonard_hofstadter What do you say?
sheldon_cooper I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started.
penny Do you really think that’s funny?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.
sheldon_cooper If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.
penny Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.
leonard_hofstadter Does it really need to say that?
sheldon_cooper I did this for free, let me get a little something.
leonard_hofstadter Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it.
penny I think this all looks good.
leonard_hofstadter Me, too.
sheldon_cooper Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.
amy_farrah_fowler I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
sheldon_cooper Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
amy_farrah_fowler Right, right. Got it.
