bernadette_rostenkowski And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
penny Ooh, one gravy boat.
amy_farrah_fowler That’s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.
bernadette_rostenkowski In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.
penny One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.
amy_farrah_fowler When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
penny Ew, why?
amy_farrah_fowler ‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
bernadette_rostenkowski So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
amy_farrah_fowler Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don’t tell Sheldon. He’s still a flight risk.
bernadette_rostenkowski What about you, Penny?
penny What about me what?
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
penny Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.
bernadette_rostenkowski But do you think you’ll ever get married?
penny He’s a sweetie.
amy_farrah_fowler You’re not answering the question. Do you love him?
penny Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
bernadette_rostenkowski It doesn’t sound like it.
penny Well, I do.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you tell him that?
penny No, he’d just take it the wrong way.
amy_farrah_fowler What does that mean?
penny It means he is special and smart and nice and…
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you gonna break up with him?
penny No. Maybe. I don’t know.
bernadette_rostenkowski I had no idea you were unhappy.
penny That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.
penny Amy, you?
amy_farrah_fowler Can’t help ya, kid. Whenever I’m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.
raj_koothrappali Hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?
howard_wolowitz You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.
leonard_hofstadter So, is it everything you hoped it would be?
howard_wolowitz It’s better. I wake up every morning and I just can’t believe I’m on this incredible adventure.
dimitri Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?
howard_wolowitz Excuse me. I’m talking to my friends.
mike_massimino You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.
dimitri If you do good job, next time we give you brush.
howard_wolowitz Funny. We’re always giving each other a hard time up here. It’s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.
sheldon_cooper Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
leonard_hofstadter Go ahead.
sheldon_cooper 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over.
howard_wolowitz Yes, I read you, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Copy that. Over.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I am talking to a man in space. If you don’t have the then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
howard_wolowitz You’re out of your mind,Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper That’s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over.
mike_massimino Come on, scrub it up, Loops.
howard_wolowitz All right, all right. I gotta go. There’s a meteor shower.
mike_massimino You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.
howard_wolowitz Bye.
sheldon_cooper Over and out.
raj_koothrappali Bye, buddy!
stuart_bloom Hello.
raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart, come on in.
sheldon_cooper What are you doing here?
stuart_bloom Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you are not in charge.
sheldon_cooper That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
raj_koothrappali What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.
sheldon_cooper The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.
leonard_hofstadter It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz.
sheldon_cooper Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
stuart_bloom I can take them or leave them.
sheldon_cooper At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.
stuart_bloom Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
sheldon_cooper Well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets.
stuart_bloom Okay. Should we go?
sheldon_cooper Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.
stuart_bloom All right.
sheldon_cooper Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?
stuart_bloom I went to art school.
sheldon_cooper Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.
sheldon_cooper This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I like it.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
amy_farrah_fowler Just watch the movie.
sheldon_cooper It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.
amy_farrah_fowler There might be a reason for that.
sheldon_cooper Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
amy_farrah_fowler Penny said she’s not sure she wants to be Leonard’s girlfriend anymore.
sheldon_cooper Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
amy_farrah_fowler So?
sheldon_cooper So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?
amy_farrah_fowler It’s complicated.
sheldon_cooper String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?
amy_farrah_fowler She’s not sure how she feels.
sheldon_cooper How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.
amy_farrah_fowler Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.
sheldon_cooper Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?
amy_farrah_fowler Yes, please, Penny will kill me.
sheldon_cooper Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head.
stuart_bloom Raisinet?
sheldon_cooper Shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.
leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
sheldon_cooper I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
sheldon_cooper Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.
leonard_hofstadter I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people, Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you.
leonard_hofstadter Okay.
sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you.
leonard_hofstadter Why?
sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.
leonard_hofstadter I wish there were more.
sheldon_cooper Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.
leonard_hofstadter What is it?
sheldon_cooper I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
leonard_hofstadter Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
sheldon_cooper Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I think I understand.
sheldon_cooper You do?
leonard_hofstadter The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
sheldon_cooper That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
sheldon_cooper Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper Are you sleeping?
leonard_hofstadter I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?
sheldon_cooper Never mind. I still can’t tell you.
sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny?
penny Oh, my God. Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper You frightened me.
penny What are you doing in my bedroom?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it.
penny How did you even get in, you weirdo?
sheldon_cooper Yeah, really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it’s weird?
penny What do you want, Sheldon?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk.
penny Talk about what?
sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.
penny Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
penny Okay, go home, crazy man.
sheldon_cooper Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s North Korea, he’s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.
penny Okay, what did Amy tell you?
sheldon_cooper Oh, very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
penny Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
penny Of course not.
sheldon_cooper Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
penny Worst bedtime story ever.
sheldon_cooper My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
penny Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?
sheldon_cooper I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
penny Get out.
sheldon_cooper Penny?
penny What?
sheldon_cooper Please don’t hurt my friend.
penny That is the last thing I want to do.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
penny Get out.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello?
penny What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in?
amy_farrah_fowler Hang on, please. Hello?
amy_farrah_fowler I know. She’s yelling at me right now.
sheldon_cooper All right then, so we’re all on the same page. Yes.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie.
bernadette_rostenkowski There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?
howard_wolowitz Oh, it’s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.
bernadette_rostenkowski What’s wrong?
howard_wolowitz Nothing. Everything’s fine.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
howard_wolowitz The other astronauts are being mean to me.
bernadette_rostenkowski No, what are they doing?
howard_wolowitz Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Howie.
howard_wolowitz You can see it if you want. It’s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you stand up to them?
howard_wolowitz What am I supposed to say?
bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. Say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice.
howard_wolowitz Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.
bernadette_rostenkowski Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
howard_wolowitz No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
leonard_hofstadter Gelatinous Sphere.
raj_koothrappali Focused Locust.
stuart_bloom Temple of Yip.
sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
stuart_bloom All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
sheldon_cooper Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.
raj_koothrappali So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
stuart_bloom We’re gonna try to meet some girls.
raj_koothrappali ‘Cause that’s what we do.
stuart_bloom Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.
raj_koothrappali In case you didn’t follow that, I’m the coffee.
sheldon_cooper Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
leonard_hofstadter Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up.
leonard_hofstadter You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
stuart_bloom No, please don’t ruin this for me.
sheldon_cooper Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
leonard_hofstadter Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
sheldon_cooper But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.
leonard_hofstadter What’s your point?
sheldon_cooper Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
stuart_bloom I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.
leonard_hofstadter So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.
penny Really?
leonard_hofstadter Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream.
penny Mmm.
leonard_hofstadter I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
penny Uh-huh.
leonard_hofstadter You okay? You seem a little distracted.
penny Look, there’s something I need to tell you.
leonard_hofstadter Oh. Yeah, okay.
penny I don’t really know how to say this.
leonard_hofstadter Just say it.
penny Okay. Here goes.
leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm.
amy_farrah_fowler You slept with him?
penny I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, sure, you had no choice.
penny He looked at me like this.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog.
bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.
penny Look, it’s fine. We’re not getting married, okay? We’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis.
amy_farrah_fowler It’s so cute when she tries.
penny It’s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You’re amazing. I’m so lucky to have you in my life. Okay, stop it.
howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night’s sleep.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Howie.
howard_wolowitz What’s wrong? You look upset.
bernadette_rostenkowski Nope, this is my proud face.
