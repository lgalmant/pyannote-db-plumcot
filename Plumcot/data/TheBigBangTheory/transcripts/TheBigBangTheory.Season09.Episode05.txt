leonard_hofstadter Hey, ready for lunch?
howard_wolowitz Oh, one sec.
sheldon_cooper Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
howard_wolowitz No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.
leonard_hofstadter That’ll teach her to care about your health.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.
raj_koothrappali When was the last actual exercise you got?
howard_wolowitz The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.
sheldon_cooper According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.
raj_koothrappali Are you?
sheldon_cooper Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.
leonard_hofstadter It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
howard_wolowitz You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.
leonard_hofstadter Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.
sheldon_cooper Had me at flag, lost me at football.
penny Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
leonard_hofstadter What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
penny Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
leonard_hofstadter I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
leonard_hofstadter It’s indoors, so no sunscreen.
sheldon_cooper No throwing, no catching, no running.
leonard_hofstadter No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
sheldon_cooper Or worse, up.
leonard_hofstadter Preach.
sheldon_cooper And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.
leonard_hofstadter What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
sheldon_cooper Ah, touché.
stuart_bloom Thanks for coming by.
bernadette_rostenkowski Sure. So how can we help?
stuart_bloom Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can’t get ’em in here.
penny All right, well, what have you tried so far?
stuart_bloom Uh, I’ve, I’ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.
penny Really? In a comic book store?
stuart_bloom Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.
stuart_bloom Well, you don’t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.
raj_koothrappali I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
leonard_hofstadter I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
sheldon_cooper Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have.
raj_koothrappali We can still be swashers.
howard_wolowitz Well said, Puss.
barry_kripke Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn’t a joke. I hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike Star Wars.
leonard_hofstadter That’s not why we’re here.
raj_koothrappali Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.
howard_wolowitz And maybe a little Princess Bride.
raj_koothrappali Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.
barry_kripke Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.
sheldon_cooper We’re not afraid of physical activity.
howard_wolowitz Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
barry_kripke Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.
sheldon_cooper Oh, dear.
barry_kripke What’s wong, Cooper?
sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.
howard_wolowitz When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
sheldon_cooper Right. Always right.
howard_wolowitz He’s a righty.
barry_kripke Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.
howard_wolowitz Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.
barry_kripke The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.
leonard_hofstadter This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.
barry_kripke Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Barry?
barry_kripke Yes.
sheldon_cooper When can I stab one of my friends?
barry_kripke In fencing, we don’t call it a stab. We call it a touch.
sheldon_cooper Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.
barry_kripke Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.
amy_farrah_fowler Have you thought about advertising directly to females?
stuart_bloom Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid.
penny Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?
stuart_bloom Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it.
penny All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.
stuart_bloom See? Negative.
barry_kripke With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.
raj_koothrappali Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
sheldon_cooper En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.
howard_wolowitz My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
raj_koothrappali My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
howard_wolowitz I thought you were Puss in Boots.
raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
sheldon_cooper I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
leonard_hofstadter What?
sheldon_cooper You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
leonard_hofstadter When was your honour insulted?
sheldon_cooper My last physical.
leonard_hofstadter Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.
raj_koothrappali My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
howard_wolowitz My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
sheldon_cooper Ah, this is fun.
leonard_hofstadter Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.
barry_kripke What’s going on with Amy?
sheldon_cooper Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.
barry_kripke Weawwy? Good to know.
sheldon_cooper Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?
leonard_hofstadter Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.
sheldon_cooper Well, that’s unacceptable.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.
sheldon_cooper Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.
leonard_hofstadter Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.
sheldon_cooper You really think so?
leonard_hofstadter Of course. She deserves to be happy.
sheldon_cooper How dare you.
leonard_hofstadter Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.
sheldon_cooper Barry, a word?
leonard_hofstadter And now the crazy version of what I just said.
sheldon_cooper If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.
barry_kripke And how are you gonna do that?
sheldon_cooper By challenging you to a duel.
barry_kripke You’ve had one wesson. I’ll destwoy you.
sheldon_cooper That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.
leonard_hofstadter Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.
stuart_bloom All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem.
penny Yeah.
bernadette_rostenkowski You are.
amy_farrah_fowler You can say it.
stuart_bloom Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.
penny Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.
stuart_bloom Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.
amy_farrah_fowler Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
stuart_bloom It was a joke.
bernadette_rostenkowski Was it?
stuart_bloom No, I’m still doing it.
penny Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
stuart_bloom I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself.
bernadette_rostenkowski That really happened?
stuart_bloom I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get.
amy_farrah_fowler Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
stuart_bloom Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you.
amy_farrah_fowler Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.
leonard_hofstadter I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.
sheldon_cooper Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.
leonard_hofstadter If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.
howard_wolowitz Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.
sheldon_cooper That’s ridiculous.
raj_koothrappali Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.
sheldon_cooper True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.
leonard_hofstadter Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
sheldon_cooper There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.
raj_koothrappali Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.
sheldon_cooper You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
raj_koothrappali How many sips of that beer did he have?
leonard_hofstadter Three.
howard_wolowitz Oh, boy.
sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 What?
sheldon_cooper It’s a Pokémon reference.
woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 I don’t know what that means.
sheldon_cooper Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?
older_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 I’m married, and I’m her grandmother.
sheldon_cooper Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.
bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
penny Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.
penny And sometimes we marry them anyway.
amy_farrah_fowler Huh. Well, this is weird.
penny What?
amy_farrah_fowler Barry Kripke just asked me out.
bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.
penny I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
bernadette_rostenkowski What did he say?
amy_farrah_fowler Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.
penny Well, what are you gonna do?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.
bernadette_rostenkowski What can it hurt?
amy_farrah_fowler Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.
bernadette_rostenkowski You mean, not a scientist?
penny I think she means not a weirdo.
bernadette_rostenkowski Are you attracted to him?
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know.
penny All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?
amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.
sheldon_cooper I smell funny. I taste salty.
leonard_hofstadter You’re just sweaty from exercise.
sheldon_cooper And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
leonard_hofstadter I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
leonard_hofstadter We should let you guys talk.
bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
sheldon_cooper You don’t have to leave.
leonard_hofstadter Look at me go.
amy_farrah_fowler Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.
bernadette_rostenkowski Walk.
amy_farrah_fowler How have you been?
sheldon_cooper I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.
amy_farrah_fowler How’d that go?
sheldon_cooper It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
amy_farrah_fowler Well, actually, he, he already did.
sheldon_cooper Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.
amy_farrah_fowler I said no.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
amy_farrah_fowler I didn’t know you were interested in dating.
sheldon_cooper I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good.
sheldon_cooper Thanks. And I taste good too.
bernadette_rostenkowski Howie?
howard_wolowitz What’s up?
bernadette_rostenkowski Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
