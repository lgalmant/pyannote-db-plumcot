penny Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?
bernadette Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
emily Well, Batman’s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.
penny No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.
leonard What is happening?
howard I don’t know.
raj But it’s beautiful.
penny And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
emily Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.
penny Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.
bernadette We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
penny Oh, I love me some Leo.
leonard And it’s gone.
sheldon Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.
leonard Good for you.
sheldon My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.
howard Glad to hear it.
sheldon I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
raj Yay.
sheldon Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.
penny You really don’t know why?
sheldon No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
leonard Let me refresh your memory.
sheldon Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.
penny Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.
sheldon Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.
bernadette I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
sheldon I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke.
howard Hey, she came all the way here…
bernadette You’re gonna want to take these with food.
raj Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
sheldon She’s a dermatologist.
emily I went to medical school.
sheldon Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.
leonard All right, here you go.
sheldon Leonard, I’m dying.
leonard You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.
sheldon I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.
sheldon I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?
amy Hi, Sheldon.
sheldon Hello.
amy Are you feeling any better?
sheldon Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.
amy Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.
sheldon You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?
amy Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.
sheldon I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?
amy Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.
sheldon You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
amy No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting.
sheldon You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
amy Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye.
raj Hey, Stuart.
stuart Hey. Where’s Sheldon? Still sick?
leonard No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break.
stuart Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.
howard He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally.
stuart Oh, I’m on so many antidepressants, I couldn’t if I wanted to.
raj I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
leonard I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
howard You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.
raj Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in.
howard We should all take a trip or something.
leonard Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.
howard Bernie would love that.
raj Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.
leonard That sounds really fun.
raj Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.
leonard No.
howard No.
leonard No.
howard No.
leonard So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.
penny Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?
leonard Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay.
penny Well, I’m in. When are we going?
leonard This weekend.
sheldon Oh, where are we going?
leonard Well, Vegas, but…
sheldon Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.
leonard That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited.
sheldon Well, now, well, that’s hurtful.
penny Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there.
sheldon I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
leonard Not this time.
sheldon Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.
leonard He’s coming, too.
sheldon Well, then Raj and I will…
leonard Nope.
sheldon Very well. Stuart.
leonard Oh, great. Do that.
sheldon Ugh. Stuart.
amy Hi, Sheldon. What’s new?
sheldon Our friends are jerks, and I’m mad at all of them.
amy I said what’s new, but sure.
sheldon Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?
amy Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
sheldon You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
amy Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
sheldon I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
amy Who else’s side could you have been on?
sheldon I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
amy Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.
sheldon Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.
amy Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on.
sheldon I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.
amy Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
sheldon Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.
amy Glad I could help.
sheldon Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
amy I feel so, so bad.
sheldon Hey, we’re both great at this.
sheldon Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it.
leonard Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance.
sheldon Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry.
leonard Thank you. I appreciate that.
sheldon I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
leonard Appreciate that, too.
sheldon Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?
leonard You’re still not coming.
sheldon What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong.
leonard Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come.
sheldon Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?
leonard Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come.
sheldon Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
leonard Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.
sheldon My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?
sheldon Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.
howard Wow. I’m impressed.
sheldon No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute.
howard Apology accepted.
bernadette Forgiven, forgiven.
sheldon All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.
howard Sheldon Cooper apologized to me
bernadette And he made it all better.
sheldon All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.
penny Can this wait?
sheldon I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
penny Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.
sheldon Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
penny Leonard.
sheldon You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.
stuart Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
sheldon And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
stuart What trip to Las Vegas?
sheldon The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
stuart Of course, I wasn’t invited.
sheldon That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?
sheldon Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.
raj Of course I do.
sheldon And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.
emily Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
sheldon Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
raj Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
emily Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.
raj Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it.
emily Why are you defending him?
sheldon I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
emily Well, I don’t accept your apology.
raj What are you doing?
emily It’s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.
raj Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop.
emily Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.
raj No, come on, please don’t leave.
sheldon Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…
emily Don’t worry, you’re good.
sheldon I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more.
penny So, was the fight really bad?
sheldon No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
leonard You think they’ll still go on the trip?
sheldon All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…
leonard They’re not going on the trip.
penny No.
raj What is wrong with you?
sheldon Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.
raj You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
sheldon That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.
all No.
penny Is she okay?
raj Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.
howard Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option.
sheldon Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.
raj That’s very mature of you.
sheldon Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.
penny And there’s your next T-shirt.
howard Ooh, check out the stripper pole.
bernadette You know what that means.
leonard That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
raj You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.
bernadette This is so cool.
penny Here’s some champagne.
leonard Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…
sheldon Aha.
leonard What are you doing?
sheldon My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.
penny You couldn’t give us just one weekend?
stuart I told him this was a bad idea.
leonard What do we do, kick them off?
penny If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
sheldon Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.
raj Oh, God.
sheldon Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
raj You know, Sheldon…
emily Shh, let him finish.
sheldon So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry.
emily Thank you.
sheldon Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.
emily Oh, it’s okay, Sheldon. Come with us.
sheldon Oh, that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go, Stuart.
stuart But I want to stay.
sheldon Stuart, now.
emily You know, I know he’s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.
penny And now you see the problem.
leonard Come on, you pain in the ass.
sheldon That’s me. Bye, Stuart.
stuart Wait. I’m a pain in the ass, too.
sheldon Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
emily At the moment? No, not really.
penny Shake it, baby.
bernadette Ooh, work that thing.
