leonard_hofstadter Okay, we’ve got power to the laser.
sheldon_cooper I should’ve brought an umbrella.
leonard_hofstadter What for? It’s not going to rain.
sheldon_cooper I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
howard_wolowitz That’s a bazinga, right?
sheldon_cooper One of my best, don’t you think?
leonard_hofstadter Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.
howard_wolowitz You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows.
raj_koothrappali It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy.
sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?
leonard_hofstadter Relax, it’s just a dirty sock.
sheldon_cooper How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
sheldon_cooper Not my world.
leonard_hofstadter Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
sheldon_cooper I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
raj_koothrappali Why don’t you ask her to come up?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…
howard_wolowitz She dumped you?
leonard_hofstadter She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
sheldon_cooper I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
howard_wolowitz Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.
leonard_hofstadter Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
howard_wolowitz If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now.
raj_koothrappali Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.
penny Oh, hi. What’s going on?
leonard_hofstadter We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
penny I’m sorry, what?
leonard_hofstadter It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
man_in_pennys_apartment#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 That makes no sense.
penny Um…
man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There’s no gravity.
penny Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.
zack_johnson Hey.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time.
penny Yeah, maybe.
zack_johnson Hey, I want to see this laser thing.
penny Oh, but what about the party?
zack_johnson It’s a surprise party, doesn’t matter when we get there.
penny Oh, right.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?
zack_johnson My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.
leonard_hofstadter Your company?
zack_johnson Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.
leonard_hofstadter So, menus.
zack_johnson I know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them.
howard_wolowitz Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.
penny Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.
zack_johnson Hey.
sheldon_cooper Hello.
zack_johnson Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’.
sheldon_cooper Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.
zack_johnson Well, mission accomplished.
leonard_hofstadter Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
penny Oh! That’s very cool.
zack_johnson One question. How can you be sure it won’t blow up?
leonard_hofstadter The laser?
zack_johnson The moon.
sheldon_cooper See, now this is a man for Penny.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, that’s a great question, Zack.
sheldon_cooper No, it’s not.
penny Sheldon! Play nice.
sheldon_cooper Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.
zack_johnson Smart.
leonard_hofstadter Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
zack_johnson Naked.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.
zack_johnson Cool, it’s gonna be in 3-D?
howard_wolowitz Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
sheldon_cooper Make it so.
howard_wolowitz There it is. There’s the spike!
leonard_hofstadter 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
zack_johnson That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?
leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
zack_johnson What species is that?
sheldon_cooper I was wrong. Penny can do better.
penny Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun.
zack_johnson Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?
penny No, just keep walking.
sheldon_cooper He must be very skilled at coitus.
raj_koothrappali I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.
howard_wolowitz Horse.
raj_koothrappali What?
howard_wolowitz The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.
raj_koothrappali That’s disgusting, dude.
howard_wolowitz No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.
leonard_hofstadter No, thanks.
howard_wolowitz You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
leonard_hofstadter Have they found a match for you?
howard_wolowitz Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.
sheldon_cooper I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
leonard_hofstadter Why not?
sheldon_cooper All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to.
leonard_hofstadter I’ll help you.
sheldon_cooper Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.
raj_koothrappali You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
howard_wolowitz Yeah, right.
raj_koothrappali No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.
howard_wolowitz He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
raj_koothrappali Okay, we’ll call that plan B.
leonard_hofstadter Coming!
penny Damn you, you rat bastard.
leonard_hofstadter Are you drunk?
penny Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!
leonard_hofstadter How did I ruin him?
penny ‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid.
leonard_hofstadter Come on, he wasn’t that stupid.
penny Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!
leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah, he’s stupid.
penny He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
leonard_hofstadter How is that my fault?
penny You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.
leonard_hofstadter Where are we going?
penny We’re gonna have sex.
leonard_hofstadter Why? I mean, okay.
sheldon_cooper What’s going on?
penny Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud.
sheldon_cooper Oh! Not this again.
sheldon_cooper In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.
penny What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?
sheldon_cooper When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?
penny Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry.
sheldon_cooper FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
penny Yeah, sorry about that.
sheldon_cooper As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.
penny Oh, God.
sheldon_cooper Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter How many times have I asked you not to do that?
sheldon_cooper Counting this instance? 317.
leonard_hofstadter Where’s Penny?
sheldon_cooper She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
leonard_hofstadter I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
sheldon_cooper Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
leonard_hofstadter I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
sheldon_cooper I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
penny Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.
leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?
penny Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
leonard_hofstadter Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
penny Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me.
leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
penny Leonard, last night was a mistake.
leonard_hofstadter When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?
penny Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?
leonard_hofstadter No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
penny Oh, God!
leonard_hofstadter So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?
penny Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?
leonard_hofstadter How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
mrs_gunderson Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?
raj_koothrappali Holy crap.
howard_wolowitz What?
raj_koothrappali We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
howard_wolowitz Excuse me?
raj_koothrappali The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
howard_wolowitz You’re kidding. An actual woman?
raj_koothrappali Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.
howard_wolowitz Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman.
raj_koothrappali Since when?
howard_wolowitz I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.
leonard_hofstadter Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?
raj_koothrappali Do you know what he’s talking about?
howard_wolowitz Nope. Why don’t you ask him?
raj_koothrappali Leonard, what are you talking about?
leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it.
raj_koothrappali That was a lousy suggestion.
howard_wolowitz Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…
leonard_hofstadter If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. I can’t do it.
leslie_winkle Hello?
leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.
leslie_winkle Leonard Hofstadter. What’re you doing here?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, I know! It’s been a while!
leslie_winkle Yeah, 18 months.
leonard_hofstadter Right. Right. So how you doing?
leslie_winkle Fine. You?
leonard_hofstadter Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?
leslie_winkle Yeah.
leonard_hofstadter Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?
leslie_winkle What happened? Blondie dumped you?
leonard_hofstadter She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
leslie_winkle Right.
leonard_hofstadter Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.
leslie_winkle Uh-huh.
leonard_hofstadter So, what do you say?
leslie_winkle Let me think about it.
leonard_hofstadter She’s not coming back.
raj_koothrappali Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
howard_wolowitz Not us. Him.
raj_koothrappali Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her.
howard_wolowitz Well, him about to find out about her.
raj_koothrappali Really? Us gonna tell him?
sheldon_cooper Who’s going to tell whom about what?
howard_wolowitz Sheldon. Hey.
raj_koothrappali Hi.
sheldon_cooper Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
howard_wolowitz Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?
sheldon_cooper Be more specific.
howard_wolowitz Four thirty.
sheldon_cooper That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
howard_wolowitz What?
sheldon_cooper It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
raj_koothrappali Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
sheldon_cooper Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
howard_wolowitz Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?
sheldon_cooper I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
raj_koothrappali But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
sheldon_cooper Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
howard_wolowitz And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”
raj_koothrappali Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.
howard_wolowitz Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?
sheldon_cooper Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.
raj_koothrappali Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
sheldon_cooper He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
howard_wolowitz Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.
sheldon_cooper I don’t drink coffee.
howard_wolowitz All right, you can have a hot chocolate.
sheldon_cooper As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
howard_wolowitz Why?
sheldon_cooper What’s life without whimsy?
howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m out.
raj_koothrappali Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
sheldon_cooper You’re bluffing.
raj_koothrappali Are you willing to risk it?
sheldon_cooper Curse you.
leonard_hofstadter Thirty feet.
penny Oh. Hey, Leonard.
leonard_hofstadter I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!
penny Are you drunk?
leonard_hofstadter Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!
penny Are you out of your mind?!
leonard_hofstadter I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
sheldon_cooper In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?
raj_koothrappali You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
sheldon_cooper Haughty derision it is.
amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper.
sheldon_cooper Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
amy_farrah_fowler If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
sheldon_cooper Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
amy_farrah_fowler I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
sheldon_cooper Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
amy_farrah_fowler Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
sheldon_cooper May I buy you a beverage?
amy_farrah_fowler Tepid water, please.
howard_wolowitz Good God, what have we done?
