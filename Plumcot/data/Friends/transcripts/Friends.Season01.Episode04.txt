dr_ross_geller Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
chandler_bing Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
rachel_green See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
all@ Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
monica_geller Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
joey_tribbiani Probably kill myself!
monica_geller .Excuse me?
joey_tribbiani Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
dr_ross_geller Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
joey_tribbiani You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
monica_geller How does she do that?
dr_ross_geller I cannot sleep in a public place.
monica_geller Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
phoebe_buffay Oh! What what what!..Hi.
dr_ross_geller It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
monica_geller What's going on with you?
phoebe_buffay I got no sleep last night!
dr_ross_geller Why?
phoebe_buffay My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
monica_geller Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
phoebe_buffay Thanks.
joey_tribbiani ..Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.

chandler_bing Happy birthday, pal!
joey_tribbiani We love you, man.
dr_ross_geller Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
joey_tribbiani So?
dr_ross_geller So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
chandler_bing Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
monica_geller Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
dr_ross_geller Ohhh.
joey_tribbiani What's wrong with the twentieth?
chandler_bing Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
dr_ross_geller Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
joey_tribbiani The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
chandler_bing C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?

chandler_bing You got it.
rachel_green Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
phoebe_buffay I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
monica_geller Wow, you worked in a mine?
phoebe_buffay I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
rachel_green God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally--not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.

phoebe_buffay Look, look, I have elbows!
chandler_bing ..Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
joey_tribbiani Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
chandler_bing We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
dr_ross_geller Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.

rachel_green Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
leslie Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
monica_geller Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
rachel_green What's that?
monica_geller Weeeell, it's rum, and-
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
phoebe_buffay Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
monica_geller Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
rachel_green Oh, God, ask them what they want.
monica_geller Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
rachel_green But I haven't used my card in weeks!
monica_geller That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
rachel_green They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
monica_geller Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
rachel_green Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
dr_ross_geller Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
chandler_bing What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
dr_ross_geller No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
joey_tribbiani C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
monica_geller You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
rachel_green Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
phoebe_buffay You are just like Jack.
rachel_green ..Jack from downstairs?
phoebe_buffay No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
monica_geller Ah, the other Jack.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
rachel_green Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
phoebe_buffay Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
rachel_green But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
phoebe_buffay Floopy?
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
phoebe_buffay Oh, like that's a word.
rachel_green Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
monica_geller ..Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
rachel_green Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?

Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
monica_geller Light still out?

monica_geller Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
dr_ross_geller I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
chandler_bing Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
joey_tribbiani He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
dr_ross_geller Look, it's just a little more complicated...
chandler_bing Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
dr_ross_geller Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
chandler_bing Then what?
dr_ross_geller My first time with Carol was...
joey_tribbiani What?
