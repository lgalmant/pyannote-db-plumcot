joey_tribbiani Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
rachel_green We weren't doing anything!
joey_tribbiani Rach, he just saw us.
rachel_green Shhh.
joey_tribbiani But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
rachel_green No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
joey_tribbiani Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
rachel_green Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
joey_tribbiani Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
rachel_green We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but it did happen, so...
joey_tribbiani Ross?
rachel_green Ross? Can we just close the door?
rachel_green Ross, say something. Anything.
dr_ross_geller So you two are..?
joey_tribbiani@rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller And have you. ed?
joey_tribbiani No, no, no!
rachel_green No, no, no!
dr_ross_geller But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
joey_tribbiani Probably.
joey_tribbiani No, no!
rachel_green Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
dr_ross_geller I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
rachel_green No, but you know what I mean.
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
joey_tribbiani Really?
dr_ross_geller Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
joey_tribbiani Ross..
dr_ross_geller It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
rachel_green Calm ourselves?
dr_ross_geller No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
joey_tribbiani Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
dr_ross_geller Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
joey_tribbiani I do like fajitas.
monica_geller God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
chandler_bing There's a hair in my coffee.
phoebe_buffay Hey guys!
monica_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
chandler_bing You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
monica_geller That's sweet. Drink your hair.
phoebe_buffay Hey, what's all this stuff?
monica_geller Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
monica_geller That's not really how it works.
phoebe_buffay Oh, how does it work?
monica_geller I don't know!
phoebe_buffay Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
monica_geller Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
frank_buffay_jr Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
frank_buffay_jr That's not what we talked about!!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
frank_buffay_jr Hey.
phoebe_buffay Good to see you.
frank_buffay_jr Good to see you, too.
monica_geller Hi Frank.
frank_buffay_jr Hi, how you doin'?
monica_geller Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
monica_geller Which one is which again?
frank_buffay_jr Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
monica_geller "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
joey_tribbiani Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
rachel_green Well, what would we be doing?
joey_tribbiani I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
rachel_green Feel me up?
joey_tribbiani In a carriage!
joey_tribbiani Hey, Charlie!
rachel_green Hey.
charlie_wheeler Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
rachel_green Oh, you bet.
joey_tribbiani So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
charlie_wheeler Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Oh, thanks.
charlie_wheeler And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
dr_ross_geller I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
rachel_green Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
dr_ross_geller Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
joey_tribbiani Uh, actually, that's..
dr_ross_geller Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
charlie_wheeler Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
dr_ross_geller What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
joey_tribbiani Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
dr_ross_geller You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
phoebe_buffay Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
phoebe_buffay Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
frank_buffay_jr I haven't slept in four years!
phoebe_buffay That's a, that's a long time.
frank_buffay_jr You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
frank_buffay_jr Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
phoebe_buffay What?
frank_buffay_jr No, I can't.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
frank_buffay_jr Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
phoebe_buffay What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
monica_geller Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
colleen Oh, please, we're happy to help.
bill We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
chandler_bing So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
chandler_bing I mean, you have a lovely home.
monica_geller Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
colleen Well, actually, I think this might help.
colleen It's pretty much all the information you need.
monica_geller Oh my god!
colleen Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
monica_geller Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
bill I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
chandler_bing That's great. Can I see the book?
chandler_bing You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
monica_geller It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
colleen The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
colleen I would have told him to do it too.
monica_geller Can I adopt you?
chandler_bing Hey, you must be Owen.
owen Yeah.
chandler_bing I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
owen You were?
chandler_bing Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
owen Huh?
chandler_bing You know how to use a compass?
owen I have a badge in it.
chandler_bing You do? That's fantastic!
owen You wanna see it?
chandler_bing I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
owen What?!?
chandler_bing What?
owen I'm adopted?
chandler_bing I got nothing.
dr_ross_geller The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
rachel_green Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
dr_ross_geller Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
joey_tribbiani Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
dr_ross_geller I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
rachel_green No awareness.
dr_ross_geller We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
dr_ross_geller My fajitas!!
rachel_green Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
charlie_wheeler Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
charlie_wheeler Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
dr_ross_geller Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
rachel_green Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
dr_ross_geller That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
phoebe_buffay Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
frank_buffay_jr No, of course we're not.
phoebe_buffay Insane.
frank_buffay_jr I know.
phoebe_buffay Alice would never go for it, right?
frank_buffay_jr Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
phoebe_buffay Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
frank_buffay_jr Huh.
phoebe_buffay Frank Jr.Jr.?
frank_buffay_jr Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
frank_buffay_jr What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
phoebe_buffay Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
frank_buffay_jr Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
phoebe_buffay Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
frank_buffay_jr Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
phoebe_buffay Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
frank_buffay_jr Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
frank_buffay_jr How about tomorrow?
phoebe_buffay Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
frank_buffay_jr You'd do that for us?
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
frank_buffay_jr Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
chandler_bing Where are Bill and Colleen?
monica_geller They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
chandler_bing We have to leave!!
monica_geller Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
chandler_bing I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
monica_geller Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
colleen Hey.
bill Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
colleen I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
chandler_bing But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
owen I'm adopted?!
chandler_bing See? Intuitive!
bill What? Where did you hear that?
owen He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
chandler_bing Which technically now you should give back!
colleen You told him he's adopted?
chandler_bing I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
owen He isn't?!
chandler_bing We have to get out of here, baby!
dr_ross_geller Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
rachel_green Ooy.
dr_ross_geller And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
rachel_green Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
dr_ross_geller O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
joey_tribbiani Dude, are you okay?
dr_ross_geller Totally.
rachel_green Ross, you don't seem okay.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
charlie_wheeler Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
dr_ross_geller No!
charlie_wheeler I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
dr_ross_geller Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
charlie_wheeler You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
dr_ross_geller Okay.
charlie_wheeler Alright.
charlie_wheeler God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
rachel_green Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
charlie_wheeler Bye.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
rachel_green You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
rachel_green No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
dr_ross_geller I don't even know what that's for.
joey_tribbiani You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
rachel_green Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
rachel_green Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
joey_tribbiani It doesn't look good, does it?
joey_tribbiani Morning. Here you go.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller So you took off my pants and shoes?
joey_tribbiani No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
dr_ross_geller What do you mean?
joey_tribbiani Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
dr_ross_geller Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
joey_tribbiani It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
joey_tribbiani That's what I hear, yeah.
dr_ross_geller This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
joey_tribbiani Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
dr_ross_geller Joey.
joey_tribbiani I'm crazy about her.
dr_ross_geller And she feels the same way?
joey_tribbiani I think so.
dr_ross_geller Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
dr_ross_geller No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm sure.
joey_tribbiani And we're okay?
monica_geller Hey, Phoebs
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
chandler_bing Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Still, he had to find out sometime.
chandler_bing Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
chandler_bing I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
