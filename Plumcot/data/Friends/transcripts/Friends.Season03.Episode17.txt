joey_tribbiani Can I see the comics?
chandler_bing This is the New York Times.
joey_tribbiani Okay, may I see the comics?
monica_geller Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
chandler_bing We are. He's meeting us here.
monica_geller No! Rachel is meeting us here.
phoebe_buffay Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
phoebe_buffay Why? What happened now?
joey_tribbiani Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
chandler_bing Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
joey_tribbiani Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
phoebe_buffay Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
joey_tribbiani Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
phoebe_buffay Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
chandler_bing Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
phoebe_buffay Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
joey_tribbiani I had the same dream!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I had the opposite dream.
chandler_bing Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
monica_geller It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
monica_geller Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Let's get the show on it!
rachel_green Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
monica_geller Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
rachel_green Closer than here?
phoebe_buffay Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
rachel_green Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
phoebe_buffay Okay, your highness.
phoebe_buffay Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!

rachel_green Ohh!
monica_geller We're sorry honey.
rachel_green Oh, it's okay.
joey_tribbiani Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
rachel_green And heels.
joey_tribbiani Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
rachel_green No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah.
monica_geller Very bad.
phoebe_buffay Chandler what are you doing?!
monica_geller Chandler!!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani You're smoking again?!
chandler_bing Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
phoebe_buffay Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
chandler_bing Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
monica_geller Weren't you nine?!
chandler_bing Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
chandler_bing Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
phoebe_buffay Him? Him, Ross?
chandler_bing Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
rachel_green Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
all@ Absolutely, yeah!
rachel_green Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
chandler_bing Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
joey_tribbiani Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
phoebe_buffay Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
dr_ross_geller Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
chandler_bing Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
dr_ross_geller Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
joey_tribbiani It'll be great for next weekend.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, this weekend guys!
joey_tribbiani It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
phoebe_buffay Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
dr_ross_geller So, for the whole weekend?
monica_geller We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
phoebe_buffay Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
joey_tribbiani Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
monica_geller Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
dr_ross_geller What a pity stay?
monica_geller No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
dr_ross_geller Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
chandler_bing Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
joey_tribbiani Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
monica_geller Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
chandler_bing Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
joey_tribbiani What? Mine aren't tinted.
phoebe_buffay Chandler!!
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay What does the sign say?
chandler_bing Beam me up Jesus.

chandler_bing Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Ow!
phoebe_buffay Aren't you gonna go?
rachel_green No. Thank you.
monica_geller No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
rachel_green Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
phoebe_buffay No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
chandler_bing Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!

joey_tribbiani Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
chandler_bing Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
monica_geller So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
joey_tribbiani Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green What?!
joey_tribbiani Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
monica_geller Please!!
joey_tribbiani Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
the_girls#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode17 No, not getting my bra!
joey_tribbiani If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
phoebe_buffay Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
monica_geller These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
rachel_green What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
monica_geller All right then, your bra would still be big.
rachel_green No, I stuff outside the bra.
chandler_bing Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
phoebe_buffay All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
rachel_green Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
chandler_bing Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
phoebe_buffay Okay, there.
joey_tribbiani Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
chandler_bing Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
joey_tribbiani And there you go!
all@ Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
monica_geller Chandler!!
chandler_bing At least let me smoke it to the good part.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Oh, no!
rachel_green What, what's it, what's going on?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, this has happened before.
rachel_green So you know how to fix it?
phoebe_buffay Yep. Put more gas in.
carol_willick Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
carol_willick Hey, what are you doing here?
dr_ross_geller Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M'A'S'H and half the hostages coming home?
carol_willick Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
dr_ross_geller Where's Ben?
carol_willick He's sleeping.
dr_ross_geller Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
carol_willick Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
dr_ross_geller Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
carol_willick It's not that kind of anniversary.
dr_ross_geller Ah! Oh.
carol_willick Sooo!! Anyway...
dr_ross_geller Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
carol_willick Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well.
carol_willick Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, I'd love that.
carol_willick Oh, great! Me too.
dr_ross_geller I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
phoebe_buffay Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
rachel_green Great!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, what town are we near?
monica_geller Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
phoebe_buffay Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
rachel_green Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
phoebe_buffay Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
rachel_green I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
rachel_green Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
monica_geller Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
rachel_green No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
phoebe_buffay But if...
rachel_green No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
phoebe_buffay Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
monica_geller So the going for help went well?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
chandler_bing I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
monica_geller Then why are you smoking?
chandler_bing Well it's very unsettling.
dr_ross_geller ...right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
carol_willick Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
dr_ross_geller 717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
carol_willick No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
phoebe_buffay Ross, thank God.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
phoebe_buffay I ate a bug.
monica_geller Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
phoebe_buffay Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
dr_ross_geller Oh, now you want a favour?
phoebe_buffay Yes, please.
dr_ross_geller Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
carol_willick Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
dr_ross_geller No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
carol_willick Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
dr_ross_geller No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
carol_willick Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you're right.
carol_willick Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
dr_ross_geller We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
carol_willick You slept with another woman?
dr_ross_geller Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
joey_tribbiani Okay, done.
monica_geller What's 'pleh'?
joey_tribbiani That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
monica_geller Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
rachel_green Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey!!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
rachel_green What is he doing here?!
dr_ross_geller He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
all@ No! Come on!
rachel_green All right!! Fine! Fine.
joey_tribbiani Arrrghh!!
chandler_bing Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
phoebe_buffay You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
chandler_bing Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
joey_tribbiani Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
monica_geller I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
rachel_green Ask me what?
monica_geller Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
rachel_green You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
dr_ross_geller Excuse me?
chandler_bing It's horrible.
dr_ross_geller Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
rachel_green Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.

rachel_green All right, let's go!
dr_ross_geller You're welcome.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
dr_ross_geller We were on a break!
rachel_green Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller I don't know.
dr_ross_geller That's what you said last night.
monica_geller What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green Really Joey?
joey_tribbiani What?
phoebe_buffay Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
rachel_green No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
dr_ross_geller Obviously not to Joey.
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
chandler_bing Guys, guys, guess who I am?!

You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller I can.
