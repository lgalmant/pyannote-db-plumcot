chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller So how was Joan?
chandler_bing I broke up with her.
chandler_bing They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
rachel_green Come on, they were not that huge.
chandler_bing I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
monica_geller How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
joey_tribbiani Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
chandler_bing You or me?
dr_ross_geller I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
joey_tribbiani You guys are messin' with me, right?
all@ Yeah.
joey_tribbiani That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
phoebe_buffay You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
chandler_bing Maureen Rosilla.
dr_ross_geller Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
monica_geller Hello, Mr. Heckles.
mr_heckles You're doing it again.
monica_geller We're not doing anything.
mr_heckles You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
rachel_green You don't have birds.
mr_heckles I could have birds.
monica_geller Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
mr_heckles Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
rachel_green All right, bye-bye.
chandler_bing Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
dr_ross_geller We'll give you Janice.
phoebe_buffay I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
rachel_green "Oh, my, god."
joey_tribbiani "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
monica_geller Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
rachel_green We won. We won!
monica_geller Mr. Heckles.
rachel_green How did this happen?
mr_treeger He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
monica_geller That's terrible.
mr_treeger I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS
mr_treeger You never know.
phoebe_buffay Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
chandler_bing Ok, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
joey_tribbiani Such as?
phoebe_buffay Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
dr_ross_geller Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
phoebe_buffay Nah. Not really.
dr_ross_geller You don't believe in evolution?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
dr_ross_geller Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I just don't buy it.
dr_ross_geller Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
phoebe_buffay Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
dr_ross_geller You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
phoebe_buffay Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
chandler_bing Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
mr_treeger There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
monica_geller What can we do for you?
buddy_doyle All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
monica_geller Well, what about his family?
buddy_doyle He didn't have any.
rachel_green Ok, so let's talk money.
buddy_doyle All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
monica_geller I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
rachel_green Have you ever seen so much crap?
chandler_bing Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
joey_tribbiani Check this out. Can I have this?
dr_ross_geller How can you not believe in evolution?
phoebe_buffay Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
phoebe_buffay Really? You can actually see it?
dr_ross_geller You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
phoebe_buffay See, I didn't know that.
dr_ross_geller Well, there you go.
phoebe_buffay Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
chandler_bing Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
joey_tribbiani Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
chandler_bing April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
rachel_green Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
monica_geller Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
rachel_green What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
monica_geller It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
rachel_green Well, what about my stuff?
monica_geller You don't have any stuff.
rachel_green You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
monica_geller No.
rachel_green Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
monica_geller Mmmmm.
rachel_green Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
dr_ross_geller Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
phoebe_buffay Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
dr_ross_geller Please tell me you're joking.
phoebe_buffay Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
dr_ross_geller No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
phoebe_buffay What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
dr_ross_geller Is there blood coming out of my ears?
joey_tribbiani Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
chandler_bing Wow, he looks so normal.
phoebe_buffay He's even kind of cute.
joey_tribbiani "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
chandler_bing Funniest? Heckles?
joey_tribbiani That's what it says.
chandler_bing Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
phoebe_buffay I'd call that excessive.
chandler_bing Whoa!
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
joey_tribbiani So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
chandler_bing I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
joey_tribbiani Have you been here all night?
chandler_bing Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
joey_tribbiani Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
chandler_bing Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
joey_tribbiani All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
chandler_bing What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
joey_tribbiani Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
chandler_bing How do you know that? How?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
chandler_bing You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
joey_tribbiani Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
chandler_bing Yeah, I understand.
joey_tribbiani You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
chandler_bing You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
joey_tribbiani Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
chandler_bing Hi, it's me.
janice Oh, my, god.
phoebe_buffay Janice? You called Janice?
chandler_bing Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
dr_ross_geller You remember Janice, right?
chandler_bing Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
janice Helloo!!
chandler_bing Oh, my, god!
joey_tribbiani Geez, look how fat she got.
janice Hey, it's everybody.
chandler_bing Janice, you're--
janice Yes, I am.
chandler_bing Is it--?
janice Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
chandler_bing Congratulations.
janice Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
chandler_bing You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
janice And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
monica_geller Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Hide the Lamp.
rachel_green Monica, let it go.
monica_geller Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
rachel_green Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
phoebe_buffay Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
dr_ross_geller Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
phoebe_buffay Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
dr_ross_geller It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
dr_ross_geller There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe you caved.
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
rachel_green I am. Let me just get my coat.
monica_geller Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
rachel_green Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
monica_geller Phoebe, tell her!
phoebe_buffay Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
rachel_green Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
chandler_bing Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
rachel_green Ok, you win.
monica_geller Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
chandler_bing Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
phoebe_buffay Uh huh. Why is that?
chandler_bing If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
monica_geller You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
chandler_bing Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
rachel_green Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
monica_geller You are not a freak. You're a guy.
rachel_green She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
monica_geller Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
chandler_bing In a bad way?
monica_geller No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
rachel_green Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
phoebe_buffay Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
monica_geller You made it!
phoebe_buffay You're there!
rachel_green You are ready to make a commitment!
chandler_bing Whoa! Don't know about that.
rachel_green What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
monica_geller No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
rachel_green Thank you.
monica_geller That's fine.
chandler_bing Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
joey_tribbiani Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
chandler_bing I'll take that.
joey_tribbiani You want his yearbook?
chandler_bing Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
monica_geller Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
rachel_green It's really not that big!
chandler_bing Takin' that with you, huh?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah.
dr_ross_geller You comin'?
chandler_bing Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
alison#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode03 Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
chandler_bing Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her
