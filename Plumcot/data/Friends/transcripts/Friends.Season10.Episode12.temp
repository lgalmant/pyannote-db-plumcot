phoebe Oh, hey Joey.
joey Uh, hey.
phoebe Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
joey Yeah.
phoebe Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
joey So he can't come?
phoebe No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
joey Seriously?
phoebe Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
joey I am pretty wisdomous.
phoebe So... what do you say?
joey Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
phoebe Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
joey Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
phoebe Oh.
joey Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
phoebe Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
monica Well, it matters to me!
phoebe Well, I don't care, so you pick!
monica Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
phoebe Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
monica You don't know military time?
phoebe Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
monica Just subtract twelve.
phoebe Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
monica Six o'clock!
phoebe Ok.
monica Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
phoebe Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
monica Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
phoebe What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
monica Ooh... she backed out.
phoebe She did? Why?
monica I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
phoebe Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hey!
chandler You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
phoebe Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
chandler No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
phoebe Rehearse it!
ross Hi!
mike Thanks for coming you guys.
ross Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
mike Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
ross That is why!
mike Yeah.
phoebe So Rach.
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Where is Emma?
rachel Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
monica Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
joey Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
mikes_mother Yes, we are.
joey Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
mikes_father How's that?
joey You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
mikes_father Who in God's name are you?
joey Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
chandler You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
ross Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
rachel Uh... November?
ross I wanna say it's not looking good.
rachel Hey Pheebs...
phoebe What's up?
rachel Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
chandler Heh.
phoebe Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
ross What?
rachel Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
phoebe I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
ross Oh, man!
chandler This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
ross FOOTBALL!
chandler Thank you.
monica Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
phoebe Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
monica Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
phoebe I don't have a fax machine.
monica Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
ross I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
chandler I know, I hate being left out of things.
ross And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
mike Hey guys, how is it going?
chandler Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
mike Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
chandler What happened?
ross Who cares, AND?
mike ..and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...
ross I'll do it!
chandler M-Me-me-me!
mike You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
chandler Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
ross No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?
mike You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
ross Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
chandler Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
ross Please, you're going down!
chandler You are going downer!
ross Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
chandler I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
joey So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
mike Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
joey Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
mike I intend to marry her.
joey Oh, a wiseacre. No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
mike No more so than acting.
joey Strike two!
mike You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
joey Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
ross So, what did you decide?
phoebe I decided to pee.
chandler Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
phoebe Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
chandler Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
phoebe Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
rachel Goody, what is it!
phoebe Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
rachel What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
phoebe All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
ross I'll do it!
monica Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
mike Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
monica You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
mike Is that what you say to Chandler?
monica It's 2101 and I am not amused. Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
phoebe Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
monica oh God.
phoebe And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
monica What?
phoebe YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Happy wedding day!
phoebe Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
rachel Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
joey Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
monica Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
phoebe Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
monica Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
phoebe Wow, this is a lot!
monica Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
phoebe You won awards?
monica Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
ross Hey!
monica Hi.
ross Where's Rach?
monica She's in her room, why?
ross I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
rachel What d'you want?
ross You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
rachel Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
ross I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
rachel Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
ross Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
rachel Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
ross YES, YES!
phoebe Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
monica I know.
mike Hey.
phoebe Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
mike Orchids?
phoebe Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
joey Hello Michael.
mike Joseph.
joey May I have a word with you, please?
mike This is... great...
joey Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
mike Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
joey More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
mike Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
joey I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
mike Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
joey That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
mike That must have been one lousy movie.
joey That was ME!
rachel Hi
chandler Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
rachel Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
chandler Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
rachel All right fine, I pick you.
chandler Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
rachel Oh my...
phoebe No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
joey I'm glad we had this little talk.
mike Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
phoebe Okay.
monica Bye.
mike Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
phoebe Oh my God, what's it doing here?
monica Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
phoebe Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
joey How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
chandler How's it going?
ross Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
chandler That's what I was doing too.
ross Well, you have fun tonight.
chandler You too.
ross Oh, I will.
chandler Me too.
ross Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
chandler I'm not supposed to tell you.
ross I'm not supposed to tell you!
chandler You told us both we could be in the wedding?
rachel Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
ross Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
chandler Rach, Rach, knock knock.
rachel Who's there?
chandler I'll tell you at the wedding.
rachel Uh.
mike Hey, I forgot my scarf.
rachel You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
mike Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
ross What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
rachel Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
phoebe Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
monica How's it going?
phoebe Help me.
monica What?
phoebe I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
monica Really?
phoebe Please?
monica You really want me to come back?
phoebe More than I wanna get married.
monica Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
joey Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
phoebe About what?
joey The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
monica Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
joey I don't think they are.
ross Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
monica Well, the club lost it's power.
joey Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
rachel Since when do you watch the news?
joey Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
ross I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
phoebe I know.
rachel Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
phoebe What?
rachel Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
phoebe What do you think?
mike I think I wanna get married to you today.
phoebe Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
monica AFFIRMATIVE!
monica OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
mikes_mom Michael!
mike Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! Hi! Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
mikes_mom No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
mikes_dad I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... Come on, sweetheart.
mike You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
chandler So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
mike I guess.
chandler_and_ross I'll do it!
ross No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
chandler I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
ross Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
monica Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
mike Oh, no!
joey Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
monica Really?
joey Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
ross Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
joey I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
monica Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
chandler I'll do it.
ross I'll...
chandler Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
monica Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
monica Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
phoebe Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
monica So, you're ready to do this?
phoebe Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
rachel Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
phoebe Oh, thank you.
monica I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
phoebe I love you guys.
rachel_and_monica I love you.
monica Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
chandler Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
monica I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
chandler Oh yeah!
monica Okay Marjorie, hit it.
rachel Geez Ross, you could have showered.
ross It's the dog.
monica Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
chandler Ready?
phoebe Okay.
chandler Okay.
phoebe Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
chandler Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
phoebe I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
chandler You look beautiful.
phoebe Thank you.
mike My God! Aren't you freezing?
phoebe Na-ah.
joey Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
joey Okay...
phoebe When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family.
mike Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
phoebe Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
mike I love you too.
ross Uh Joey...
joey Yeah?
ross Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
joey Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
phoebe I do.
joey Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
mike I do.
joey I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
phoebe I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
chandler That really was an incredible wedding.
joey It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
chandler I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
joey Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
chandler I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
ross Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
