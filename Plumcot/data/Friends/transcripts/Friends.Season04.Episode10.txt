dr_ross_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
phoebe_buffay Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
dr_ross_geller 15? Your personal best!
phoebe_buffay Where were you?
dr_ross_geller Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
phoebe_buffay Oh, which museum?
phoebe_buffay No, answer his.
dr_ross_geller Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
chandler_bing Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
dr_ross_geller No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
chandler_bing How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
joey_tribbiani Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
chandler_bing Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
phoebe_buffay Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
chandler_bing All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
rachel_green Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang! - before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
chandler_bing Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
rachel_green Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
joey_tribbiani Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
chandler_bing Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
rachel_green Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
chandler_bing Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
rachel_green Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
chandler_bing Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
all@ Hey!
phoebe_buffay What's wrong Mon?
monica_geller Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
monica_geller I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
phoebe_buffay Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
rachel_green Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
monica_geller I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
joey_tribbiani Ohhh!
monica_geller I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
rachel_green Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
monica_geller I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
chandler_bing Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
monica_geller That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
joey_tribbiani Good enough to get fired.
monica_geller All right, you're hired!
joey_tribbiani Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
chandler_bing Yes.
chandler_bing I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
drew I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
chandler_bing See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
drew Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
chandler_bing Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
mike Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
chandler_bing Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
mike Oh wow! I'm free for her!
drew Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
mike Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
drew Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
chandler_bing Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
mike Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
chandler_bing Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
phoebe_buffay Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
joey_tribbiani@monica_geller@rachel_green Yes!
phoebe_buffay Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
rachel_green Pheebs, that's great!
phoebe_buffay Oh, yay!
rachel_green But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
phoebe_buffay I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
joey_tribbiani What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
phoebe_buffay All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
monica_geller Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
rachel_green Oh yeah!
phoebe_buffay Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
chandler_bing Hello, children!
all@ Hey!
chandler_bing Have I got the 50 guys for you!
rachel_green Really?!
chandler_bing Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
joey_tribbiani Sure! Where are the seats?
chandler_bing Wherever! I've got like 20!
rachel_green So, will I like any of these guys?
chandler_bing Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
rachel_green Chandler!
chandler_bing Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
phoebe_buffay You work with robots!!
chandler_bing Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
rachel_green Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
chandler_bing Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
rachel_green Op, I like credit cards!
chandler_bing See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
rachel_green Well, so what does he do?
chandler_bing Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
rachel_green Your company has a fine foods division?
chandler_bing It's a big company, I don't - if you - I
joey_tribbiani Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
phoebe_buffay No! No, the robots just work for them.
monica_geller All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
monica_geller You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
joey_tribbiani Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
monica_geller You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
chandler_bing Oh yeah! With who?
dr_ross_geller You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
phoebe_buffay If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
dr_ross_geller Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was - if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey, man!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
joey_tribbiani Damn!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
monica_geller They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
joey_tribbiani You got it! Oh-oh!
monica_geller What are you doing?!
joey_tribbiani It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
monica_geller Thanks. I think you got it!
rachel_green Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
chandler_bing Well, like father, like son.
rachel_green Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
chandler_bing Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
rachel_green Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
chandler_bing Ummmmmmmm, no.
rachel_green You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
chandler_bing Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get - oh I see.
rachel_green Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date - oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
monica_geller Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
a_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
joey_tribbiani There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
monica_geller Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag - Why is nobody writing these down?
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Because we can remember them.
monica_geller Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Well, sure, that too.
monica_geller Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Can't hear you!
monica_geller A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
joey_tribbiani No ma'am.
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
monica_geller What the hell happened?!
joey_tribbiani I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
monica_geller Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
joey_tribbiani And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
monica_geller What kinda things have you been saying?
joey_tribbiani Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
phoebe_buffay Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry
chandler_bing Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay What?
chandler_bing I'm not Jewish, so
phoebe_buffay So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
chandler_bing Bad dream?
dr_ross_geller I wasn't sleeping.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
dr_ross_geller The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
phoebe_buffay So, did you pick one yet?
dr_ross_geller No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought - it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
phoebe_buffay Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
dr_ross_geller Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
chandler_bing Prague?
phoebe_buffay There's sooo much you don't know.
rachel_green Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
chandler_bing I did! I absolutely did!
rachel_green You idiot!!
chandler_bing I'm sure you're right, but why?
rachel_green You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
chandler_bing Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
rachel_green Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
chandler_bing I know! I know!
rachel_green Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
chandler_bing Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
rachel_green Really?
chandler_bing Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
rachel_green No.
chandler_bing Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
rachel_green Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
chandler_bing Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
rachel_green Well that sounds fun too.
chandler_bing Have you ever been with a woman?
rachel_green What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
chandler_bing So there is no good time to ask that question.

the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 You found that handle, did ya?
monica_geller That's not funny.
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 Well that's not true.
monica_geller I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is
joey_tribbiani Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
monica_geller You do?
joey_tribbiani You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
monica_geller Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
joey_tribbiani What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
monica_geller You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 No.
monica_geller How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
the_waiter#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode10 No, it's really good.
monica_geller Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
the_conductor Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
dr_ross_geller What?
the_woman_on_the_train I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
dr_ross_geller What?
the_woman_on_the_train We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
dr_ross_geller Are we really in Montreal?!
the_woman_on_the_train Yes we are. So, coffee?
dr_ross_geller Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
the_woman_on_the_train Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
joey_tribbiani Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
monica_geller Thanks.
joey_tribbiani Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
monica_geller Enough!
joey_tribbiani Lean-lean-lean!
phoebe_buffay "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. No, don't sing along.
