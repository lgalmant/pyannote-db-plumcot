susie_moss I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
directors_assistant#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode13 Is it bad?
susie_moss It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
directors_assistant#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode13 I'll talk to her.
susie_moss I hate actors.
chandler_bing Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.

susie_moss Chandler Bing?
chandler_bing Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
susie_moss I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
chandler_bing Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. great job growing up.
susie_moss It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
chandler_bing Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
susie_moss Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
chandler_bing Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
monica_geller Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
rachel_green What what what what?
monica_geller Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
rachel_green Ya think?
monica_geller The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see
rachel_green No, was he any good in it?
monica_geller Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
rachel_green Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
monica_geller Oh, yeah.
rachel_green What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
monica_geller He could hear me.
rachel_green OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
monica_geller Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't,
rachel_green Excuse me. Hi.
jeanclaude_van_damme Hi.
rachel_green Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
jeanclaude_van_damme You don't think I'm cute?
rachel_green I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
jeanclaude_van_damme You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
chandler_bing No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
susie_moss OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
chandler_bing OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
susie_moss Oh that's me, I gotta go.
chandler_bing Oh uh, o, OK.
susie_moss Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
chandler_bing Well, uh, let's try one more. there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
susie_moss I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
chandler_bing No one was around to hear that?
monica_geller So what'd he say?
rachel_green Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
monica_geller Well, thanks anyway.
rachel_green He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
monica_geller Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
rachel_green Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
rachel_green And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
joey_tribbiani Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. no guys around, huh.
rachel_green Does anybody need anything?
monica_geller Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
rachel_green That is so unfair.
phoebe_buffay I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
dr_ross_geller Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
joey_tribbiani You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
dr_ross_geller Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
chandler_bing Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
phoebe_buffay Stick a fork what?
chandler_bing Like, when you're cooking a steak.
phoebe_buffay Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
chandler_bing Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
phoebe_buffay Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
chandler_bing OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
chandler_bing I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
monica_geller What did you say?
chandler_bing Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
phoebe_buffay Oh, you just know.
susie_moss Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
chandler_bing Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
susie_moss Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
susie_moss But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
chandler_bing Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
susie_moss Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
chandler_bing You want me to wear your panties?
susie_moss Could ya?
chandler_bing Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. You're swell.
dr_ross_geller OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.

dr_ross_geller Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
phoebe_buffay OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
rachel_green Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
phoebe_buffay Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
monica_geller Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
rachel_green That is the most ridiculous.
monica_geller You sold me out.
rachel_green I did not sell you out.
monica_geller Yes you did. Absolutely.
rachel_green Would you let me talk.
monica_geller Did you just flick me?
rachel_green OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
monica_geller Quit flicking
rachel_green Ow, you stop flicking.
monica_geller You flicked me first.
phoebe_buffay OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
monica_geller@rachel_green Ow. Ow. Ow.
phoebe_buffay Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
rachel_green Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
monica_geller Uh-huh.
rachel_green You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
monica_geller OK.

jeanclaude_van_damme Sure.
monica_geller This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
jeanclaude_van_damme Normally, I would not do it.
monica_geller Well, what made you make the exception for me?
jeanclaude_van_damme 'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...

rachel_green No.

phoebe_buffay Oh alright, stop,
phoebe_buffay Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
monica_geller I'll help you fix your sweater.
