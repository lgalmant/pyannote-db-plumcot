phoebe Hey! I got you a present!!
chandler Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
phoebe I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
chandler Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang
monica I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
phoebe It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
monica Oh my God!
phoebe I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
monica Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
chandler Oh, okay.
monica All right.
chandler I kinda like it here.
phoebe Do you really like it?
monica Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
phoebe Oh really? What was your first?
monica Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
chandler Well what did it do?
monica Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
chandler A vending machine?
monica Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
ross Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
joey Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
ross Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
rachel They made you head of the department!
ross No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didn't I get head of the department?
joey Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
rachel Yeah.
joey I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
rachel Uh, Paul's Cafá. They got great food and it's really romantic.
joey Ooh, great! Thanks!
rachel Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!
joey You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya
rachel Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
joey Hey, y'know what?
rachel Huh?
joey Why don't I take you out?
rachel What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
joey Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
rachel Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
joey I'll be fun.
rachel All right?
phoebe No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
monica Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
phoebe Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
monica Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
chandler Who cares? It's a stupid game.
monica You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
chandler I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
phoebe Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
monica No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
chandler Why do you want to play this game so bad?
phoebe Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
monica Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
rachel Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
joey No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
rachel Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
joey And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so
rachel Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.
joey Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
rachel Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
joey I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
rachel Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
joey Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?
rachel Hm-mmm.
joey Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
rachel Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
joey No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
ross ...which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance. Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
student Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.
ross What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
student Ooh, dude. That's not gonna happen.
ross Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!
ross Hello. I'm sorry I'm a little late. Ah--Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.
rachel Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
waitress There's a side of steamed vegetables.
rachel Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
joey Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
rachel Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
joey Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
rachel Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
joey No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for- I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.
rachel I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
joey Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
rachel Oh my God. And that works?!
joey Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
rachel Oh, you poor little famous man.
joey Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can.
rachel Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
joey Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
rachel Alright. So where'd you grow up?
joey That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
rachel Come on, just answer the question!
joey Queens.
rachel And so were-were you close to your parents?
joey Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
rachel Why not?
joey I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
rachel Oh. It's gotta be rough.
joey Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
rachel Huh?
joey "Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
rachel Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
joey Yeah.
rachel And now you're watching me walk away.
joey Yes I am! Again so simple!
monica Hey.
chandler You are not going to believe what I did today!
monica Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
chandler I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
monica Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
chandler Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
monica What is the matter with your hand?
chandler Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words.
monica Chandler, why would you do that?
chandler Because it's awesome.
monica You think this is clever?
chandler Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
monica Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
chandler It is when you put it together with that one.
monica Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
chandler Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
monica Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
chandler Have you talked to him lately?
monica All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
chandler No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
monica Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
chandler With the claw?!
monica All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
chandler Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
rachel I am not gonna answer that!
joey Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
rachel No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
joey Chandler?
rachel Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
joey Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
rachel I know!
joey I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
rachel Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
joey I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
rachel Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
joey Huh. Huh.
rachel All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
joey Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
rachel So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?
joey Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
rachel How do you do that?
joey Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm.
rachel Oh my God!
joey Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
rachel No, I don't want to tell you.
joey Why not?
rachel Because it's embarrassing.
joey More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
rachel Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
joey Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya
rachel All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
joey Oh. Yeah. Me to.
rachel ...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
ross No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
rachel Well, why didn't you just take a cab?
ross Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
rachel Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
ross Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter.
rachel You what?
ross You've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
rachel Right. Wow!
ross Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars.
joey Hey!
rachel Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
joey Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
rachel Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
joey Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
rachel Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
joey Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.
rachel Well don't you have that big date tonight?
joey Oh right!
rachel Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
joey Yeah.
rachel After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
joey Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
rachel I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster
joey Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
rachel Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
joey Yeah me too, all night.
rachel Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
joey Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
monica Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
phoebe Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
monica They're all Chandler.
phoebe Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
chandler I did. But it came at a price.
monica But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
chandler Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
ross Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! Okay, why don't we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where... Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots. Okay, umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-
joeys_date Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
joey No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?
joeys_date You mean like from behind?
joey Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
joeys_date Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
joey Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
joeys_date Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
joey Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
monica Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
phoebe I know!
chandler One more score to go! You can do it!
phoebe Don't touch me!!
monica Don't touch her!!
chandler All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
phoebe I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
ross Phoebe!!
phoebe Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
rachel Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
joey Alone?!
rachel Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
joey Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
rachel No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
joey Oh uh, it didn't work out.
rachel Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
joey Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
rachel Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
joey Oh sure, yeah, why not?
rachel Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
joey All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
rachel Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
joey Terrified.
ross So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs
