chandler_bing Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
monica_geller I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
chandler_bing I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
monica_geller I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
chandler_bing Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
monica_geller Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
chandler_bing You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
monica_geller Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
chandler_bing No! We're not borrowing money.
monica_geller Why not?
chandler_bing Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
monica_geller Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
chandler_bing That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
mike_hannigan I'm gonna go.
phoebe_buffay Why??
mike_hannigan I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
phoebe_buffay Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
mike_hannigan I put that tube top on as a joke.
phoebe_buffay I want you to stay.
mike_hannigan I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..
phoebe_buffay Why don't you turn them inside ou...
mike_hannigan Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
phoebe_buffay I'll miss you.
mike_hannigan Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
phoebe_buffay Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
mike_hannigan No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
phoebe_buffay Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
mike_hannigan So we're doing it?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
mike_hannigan Yeah!
phoebe_buffay I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
monica_geller Hey Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
joey_tribbiani I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
monica_geller Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
joey_tribbiani Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
monica_geller But Chandler lent you money!
joey_tribbiani And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
monica_geller Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
joey_tribbiani Oh...how much?
monica_geller Two thousand dollars?
joey_tribbiani Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
monica_geller Yeah...
joey_tribbiani That's right I am!
rachel_green Hi you guys!
joey_tribbiani@monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Oo...what's in the bag?
rachel_green Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
joey_tribbiani Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
monica_geller Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
rachel_green No. I was just going to do this myself.
joey_tribbiani You're gonna do it?
rachel_green Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
joey_tribbiani Oh, women can. You can't.
rachel_green Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
monica_geller You're a pig. And you can't do this.
rachel_green Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
joey_tribbiani The hardware store is right down the street.
rachel_green There is a hardware store right down the street?
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
mike_hannigan Phoebe and I are moving in together.
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller@monica_geller Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
phoebe_buffay I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
monica_geller Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
chandler_bing Yeah.... she's not so cute.
mike_hannigan I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
mike_hannigan Yes dear.
monica_geller Is that a bit you guys do?
phoebe_buffay Uh huh...we're playing you two.
monica_geller We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
chandler_bing Yes dear.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
monica_geller I hear wedding bells.
phoebe_buffay Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
phoebe_buffay I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
mike_hannigan You ready to go?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! You bet roomy!
monica_geller Don't you mean..groomy?
mike_hannigan What are you talking about?
phoebe_buffay Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.
phoebe_buffay China patterns!!!!!
rachel_green This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
chandler_bing Hey Joe!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
joey_tribbiani I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
chandler_bing And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I know.
chandler_bing What? What do you mean you know?
joey_tribbiani Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
chandler_bing Oh! Right.
joey_tribbiani That's the fastest I have ever thought!
chandler_bing Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
chandler_bing Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
joey_tribbiani Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
chandler_bing Oh ok.
joey_tribbiani I am on fire!
chandler_bing Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
joey_tribbiani Err... Kind of.
chandler_bing I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
joey_tribbiani Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Something personal.
chandler_bing What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode16 Excuse me.
joey_tribbiani Boob job.
monica_geller I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
joey_tribbiani Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
mike_hannigan Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
mike_hannigan I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
phoebe_buffay Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
mike_hannigan Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
phoebe_buffay What do you mean?
mike_hannigan Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Wow.
mike_hannigan It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
phoebe_buffay Was it really that bad?
mike_hannigan At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
phoebe_buffay Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
mike_hannigan Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
phoebe_buffay But it's just...
mike_hannigan Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
mike_hannigan I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
phoebe_buffay No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
mike_hannigan Trust me, I will never...
phoebe_buffay Yeah I get that.
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller So you gave in and decided to call someone?
rachel_green Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
the_handyman You're all set.
rachel_green Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
the_handyman Thanks.....
chandler_bing Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
rachel_green Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
monica_geller Thank you?
chandler_bing Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
monica_geller Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
chandler_bing No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
monica_geller Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
chandler_bing Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
monica_geller Okay...
chandler_bing I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
rachel_green Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
monica_geller I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
rachel_green I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
monica_geller Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
rachel_green No you really think that's what it is?
monica_geller You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
rachel_green Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!
phoebe_buffay Hi
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
dr_ross_geller Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
phoebe_buffay No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
dr_ross_geller Why?
phoebe_buffay Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
dr_ross_geller Never?
phoebe_buffay Never.
dr_ross_geller wow, are you still going to move in with him?
phoebe_buffay I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
phoebe_buffay That's not how you really feel is it?
dr_ross_geller No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
phoebe_buffay Seriously? You divorce-o?
dr_ross_geller If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay It's ok that's how you feel.
dr_ross_geller But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
phoebe_buffay I do love Mike.
dr_ross_geller Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
phoebe_buffay Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
dr_ross_geller The Divorcer, to the rescue!
phoebe_buffay It's not cooler.
dr_ross_geller Yeah I just hurt it.
joey_tribbiani Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
chandler_bing Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
monica_geller Honey?
chandler_bing Yeah?
monica_geller About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
chandler_bing But honey you don't have to.
monica_geller I'm going to get bigger!
chandler_bing Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
rachel_green Argh. fascist
monica_geller Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
chandler_bing your ass?!?!?
rachel_green Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
chandler_bing They...do that?
monica_geller It's kind of a package deal!
chandler_bing God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
monica_geller I thought I was something that we both wanted!
chandler_bing Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
rachel_green Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
chandler_bing What?
rachel_green Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
joey_tribbiani Because she is!
monica_geller Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
joey_tribbiani Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
chandler_bing@monica_geller@rachel_green It's over/Joe!
joey_tribbiani OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
dr_ross_geller Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
phoebe_buffay Better.
mike_hannigan Very cool.
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
dr_ross_geller Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
phoebe_buffay What do you mean?
dr_ross_geller Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
phoebe_buffay They are awfully boxy...
dr_ross_geller I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
phoebe_buffay Uh huh.
dr_ross_geller Hey hey, can I help?
chandler_bing Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
dr_ross_geller You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
joey_tribbiani Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
rachel_green Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
phoebe_buffay Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
mike_hannigan No but... You don't want to get married either right?
phoebe_buffay Right. Except that I do want to get married.
joey_tribbiani Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
mike_hannigan You wanna get married?
phoebe_buffay Someday.
chandler_bing Aaaaand....... hernia.
phoebe_buffay I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
mike_hannigan But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
phoebe_buffay Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
mike_hannigan I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
phoebe_buffay But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
mike_hannigan Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
phoebe_buffay Are you gonna change yours?
mike_hannigan No.
phoebe_buffay Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
mike_hannigan But I don't want this to end.
phoebe_buffay I don't want it to end either.
mike_hannigan I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
mike_hannigan Ok... so... Goodbye.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@monica_geller@rachel_green Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
rachel_green I'm so sorry Pheebs.
monica_geller We're all sorry...
chandler_bing Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
joey_tribbiani AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
