dr_ross_geller You said you'd marry Joey?
rachel_green Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! I'm not helping.
dr_ross_geller So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
rachel_green That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
dr_ross_geller So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
rachel_green Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
dr_ross_geller Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!
rachel_green Ooooo!
joey_tribbiani Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
dr_ross_geller Rachel said she'd marry you?!
joey_tribbiani This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
monica_geller Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
phoebe_buffay No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
monica_geller So sexy. Honey.
chandler_bing Yea yea.
monica_geller Honey why don't you go lie down.
chandler_bing No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
joey_tribbiani Why're you so tired?
chandler_bing Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
joey_tribbiani You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
rachel_green Hi!
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode02 Hi, welcome home!
monica_geller Phoebe did the signs!
rachel_green Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
phoebe_buffay Look at all the stuff people sent!

joey_tribbiani Hey so where's Ross?
rachel_green He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
joey_tribbiani Is he still mad at us?
rachel_green Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
joey_tribbiani That's not fair! I can't do that.
rachel_green Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
joey_tribbiani See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.
chandler_bing Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
ms_mckenna The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
ms_mckenna Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I'll go straight to my forty two point plan.
chandler_bing Walter
phoebe_buffay She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
monica_geller Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
dr_ross_geller Okay I put most of the stuff away.
rachel_green Oh great, the pacifiers?
dr_ross_geller In the closet.
rachel_green The burping clogs?

rachel_green Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
dr_ross_geller Sure what kind?
rachel_green Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
dr_ross_geller Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
rachel_green Blueberry.
dr_ross_geller Blueberry it is.
rachel_green Thanks.
monica_geller Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
rachel_green God how long do you think that's gonna last?
phoebe_buffay I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
rachel_green Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
phoebe_buffay You know that's... that's her.
rachel_green Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
rachel_green Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
phoebe_buffay I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.

phoebe_buffay Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
monica_geller Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
rachel_green Ok.
monica_geller It worked!
rachel_green Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
monica_geller Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
rachel_green Yeah, I'm not so sure.
monica_geller Oh my god, I am losing my mind.

dr_ross_geller Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
gunther Diapers huh?
dr_ross_geller Yep.

dr_ross_geller Yep, can you believe it?
gunther Nope! I still can't believe she slept with you in the first place.
dr_ross_geller Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?
joey_tribbiani Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
dr_ross_geller Ah actually we don't.
joey_tribbiani Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
dr_ross_geller What! You didn't do anything wrong?!
joey_tribbiani I said I didn't technically.
dr_ross_geller Okay let's put aside that you "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
joey_tribbiani Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
dr_ross_geller And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
joey_tribbiani I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
dr_ross_geller Not using it right, Joe.
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna go.
joey_tribbiani No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
dr_ross_geller Give me the bag.
joey_tribbiani No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
dr_ross_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
dr_ross_geller I'm not gonna hit you.
joey_tribbiani Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
dr_ross_geller No I don't.

joey_tribbiani I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
dr_ross_geller Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
joey_tribbiani I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
dr_ross_geller What is the matter with you?!?
joey_tribbiani You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
dr_ross_geller Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
joey_tribbiani Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
monica_geller Try feeding her again.
rachel_green I already fed her.
monica_geller I know, that's why I said again!
phoebe_buffay Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.
chandler_bing Hey.

chandler_bing Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
rachel_green Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
phoebe_buffay Oh I'm kinda part of this.
chandler_bing Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
phoebe_buffay I knew I should have married Chandler.
monica_geller Okay what's up
chandler_bing Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
monica_geller Oh yeah
chandler_bing Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
monica_geller What? Who says that?
chandler_bing People who've never ever been to Paris.
monica_geller What's going on?
chandler_bing We're moving to Tulsa!
monica_geller Excuse me?
chandler_bing Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
monica_geller Tulsa, Oklahoma!
chandler_bing The Sooner State, whatever that is.
monica_geller Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
chandler_bing Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
monica_geller Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
chandler_bing No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
monica_geller Thank you.
chandler_bing What is wrong with Emma?
monica_geller Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
chandler_bing Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
ms_mckenna What?
chandler_bing It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
ms_mckenna You fell asleep?
chandler_bing But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
ms_mckenna Chandler, I
chandler_bing No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
joey_tribbiani Hey, so how is it?
dr_ross_geller I broke my thumb.
joey_tribbiani Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
dr_ross_geller You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
joey_tribbiani You, you want me to help you with that?
dr_ross_geller Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
joey_tribbiani Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
dr_ross_geller Just Ross!
joey_tribbiani It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
dr_ross_geller You know my birthday.
joey_tribbiani Sure, May...tember.
dr_ross_geller October 18th.
joey_tribbiani Occupation? Dinosaurs.
dr_ross_geller Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.
joey_tribbiani Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
dr_ross_geller Ah, Rachel I guess.
joey_tribbiani Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
dr_ross_geller Just ah... just put roommate.
joey_tribbiani Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?
dr_ross_geller I don't think that we are.
joey_tribbiani But you two were supposed to be together.
dr_ross_geller Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
joey_tribbiani Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
dr_ross_geller Yeah that's what she said.
joey_tribbiani So?
dr_ross_geller So I don't wanna be just anybody.
joey_tribbiani Wow.
dr_ross_geller You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
joey_tribbiani Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani And you're Okay with that?
dr_ross_geller Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine.
joey_tribbiani Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
dr_ross_geller Hey there you go!
joey_tribbiani "Thanks."
rachel_green Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
monica_geller About a week and a half.
phoebe_buffay Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
monica_geller Rach, try holding her a different way.
rachel_green You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
phoebe_buffay Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
rachel_green Here you go.
phoebe_buffay Shh! Nothing works with this child!
rachel_green Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
monica_geller You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
rachel_green Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
monica_geller Okay I'll take her, here.
rachel_green I have to go to the bathroom.
phoebe_buffay I have to go scream into a pillow.
monica_geller Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
phoebe_buffay Have I gone deaf?
monica_geller It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
phoebe_buffay You must be a fireball in bed.
monica_geller I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
phoebe_buffay I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
rachel_green Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
monica_geller Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt
rachel_green You are the official baby crier stopper!
monica_geller Yes I am!!

phoebe_buffay Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months
rachel_green Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
chandler_bing Oh so there can't be any yelling.
monica_geller No.
