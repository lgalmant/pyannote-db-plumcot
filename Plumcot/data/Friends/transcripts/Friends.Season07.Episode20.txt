rachel_green Okay!
joey_tribbiani Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
rachel_green Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
dr_ross_geller She seems really, really fun!
rachel_green She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
monica_geller Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you
joey_tribbiani Who you what? Who you what?!
rachel_green Yes.
monica_geller Wow!
joey_tribbiani Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
rachel_green It's not a big deal!
monica_geller They were lovers.
dr_ross_geller What?!
joey_tribbiani What?!
rachel_green No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
dr_ross_geller So that's two of my wives.
monica_geller Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
rachel_green Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
monica_geller Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
chandler_bing This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
monica_geller Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
joey_tribbiani Hello!
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach.
rachel_green Stop picturing it!!
monica_geller Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
joey_tribbiani Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
monica_geller Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
joey_tribbiani What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
monica_geller Why would they think they're invited?
joey_tribbiani You got me. I don't
monica_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
monica_geller Ross's parents are my parents!
joey_tribbiani Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
chandler_bing Y'know I think we should invite them.
monica_geller Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
chandler_bing Well this is just sad!
monica_geller All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
rachel_green That is not a problem.
joey_tribbiani Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
rachel_green Oh, get out of here!
rachel_green So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
chandler_bing Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
rachel_green I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
chandler_bing Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
rachel_green Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
chandler_bing You mean like for award shows?
rachel_green Some of them.
chandler_bing You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
rachel_green Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
chandler_bing Okay, who wore those?
rachel_green Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
chandler_bing Not bad.
rachel_green This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
chandler_bing Who's that?
rachel_green He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
chandler_bing Pierce Brosnan?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
chandler_bing Are you serious?
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing 007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
rachel_green It's a pretty cool tux.
chandler_bing Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
joey_tribbiani We should really learn how to play the real way.
phoebe_buffay I like our way. Oh! Chess!
joey_tribbiani Nice move.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
joey_tribbiani No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
rachel_green Well, what are you going to wear?
joey_tribbiani Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
rachel_green Huh. Does Monica know about this?
joey_tribbiani I don't think so.
rachel_green Can I please be there when you tell her?
phoebe_buffay Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
rachel_green Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
joey_tribbiani Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
phoebe_buffay What is this? What's going on?
joey_tribbiani Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
rachel_green Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
phoebe_buffay Joey's!
joey_tribbiani Okay
rachel_green Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
rachel_green It-it did!
phoebe_buffay Sure!
joey_tribbiani Hey. It happened!
rachel_green Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
phoebe_buffay Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
joey_tribbiani Why are you taking this away from me?
rachel_green Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
phoebe_buffay Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
rachel_green I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
phoebe_buffay Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
rachel_green Vanilla?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
phoebe_buffay To Ross.
rachel_green All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
phoebe_buffay Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
chandler_bing A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
dr_ross_geller No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
chandler_bing What?
dr_ross_geller That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
chandler_bing You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
dr_ross_geller So?
chandler_bing So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
dr_ross_geller Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
chandler_bing Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
dr_ross_geller Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
chandler_bing Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
dr_ross_geller When I got married you slept with my sister.
chandler_bing That was pretty 007.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, they're not coming.
monica_geller What?!
joey_tribbiani Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
monica_geller Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
joey_tribbiani Look Mon, if you could just call my mom
monica_geller Oh Joey!
joey_tribbiani Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
monica_geller No she hasn't.
joey_tribbiani Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
monica_geller Well, what am I going to say?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so
monica_geller Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
melissa_warburton ...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
rachel_green Oh. Oh, that's great!
melissa_warburton Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
phoebe_buffay Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
melissa_warburton What one?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
melissa_warburton Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
rachel_green Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
melissa_warburton What?
rachel_green Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops
melissa_warburton Yeah?
rachel_green ...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
melissa_warburton Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
phoebe_buffay Really?!
chandler_bing Ross is Batman!
monica_geller Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
chandler_bing Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
monica_geller What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
chandler_bing Batman has a utility belt!
monica_geller 007 has a fancy car!
chandler_bing Batman has the Batmobile!
monica_geller 007 gets all the ladies.
chandler_bing Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
monica_geller How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
chandler_bing Actually, I don't like martinis.
monica_geller How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
chandler_bing Ooh, yum!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
monica_geller The show?!
joey_tribbiani Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
monica_geller Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
joey_tribbiani Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
monica_geller The wedding starts at six.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
monica_geller You'll vamp?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
rachel_green How can you not remember us kissing?!
melissa_warburton I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
rachel_green Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
phoebe_buffay Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
rachel_green Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
melissa_warburton I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
rachel_green No!!
phoebe_buffay Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
rachel_green Thank you Phoebe.
melissa_warburton She didn't.
phoebe_buffay I know.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller You just carry that around?
dr_ross_geller Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
monica_geller Between you and
dr_ross_geller Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
chandler_bing I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
monica_geller A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
dr_ross_geller Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
chandler_bing Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
dr_ross_geller What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
chandler_bing Let me try it on!
dr_ross_geller Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
chandler_bing Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
dr_ross_geller Let me see that! Oh man!
chandler_bing The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
monica_geller All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
joey_tribbiani No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
monica_geller Oh.
chandler_bing Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
joey_tribbiani Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
rachel_green It happened! I am telling you it happened!
melissa_warburton Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
rachel_green What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
melissa_warburton My God! You love me!
rachel_green What?
melissa_warburton Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have
rachel_green Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
melissa_warburton Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
rachel_green I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
melissa_warburton Shut up!
rachel_green I'm sorry!
melissa_warburton Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
rachel_green Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna
rachel_green What the hell was that?!
phoebe_buffay I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
rachel_green And?
phoebe_buffay I've had better.
chandler_bing All right! I found one that fits!
rachel_green Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
chandler_bing Whose is it?
rachel_green Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
chandler_bing Whose is it?
rachel_green I don't want to say.
chandler_bing Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
rachel_green Diane Keeton.
