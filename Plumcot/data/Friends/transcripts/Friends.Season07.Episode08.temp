ross Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
chandler No, no, no. No-no-no.
joey_rachel_and_phoebe Shhhh!
ross What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
chandler No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
ross What? That's like insanely easy!
chandler Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen
monica It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
ross What? You forgot fourteen states?
monica Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
chandler Oh, okay, time's up!
rachel All right, I got 48.
chandler Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
phoebe Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.
chandler Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
joey Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
ross Wow, how many have you got?
joey Fifty-six!
joey Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
chandler Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
rachel How come we have one extra place setting?
monica 'Cause you invited your assistant.
rachel Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
monica Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
rachel Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
monica Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
phoebe Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
ross Done! With time a-to-spare.
chandler Oooh that may be a New World's record
ross You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
chandler Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
ross What? That's impossible.
joey 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
monica All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
chandler I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
ross No, just give me another minute.
chandler Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
ross This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
chandler Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
ross You're on!
joey All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
monica Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
joey But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
monica Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
ross Pshhshhh!
monica Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
chandler Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
joey Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
phoebe Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
ross Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
phoebe Oh, it's not!
rachel Seriously, it's moving!
joey What the hell is in there?
phoebe It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
monica Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
chandler I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
monica That's my pie!
chandler Which smells delicious!
monica Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
chandler What?
monica We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
phoebe Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
monica Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
phoebe I'm sorry, who's this?
monica Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
chandler Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
phoebe No, there's no dog here?
monica Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
phoebe Oh my god! Where are you?
monica I'll be right there!
phoebe They're here already? How are they doing this?
rachel Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
tag I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
rachel Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
tag We kinda broke up this morning.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry.
tag Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
ross Ohio!! Thank you!
chandler Huh! Where is the dog?!
ross What dog? There-there's no dog here.
joey Yeah that dog left!
monica Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
phoebe There's no dog in here.
chandler Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
phoebe No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
chandler What is it doing here?
phoebe Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
monica Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
chandler Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
phoebe That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
chandler Really?
monica Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
chandler Well, it still has to go, right?
monica_and_phoebe Why?
chandler Okay, it's um
joey Don't do it!
monica Don't do what?
chandler I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
all What?
phoebe Are you crazy?
ross Are you out of your mind?
phoebe Why?
joey Told ya.
chandler They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
ross Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
rachel Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
chandler Is there a puppy here?
tag You don't like puppies?
chandler Okay, you are new!
joey Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
phoebe You don't like ice cream?
ross It's too cold.
chandler Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
ross It hurts my teeth.
chandler And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
ross How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
monica 1250.
ross Damn, I forgot you were here.
phoebe All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
rachel Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
monica Yeah.
rachel When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
phoebe Oh, I'd say about a month.
monica Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
joey Half hour.
rachel Interesting.
monica When it's your assistant, I would say never.
joey All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
rachel Huh. A moo-point?
joey Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
rachel Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
monica Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
rachel You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
joey Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
rachel Hey!
tag Hey.
rachel How are you holding up?
tag Not bad.
rachel Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
tag Thanks.
rachel So were you guys together a long time?
tag A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
rachel Now that she broke up with you?
tag Yeah.
rachel Yeah. Hmmmm.
tag It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
rachel No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
tag Why?
rachel Because, uh-it has to.
tag You have all the answers, don't you?
rachel Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
tag Hey, thanks for talking to me.
rachel Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
joey All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
tag What?
joey Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
tag What did Joey say? I like you back?
rachel Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
tag Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
rachel No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
tag Wow.
rachel Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
tag Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
rachel What?
tag Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
rachel Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
tag I can't believe this!
rachel Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
monica Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
phoebe Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
monica Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
phoebe Yeah, okay.
monica Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
phoebe You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
monica That's not gonna work.
phoebe I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
monica Hey! I didn't know either.
phoebe Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
monica Yeah, I knew.
phoebe Where's Chandler?
chandler Here I am.
phoebe Wash your hands!!!
chandler How did you...know?
ross Hey! What's she doing back here?
monica Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
ross Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
phoebe No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
ross Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
phoebe See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
chandler Where's Monica?
ross Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
chandler Why not?
ross Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
chandler Well, I, I should go in there.
ross No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
chandler Why not?
ross Because you sent away the dog!
chandler This is ridiculous.
ross Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
joey Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
chandler Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
joey So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
chandler Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
joey Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
chandler And that doesn't scare you?
joey Ross, you need some help?
ross From you? Yes, please!
joey First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
ross I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
joey Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
rachel Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
joey If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
phoebe Hey, is Chandler here?
chandler No, no he went for a walk.
phoebe Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
rachel Hi!
joey Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
phoebe Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
joey You think?
monica Hi, honey.
chandler Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
monica What? Why, why would...
phoebe Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
chandler Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
phoebe We have good news, look whose back!
rachel Hi!
chandler Clunkers?! Oh my god!
monica That's right, she came back all by herself.
phoebe It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
chandler It is so good to see you!
phoebe Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
ross Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
chandler It's up to you.
rachel Oh, hi! How are you doing?
tag I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
rachel Oh.
tag Thanks for having me over, you guys.
ross Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
tag Colorado.
ross Ah, what good are you.
rachel Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
tag Okay.
rachel Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
tag Um, I'm not.
rachel Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
tag No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
rachel Really?
tag Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
rachel Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
ross Delaware! Delaware!
chandler All right.
ross I want my turkey now!
chandler You got it. You got Nevada twice.
ross I know.
chandler Yeah.
