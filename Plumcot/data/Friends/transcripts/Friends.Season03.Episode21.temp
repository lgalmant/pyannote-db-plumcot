chandler Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
joey Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
ross Hey!
chandler Hey.

chandler No way!
ross Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!

chandler Thanks.
anchorwoman While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
joey Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
pete Hi!
monica Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
pete Wow! Skates!
monica Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
pete Well...
monica Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
pete Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
monica Regular or decaf?
pete Ah, which ever is closest.
monica Okay.
pete So ask me what I did today.
monica So what did you do today Pete?
pete I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
monica What?! Oh.
monica Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
rachel What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
monica I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
rachel And you're still not attracted to him at all?
monica Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
rachel Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
monica Oh, please.
monica What? Honey.
rachel Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
monica Oh God, I'm so sorry.
rachel I know.
rachel Ow!!
monica Oh God!
ross Hey, you guys! Guess what?
rachel Got a job on a river boat?
ross Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
rachel Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
ross Right.
rachel Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
ross You like it right?
monica Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
rachel Yeah, come here!
monica What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
rachel Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
ross Okay, good bye!
chandler So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
phoebe Umm, oh, about three months.
chandler Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
joey Hey!!
chandler Hey!
joey I got you something! Open it! Open it!
chandler Okay. It's a chicken.
joey It's cute, huh?
phoebe Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
chandler Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
phoebe Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
joey Oh, well no problem there.
chandler Easy Lenny.
pete So? I mean have you thought about it?
monica Okay. Here's the thing.
pete Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
monica I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
pete Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
monica Huh?
pete No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
monica Oh?
pete Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
monica Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
pete I guess you can.
monica Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
pete All right.
monica Okay. Can you give me a little push?
pete Yeah, sure. Good luck!
monica I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
phoebe Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
pete What?
phoebe I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
pete Why would you say that?
phoebe 'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
pete You're good. You're good!
phoebe Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
pete Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
phoebe Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
pete Thanks a lot.
phoebe No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
chandler Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
joey Hey.

joey Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
chandler Excuse me?
joey What?
chandler I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
joey Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
chandler You don't think I get up when you get up?
joey Ohhh, here it comes.
chandler Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
joey Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
chandler And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
joey That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
chandler I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
joey I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
chandler I'll take her back tomorrow.
joey Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
ross Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
joey Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
ross Really?
rachel Oww!
ross Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
rachel Oww!

joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
chandler I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
chandler If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
joey Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
chandler Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
joey That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
chandler Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
chandler Ohhh-hoo, funny story!

pete Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
monica No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
pete Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
monica You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
pete What?
monica And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
pete Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
monica Okay, bye.
pete I'm sorry things didn't work out...
monica All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
