ross Hey!
rachel Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
ross Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
rachel Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
ross Oh yeah, why not?
rachel Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
ross Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
phoebe Always.
ross I didn't get the annulment.
phoebe What?!
ross We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
ross Hey, do you have any gum?
rachel Oh? Yeah! Sure!
phoebe Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
rachel Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
phoebe Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
rachel Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
phoebe Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
ross I know.
phoebe Ross?!
ross Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
phoebe Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
ross Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
phoebe So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
ross Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
phoebe Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
rachel Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
phoebe Hey Rach!
rachel What was that?!
phoebe Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
rachel I haven't seen it yet!
phoebe Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
rachel Noooooooo!!
chandler Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
monica Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
chandler No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
monica Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
chandler No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
monica Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
chandler Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
monica Pretty much.
chandler All right.
joey Hey Monica!
monica Hi!
joey Hey man, you feeling any better?
monica Joey, we have something to tell you.
joey Oh my God! You're pregnant!
chandler No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
joey Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
monica Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
joey Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
chandler Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
joey Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
monica Hey Pheebs!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey, have you seen Rachel?
phoebe No, why?
monica I have some pretty exciting news!
phoebe You're pregnant!
monica No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
phoebe Ooh! That's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.
ross Hey! Hi!
monica Hey!
ross What's up?
monica Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
ross Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
phoebe Guys, I'm happy too.
monica Okay, come here!
phoebe Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled
monica Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
ross Bye.
phoebe Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
ross Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
phoebe Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates
ross No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
phoebe Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
ross Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
phoebe Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
ross What?! Why?
phoebe Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
ross And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
chandler Hey!
monica Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
chandler What gave me away?
monica I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
chandler Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
monica No.
chandler Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
rachel Hey!
chandler Hey.
rachel Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
chandler Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
rachel I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
chandler Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty
rachel What?
chandler All yours babe.
monica Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
rachel Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
monica Really?!
rachel And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
monica Yes, we are.
rachel And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
chandler Rach
monica Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
rachel Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door
monica We'll be waiting for you
ross ...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
phoebe Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
stephanie Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
phoebe Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
karin Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out
phoebe Whatever! What about you Meg?
meg Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
ross What?!
phoebe She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
ross This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
phoebe Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
ross We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
phoebe Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
ross Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
phoebe Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
ross Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
meg Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
karin I am so attracted to him right now.
chandler Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
monica Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
chandler Well, Joey's my best friend.
monica I'm not your best friend?
chandler You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
monica All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
chandler Okay. Oh yes.
monica Hey!
chandler Hey-hey!
monica These aren't for you! Are you upset?
chandler I am now!
rachel Hey roomie!
chandler Okay, bye!
monica Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
rachel Are you pregnant?!
monica No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
rachel Um-hmm.
monica Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
rachel Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
monica Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
rachel Okay.
monica Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
rachel Sure? Thanks.
monica Maybe, do you need a tissue?
rachel Monica, where did you get these?!
monica I made them!
rachel Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
joey God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
chandler Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
joey Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
chandler Not once did we do that.
monica Hi.
chandler Hey!
joey Hi.
monica So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
chandler Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
monica Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
chandler And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
monica I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
joey Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
chandler Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
russell You got married again.
ross Yes.
russell So that's your second marriage in two years.
ross Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
russell Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
ross Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
russell I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
ross Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
russell Oh, that's better then.
ross This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
russell I see. Have you considered therapy?
ross I think just the annulment for today.
russell There are a couple of forms to fill out.
ross Easy.
russell And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
ross No problem.
russell And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
ross Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
russell Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
ross Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
rachel Hey!
monica Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
rachel Okay!
monica Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
rachel Okay.
monica Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
rachel What the hell is that?
monica I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
rachel Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
monica Something to remember me by!
rachel Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
monica But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
rachel Are you okay? You're not blinking.
monica I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
rachel Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
monica An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
rachel What is the matter with you?!
monica What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
rachel All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
monica What's hard to believe?
rachel Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
monica Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
rachel But I
monica No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
rachel It is? Really?
monica Yeah, sweetie.
rachel I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
monica No.
rachel What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
monica I'm gonna miss you!
rachel I mean it's the end of an era!
monica I know!
phoebe Okay, bye!
ross Oh no.
phoebe So? Did you get the annulment?
ross I couldn't.
phoebe I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
ross It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
phoebe Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
ross I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
phoebe I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
ross I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
ross Ohh, what's wrong?!
rachel Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
ross Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
rachel Thank you.
ross Of course.
joey So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
phoebe Oh we do, but not just yet.
joey Really?! Well, when?
phoebe Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
joey Wow.
phoebe I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
joey Great!
phoebe But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
joey Oh-oh, what about Ross?
phoebe I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
