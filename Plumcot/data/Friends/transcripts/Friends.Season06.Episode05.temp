rachel I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
ross Look I was going to tell you!
rachel When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
chandler What?
monica You're kidding!
phoebe Oh my God!!
monica Ross!
ross Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
chandler Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
ross Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
phoebe Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
ross Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
phoebe Another lie. You have a sickness!
chandler Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
joey Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber's note
gunther Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
joey Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
monica Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
joey There's a lost and found? My shoe!
chandler You left a shoe here?!
joey Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
chandler Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
joey Great! Thanks.
phoebe Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
monica Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
chandler Yeah, all right.
phoebe Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
chandler Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
phoebe Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
monica Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
chandler Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
monica Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when - - people with babies come to visit.
guy_1 Nice car!
joey Yeah, it's not mine.
woman I love your car.
joey Yeah, it's mine.
woman I bet it's fast.
joey Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
woman Yeah!
joey It's got 'em!
rachel So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
phoebe What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
rachel Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
phoebe Maybe you could be my roommate!
rachel Well there's an idea!!
phoebe Yeah!
rachel That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
phoebe Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
rachel December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
rachel Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
ross Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2
rachel Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
ross Okay Rach, but
rachel Op! You're peeping!
rachel Ross! Y'know what, I just got - why? Why did you do this?!
ross Look I told you
rachel I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
ross Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
rachel Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
ross What about the time I said we were on a break?
rachel Ugh!
monica Pheebs, how's it going?
phoebe I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
monica Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
chandler Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
phoebe Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
chandler See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
monica What do you mean?
chandler I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around
phoebe That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
chandler Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
monica This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
phoebe Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
joey Hey guys!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
chandler Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
joey You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
chandler What equity investments?
joey The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
monica Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
chandler You don't even have a car!
monica I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
chandler And?
monica And six others.
chandler There you are.
joey Yeah, she tops out at 130.
guy_2 Wow!
joey And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
guy_2 Really! You got a place upstate?
joey Sure!
guy_2 Well, I'll see you later.
joey Okay, take it easy.
the_porsche_owner Hey! That's my car.
joey Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
the_porsche_owner What-what are you doing?
joey Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
the_porsche_owner But it's my car!
joey Yeah, but it's my wax.
the_porsche_owner Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
joey Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
the_porsche_owner I'm not coming back.
joey Why not?
the_porsche_owner I live upstate.
joey Yeah, so did I.
phoebe I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
monica Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
chandler Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
monica Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
chandler He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
phoebe No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
chandler They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
phoebe What?!
chandler Glass, sand, whatever.
phoebe Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
monica Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
phoebe Oh, I can still do that.
monica How are you still single?!
chandler All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
monica Good. What made you change your mind?
chandler I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
phoebe How did that happen?!!
chandler Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
monica Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
judge Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
rachel Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
judge So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
ross Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
judge And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
ross What?!
rachel Uh yes, heroin and crack.
ross Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
rachel Well, you would know.
judge Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
ross Oh, come on!
rachel Ross, please, I found the magazines!
judge And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
ross Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
judge That won't be necessary.
ross And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
rachel Ugh!
judge Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
rachel Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
judge Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
rachel Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
judge Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
ross That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
rachel What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
ross And what - - What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
rachel Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
judge You need to get out of my chambers.
rachel All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
ross Yeah!
judge Would you like to spend the night in jail?
rachel And thank you for your time.
joey So the Porsche guy took his car back.
chandler But you found the keys to his clothes?
joey No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
monica And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
joey Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
chandler That is true.
phoebe Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
joey Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
monica Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
joey Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
chandler Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
monica All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
phoebe What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
monica The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
phoebe But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
monica He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
phoebe But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
chandler I think that's gum.
phoebe I'm pretty sure it's gun.
chandler Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
phoebe A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
joey Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
passerby Maybe because you've got the keys?
joey Porsche.
rachel This is totally your fault!
ross My fault?! You threatened the judge!
rachel Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
ross That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
joey Hi! How are the Gellers?
rachel Don't call us that!
ross The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
joey Hey! It's Porsche!!
phoebe Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now - who aren't there!
chandler Hey!
phoebe How do you feel?
chandler Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
phoebe Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
chandler And protected them from a tornado?
monica Oh my God.
phoebe I know, the babies are asleep.
monica Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
phoebe I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
monica But my apartment!
chandler Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
monica But the mess!
chandler Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
monica You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
chandler Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
rachel Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
ross I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
rachel Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
ross Y'know, I-I - you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
rachel Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
ross Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
rachel Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
ross Yeah! Right!
ross You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
rachel Nothing.
ross Okay, can we just sign please?
rachel Uh-hmm.
ross Congratulations.
rachel Okay Ross, we're - wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
ross What?
rachel Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
ross Excuse me?
rachel Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
ross Yeah?
rachel And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
ross So then if-if - I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
rachel Yeah, don't push it though.
ross I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
rachel I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
ross Did I, did I even treat?
rachel No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
ross That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
rachel Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
ross Eh, no problem.
rachel I'm gonna need a copy of those.
ross Totally.
joey Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
woman Hi Joey.
joey Hey! How you doin'?
woman He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
joey I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
