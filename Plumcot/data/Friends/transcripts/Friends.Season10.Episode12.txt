phoebe_buffay Oh, hey Joey.
joey_tribbiani Uh, hey.
phoebe_buffay Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
joey_tribbiani So he can't come?
phoebe_buffay No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
joey_tribbiani Seriously?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
joey_tribbiani I am pretty wisdomous.
phoebe_buffay So... what do you say?
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
phoebe_buffay Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
joey_tribbiani Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
phoebe_buffay Oh.
joey_tribbiani Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
monica_geller Well, it matters to me!
phoebe_buffay Well, I don't care, so you pick!
monica_geller Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
phoebe_buffay Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
monica_geller You don't know military time?
phoebe_buffay Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
monica_geller Just subtract twelve.
phoebe_buffay Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
monica_geller Six o'clock!
phoebe_buffay Ok.
monica_geller Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
phoebe_buffay Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
monica_geller Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
phoebe_buffay What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
monica_geller Ooh... she backed out.
phoebe_buffay She did? Why?
monica_geller I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
phoebe_buffay Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
phoebe_buffay Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
chandler_bing No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
phoebe_buffay Rehearse it!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
mike_hannigan Thanks for coming you guys.
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
mike_hannigan Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
dr_ross_geller That is why!
mike_hannigan Yeah.
phoebe_buffay So Rach.
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Where is Emma?
rachel_green Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
monica_geller Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
bitsy_hannigan Yes, we are.
joey_tribbiani Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
theodore_hannigan How's that?
joey_tribbiani You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
theodore_hannigan Who in God's name are you?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
chandler_bing You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
rachel_green Uh... November?
dr_ross_geller I wanna say it's not looking good.
rachel_green Hey Pheebs...
phoebe_buffay What's up?
rachel_green Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
chandler_bing Heh.
phoebe_buffay Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
dr_ross_geller Oh, man!
chandler_bing This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
dr_ross_geller FOOTBALL!
chandler_bing Thank you.
monica_geller Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
phoebe_buffay Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
monica_geller Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
phoebe_buffay I don't have a fax machine.
monica_geller Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
chandler_bing I know, I hate being left out of things.
dr_ross_geller And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
mike_hannigan Hey guys, how is it going?
chandler_bing Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
mike_hannigan Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
chandler_bing What happened?
dr_ross_geller Who cares, AND?
mike_hannigan ..and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...
dr_ross_geller I'll do it!
chandler_bing M-Me-me-me!
mike_hannigan You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
chandler_bing Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
dr_ross_geller No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?
mike_hannigan You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
dr_ross_geller Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
chandler_bing Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
dr_ross_geller Please, you're going down!
chandler_bing You are going downer!
dr_ross_geller Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
chandler_bing I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
joey_tribbiani So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
mike_hannigan Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
mike_hannigan I intend to marry her.
joey_tribbiani Oh, a wiseacre. No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
mike_hannigan No more so than acting.
joey_tribbiani Strike two!
mike_hannigan You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
joey_tribbiani Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
dr_ross_geller So, what did you decide?
phoebe_buffay I decided to pee.
chandler_bing Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
chandler_bing Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
rachel_green Goody, what is it!
phoebe_buffay Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
rachel_green What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
phoebe_buffay All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
dr_ross_geller I'll do it!
monica_geller Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
mike_hannigan Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
monica_geller You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
mike_hannigan Is that what you say to Chandler?
monica_geller It's 2101 and I am not amused. Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
phoebe_buffay Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
monica_geller oh God.
phoebe_buffay And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Happy wedding day!
phoebe_buffay Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
rachel_green Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
joey_tribbiani Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
monica_geller Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
monica_geller Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
phoebe_buffay Wow, this is a lot!
monica_geller Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
phoebe_buffay You won awards?
monica_geller Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Where's Rach?
monica_geller She's in her room, why?
dr_ross_geller I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
rachel_green What d'you want?
dr_ross_geller You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
rachel_green Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
dr_ross_geller I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
rachel_green Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
dr_ross_geller Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
rachel_green Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
dr_ross_geller YES, YES!
phoebe_buffay Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
monica_geller I know.
mike_hannigan Hey.
phoebe_buffay Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
mike_hannigan Orchids?
phoebe_buffay Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
joey_tribbiani Hello Michael.
mike_hannigan Joseph.
joey_tribbiani May I have a word with you, please?
mike_hannigan This is... great...
joey_tribbiani Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
mike_hannigan Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
joey_tribbiani More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
mike_hannigan Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
joey_tribbiani I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
mike_hannigan Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
joey_tribbiani That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
mike_hannigan That must have been one lousy movie.
joey_tribbiani That was ME!
rachel_green Hi
chandler_bing Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
rachel_green Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
chandler_bing Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
rachel_green All right fine, I pick you.
chandler_bing Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
rachel_green Oh my...
phoebe_buffay No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
joey_tribbiani I'm glad we had this little talk.
mike_hannigan Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Bye.
mike_hannigan Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, what's it doing here?
monica_geller Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
joey_tribbiani How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
chandler_bing How's it going?
dr_ross_geller Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
chandler_bing That's what I was doing too.
dr_ross_geller Well, you have fun tonight.
chandler_bing You too.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I will.
chandler_bing Me too.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
chandler_bing I'm not supposed to tell you.
dr_ross_geller I'm not supposed to tell you!
chandler_bing You told us both we could be in the wedding?
rachel_green Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
dr_ross_geller Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
chandler_bing Rach, Rach, knock knock.
rachel_green Who's there?
chandler_bing I'll tell you at the wedding.
rachel_green Uh.
mike_hannigan Hey, I forgot my scarf.
rachel_green You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
mike_hannigan Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
dr_ross_geller What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
rachel_green Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
phoebe_buffay Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
monica_geller How's it going?
phoebe_buffay Help me.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
monica_geller Really?
phoebe_buffay Please?
monica_geller You really want me to come back?
phoebe_buffay More than I wanna get married.
monica_geller Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
joey_tribbiani Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
phoebe_buffay About what?
joey_tribbiani The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
monica_geller Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
joey_tribbiani I don't think they are.
dr_ross_geller Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
monica_geller Well, the club lost it's power.
joey_tribbiani Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
rachel_green Since when do you watch the news?
joey_tribbiani Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
phoebe_buffay I know.
rachel_green Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
phoebe_buffay What?
rachel_green Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
phoebe_buffay What do you think?
mike_hannigan I think I wanna get married to you today.
phoebe_buffay Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
monica_geller AFFIRMATIVE!
monica_geller OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
bitsy_hannigan Michael!
mike_hannigan Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! Hi! Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
bitsy_hannigan No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
theodore_hannigan I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... Come on, sweetheart.
mike_hannigan You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
chandler_bing So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
mike_hannigan I guess.
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing I'll do it!
dr_ross_geller No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
chandler_bing I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
dr_ross_geller Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
monica_geller Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
mike_hannigan Oh, no!
joey_tribbiani Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
monica_geller Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
dr_ross_geller Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
joey_tribbiani I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
monica_geller Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
chandler_bing I'll do it.
dr_ross_geller I'll...
chandler_bing Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
monica_geller Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
monica_geller Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
monica_geller So, you're ready to do this?
phoebe_buffay Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
rachel_green Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
phoebe_buffay Oh, thank you.
monica_geller I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
phoebe_buffay I love you guys.
monica_geller@rachel_green I love you.
monica_geller Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
chandler_bing Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
monica_geller I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
chandler_bing Oh yeah!
monica_geller Okay Marjorie, hit it.
rachel_green Geez Ross, you could have showered.
dr_ross_geller It's the dog.
monica_geller Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
chandler_bing Ready?
phoebe_buffay Okay.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
chandler_bing Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
phoebe_buffay I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
chandler_bing You look beautiful.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
mike_hannigan My God! Aren't you freezing?
phoebe_buffay Na-ah.
joey_tribbiani Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
joey_tribbiani Okay...
phoebe_buffay When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family.
mike_hannigan Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
phoebe_buffay Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
mike_hannigan I love you too.
dr_ross_geller Uh Joey...
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
joey_tribbiani Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
phoebe_buffay I do.
joey_tribbiani Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
mike_hannigan I do.
joey_tribbiani I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
phoebe_buffay I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
chandler_bing That really was an incredible wedding.
joey_tribbiani It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
chandler_bing I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
joey_tribbiani Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
chandler_bing I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
dr_ross_geller Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
