joey All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
rachel Hi, sweetie.
joey Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
monica Hi.
chandler Are you, are you high?
monica I just had the most amazing bath.
chandler Really? I don't like baths.
monica Wait, you like them with me.
chandler Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
monica Oh, baths are so relaxing!
chandler Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
monica How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
chandler Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
joey Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
chandler Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
joey Well, neither.
chandler Oh my God, what's up?!
joey I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
chandler Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
joey All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
chandler Do you?
joey It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
chandler In London?
joey Yeah.
chandler Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
joey You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
chandler If that.
rachel Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
ross Right.
phoebe Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
ross No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
rachel Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
ross And smart!
rachel Popular.
ross With an aptitude for science.
phoebe Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
rachel Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
ross Really? Me too!
phoebe Me too!
rachel Really?!
phoebe Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
ross Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
rachel Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
ross Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
rachel Okay fine, what do you have?
ross Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.
rachel Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
phoebe Yeah, by Sandrine.
ross You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
rachel I'm really, really not.
phoebe How-how about you each get five vetoes?
ross All right.
rachel All right.
ross That sounds fair.
rachel Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
ross Veto.
rachel Why?
ross Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
phoebe I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
ross Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
rachel Ross, why do you hate our child?
ross Fine, you go.
rachel Okay, James.
ross Huh.
rachel But only if it's a girl.
ross Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
rachel Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
ross Veto. Stewart?
rachel Veto. Sawyer?
ross Veto. Helen?
rachel Veto.
phoebe Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
chandler Hey.
monica Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
chandler Sex on the balcony?
monica No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
chandler What is it?
monica I drew you a bath!
chandler Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
monica Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!
chandler Well, this does butch it up a bit.
monica I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
chandler All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
monica Absolutely.
monica Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
chandler All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
monica So?
chandler Oh my God.
monica I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
chandler I'm going to need a bigger boat.
ross I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
rachel Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
dr_long Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
ross Uh, no. No, we're not.
rachel But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
dr_long That's right. But if you don't want to know
ross No, no, we want to wait, right?
rachel Right. Right.
dr_long Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo.
rachel So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
ross What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
rachel Third one from the left?
ross Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!
rachel What?!
ross You're looking!
rachel I didn't!
ross I saw you!
rachel Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
ross Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
rachel Okay, but Ross just listen to me
ross No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
rachel But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
ross Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
rachel Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
monica Hello?
chandler I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
monica You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
chandler I'm in the bathtub.
monica Oh. What's wrong?
chandler I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!
monica What?
chandler The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
monica Okay, let's talk about something else.
chandler Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
monica Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and
chandler I had the exact same conversation.
monica You did? What was he talking about?
chandler I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
monica That was a long night.
chandler All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
monica Okay, he was talking about rules.
chandler Uh-huh.
monica Umm, and looking at people differently.
chandler He didn't say anything about that to me.
monica What did he tell you?
chandler He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
monica Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
chandler But what did he mean by rules?
monica Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
chandler Because he was looking at her differently.
monica And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
chandler My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
phoebe You guys?
monica Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!
chandler You don't say anything.
monica Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
chandler I'm not going to let you say anything.
monica You just stay here!
chandler Oh, God!
phoebe Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
monica Oh, you had that?
phoebe Uh-huh.
monica I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
phoebe Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
phoebe What?
monica Nothing.
phoebe Okay.
monica I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
phoebe Fine.
monica It's a humdinger!
phoebe Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
monica Somebody likes you!
phoebe Is it Chandler?
monica No!
phoebe Well, then tell him to stop staring!
monica It's Joey!
phoebe Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
monica Is it something you'd be interested in?
phoebe I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.
monica I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
phoebe Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
monica Not Chandler, just Joey.
phoebe Sure.
rachel Hey.
ross Hey.
rachel You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
ross Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
rachel I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
ross I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
rachel I would-Sequoia?
ross Veto.
rachel Fine.
ross Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
rachel But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
ross Not like this!
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey. Well, what's up?
phoebe Umm, Joey, I know.
joey What?
phoebe I knooow.
joey Whaaat?
phoebe I know about your feelings.
joey Oh my God. You do?
phoebe Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
joey I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
phoebe For God sakes, it's Rachel!
joey I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
phoebe Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
joey What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
phoebe Yeah.
joey She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
phoebe Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
joey You think?
phoebe Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
joey Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
phoebe That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
joey Not really.
phoebe Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
ross So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
rachel What?
ross That's right. The student has become the master.
rachel Ross, I swear, I don't know.
ross Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
rachel A what?!
ross You really didn't know?
rachel We're having a girl?
ross No.
rachel That's what you just said!
ross No.
rachel You said girl!
ross Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
rachel I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
ross I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
rachel Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth
ross Permission to veto.
rachel Yes, please.
monica Hey.
chandler Do I smell essential oils?
monica Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
chandler Okay.
monica What do you think you're doing?
chandler L-leaving my troubles behind?
monica I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
chandler Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
monica Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
chandler You told her?!
monica She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
phoebe Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
monica What?
phoebe Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
monica I don't think I'd care.
phoebe Really? Lee Majors is hot!
joey Hello?
phoebe We're in the bathroom!
joey Why?
chandler Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
joey What are you guys doing in here?
monica Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!
chandler You like Rachel?!
joey It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
phoebe Mazel tov.
rachel Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
monica Honey, cover it up with the boat!
ross Hello?
chandler Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
ross Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
rachel No, I was waiting for you!
phoebe Tell us what?
rachel We're having a girl.
all Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
chandler I'll...I'll get you later!
joey All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
rachel Hi, sweetie.
joey I love you.
monica It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
chandler Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
monica I'm not touching you.
chandler You're not?
monica It's the salts.
chandler Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
monica Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
