monica Come in. I've been waiting for you.
rachel Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
monica Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
rachel Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
monica Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
rachel That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
monica Uh-huh, that one!
rachel Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
monica Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
rachel Why aren't you guys at the movie?
joey Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
ross I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
joey He's talking to London!
monica But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
joey Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
ross I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
joey Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
chandler Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
joey Hey!
chandler Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
joey Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
monica Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
joey Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
monica Oh that's great!
joey A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
phoebe Ugh, PBS!
monica What's wrong with PBS?
phoebe Ugh, what's right with them?
joey Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
phoebe Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
chandler Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
phoebe All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
joey I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
phoebe This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
joey Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
phoebe What-what are you talking about?!
joey Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
phoebe Yeah. So?
joey It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
phoebe Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
joey Well, may I ask for one example?
phoebe Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
joey That's because all people are selfish.
phoebe Are you calling me selfish?!
joey Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
phoebe I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
ross Hello.
emily Hello, Ross?
ross Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
emily Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
ross No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
emily Really? About what?
ross Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
emily I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
ross She's talking.
all Yay!
phoebe Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
joey That he doesn't exist.
phoebe Right.
rachel So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
chandler Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
rachel So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
monica Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
chandler Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
rachel I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
chandler Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
monica I might've said that. Why is that funny?
chandler Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
ross Hi!
monica Hey!
ross Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
chandler Yes!
monica That's great!
ross In London!
monica What?!
ross She wants me to move to London.
monica But you live here! You know that.
rachel What-what-what are you gonna do?
ross I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
monica Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
ross It could happen.
joey How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
stage_director This will be your phone.
joey That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
stage_director No you answer it and take pledges.
joey But I'm the host!
stage_director No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
joey You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
stage_director Well, here's your phone doctor.
phoebe I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
rachel Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
phoebe I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
chandler Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
monica Sure!
chandler If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
rachel Chandler! Is he?
monica Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
chandler Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
ross All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
emily I understand that would be difficult.
ross Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
emily I don't know, it's just
ross Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
emily All right.
ross All right, did you just say all right?
emily I did. Now I'm the idiot.
ross Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
emily Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
ross Yes, tell me.
emily Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
ross I know. I am, I am so sorry.
emily And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
ross Again, very sorry.
emily I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
ross Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
emily All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
ross Oh that is so great! That's
emily As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
ross So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
chandler Yes!
phoebe Ooh-ohh!
monica Great!
ross No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
phoebe Why?
monica What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
ross I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
chandler Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
monica Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
phoebe Yeah.
chandler That's true!
phoebe Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
chandler That's true!
monica No, you cannot.
ross Thanks for the help, problem solved.
monica Hello.
joey Hey Mon!
monica Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
joey See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
monica You're not on TV.
joey Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
chandler Hey, there he is! There he is!
joey Hello New York!
emeril Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
chandler How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
monica Hi Chandler.
chandler Hey!
monica Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
chandler Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
monica William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
chandler Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
monica Yeah, so?
chandler Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
monica Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
chandler Why?
monica Why?
chandler What's your point?
joey PBS telethon.
phoebe Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
joey What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
phoebe Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
joey Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
phoebe Aw, dammit!
stage_director Back on in 30 seconds people!
joey Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
pbs_volunteer Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
joey Come on man! You've been here all day!
pbs_volunteer Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
stage_director We're on in 3, 2,
gary_collins Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to
ross Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
monica A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
phoebe Ooh, it's not a toy.
ross Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
monica All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
joey PBS Telethon.
phoebe Hi Joey.
joey Hey Pheebs!
phoebe I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
joey $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
phoebe Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
joey And you don't a little good about donating the money?
phoebe No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
joey A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
phoebe Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
gary_collins It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
phoebe Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
chandler Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
monica Keep talking.
chandler I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
monica Really?
chandler Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
monica Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
chandler Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
monica But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
chandler Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
monica Yeah.
chandler All right, let's show them how it's done.
monica Okay.
monica Ow!
chandler Y'know that wasn't part of it?
monica I know!
rachel Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
ross For what?
rachel For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
ross Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
rachel Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
ross It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
rachel Like what?
ross Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
rachel Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
ross No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
rachel Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
ross Thanks.
rachel Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
ross Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
monica Never done that before.
chandler Nope.
