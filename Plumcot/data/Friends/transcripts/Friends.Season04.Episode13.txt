chandler_bing Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
dr_ross_geller People can hear you.
chandler_bing I know!!
chandler_bing Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
kathys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode13 Hi!
kathy Hi!
dr_ross_geller That is one good looking man!
chandler_bing Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
kathys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode13 Sooo, you've been doing this long?
kathy No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
kathys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode13 Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
dr_ross_geller Dude!
kathys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode13 Is that an expensive blouse?
kathy If you want it to be.
dr_ross_geller Here's your girlfriend's button.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
monica_geller Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
phoebe_buffay Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
monica_geller Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
rachel_green Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
monica_geller Oh my God, are you out of a job?
rachel_green No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
phoebe_buffay Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay That sounds great!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
joey_tribbiani There's gravy?
monica_geller If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
monica_geller What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani I think I left a donut up here.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
dr_ross_geller Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
chandler_bing Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
phoebe_buffay That's a good idea for a business!
chandler_bing I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
joey_tribbiani That-that is a good trick.
chandler_bing All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
joey_tribbiani Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
joey_tribbiani Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
dr_ross_geller They're not a couple!
phoebe_buffay Oh-okay, I get the game now.
joey_tribbiani Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah!
joey_tribbiani Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
chandler_bing Really?
joey_tribbiani Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
dr_ross_geller No.
joey_tribbiani Noooo!!
chandler_bing So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
chandler_bing Yeah, I know but
dr_ross_geller Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
monica_geller You made pancakes?
joey_tribbiani Yep! Grab a plate.
monica_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
chandler_bing Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
joey_tribbiani Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah!
monica_geller Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, who's playing?
monica_geller The players.
dr_ross_geller Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
monica_geller Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
joey_tribbiani All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
phoebe_buffay Oh.
rachel_green Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
mr_waltham In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
rachel_green Hi!
joshua_burgin Hi, I'm Joshua.
rachel_green Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
joshua_burgin Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife
rachel_green Oh, I'm so sorry.
joshua_burgin Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
rachel_green Well, at least that's a great suit.
joshua_burgin Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
rachel_green Okay.
mr_waltham Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
rachel_green No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
rachel_green Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
joshua_burgin It's this way? Sorry.
chandler_bing I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
dr_ross_geller All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
chandler_bing Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
dr_ross_geller Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
kathy Hey you guys!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
kathy Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
dr_ross_geller Oh, absolutely!
kathy Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
kathy It's a good play, isn't it?
chandler_bing Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I
kathy Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
chandler_bing Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
kathy Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
chandler_bing Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
kathy Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
chandler_bing Well, you can understand, given how we started.
kathy Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
chandler_bing Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
kathy I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
chandler_bing Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
rachel_green I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
phoebe_buffay Rachel has a new doll.
rachel_green Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
dr_ross_geller Uh, hello!
rachel_green Hi-e!!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, what do I smell?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, it smells good.
monica_geller Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
phoebe_buffay Ooh!
monica_geller Please, have some!
dr_ross_geller Oh, yumm!
monica_geller Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
joey_tribbiani Wow! The new Playboy!
monica_geller Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
dr_ross_geller Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
phoebe_buffay What? What?
rachel_green Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
rachel_green It's Joshua.
dr_ross_geller Oh, whatever.
monica_geller Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
phoebe_buffay Well, I hate to eat and run, but
monica_geller No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I don't need it.
monica_geller People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
rachel_green Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
monica_geller I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
phoebe_buffay Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
monica_geller 'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
phoebe_buffay If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
rachel_green Yeah, that's true.
monica_geller All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
phoebe_buffay Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
chandler_bing Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
all@ What?!
dr_ross_geller So you were right?
chandler_bing I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
dr_ross_geller Chandler!
rachel_green Chandler, what did she say?
phoebe_buffay Wait a minute.
joey_tribbiani Come here.
monica_geller Are you sure?
chandler_bing Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's
rachel_green Beefsteak Charlie's?
chandler_bing Yes! See you and I have always been like-
rachel_green Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
monica_geller Nah, I got it.
rachel_green Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
rachel_green Hi!
all@ Hey!
rachel_green So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
phoebe_buffay Why don't you ask him out?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
rachel_green Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
joey_tribbiani Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
phoebe_buffay He just got a divorce right?
rachel_green Hmm-mmm.
phoebe_buffay So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
rachel_green Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
phoebe_buffay You've never asked a guy out?!!
rachel_green No. Have you?
phoebe_buffay Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
rachel_green I don't even know how I would go about it.
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
phoebe_buffay Oh, please!
joey_tribbiani Hey, how you doin'?
rachel_green You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
phoebe_buffay I've never done that.
rachel_green Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
joey_tribbiani Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
rachel_green Really?! You think that will work?
joey_tribbiani Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
joey_tribbiani What the heck is that?
chandler_bing Did she call?
phoebe_buffay No, sorry.
chandler_bing All right, maybe I should call her.
joey_tribbiani No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
dr_ross_geller He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
chandler_bing Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
dr_ross_geller How might you be wrong?
chandler_bing Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
joey_tribbiani Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
chandler_bing She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
dr_ross_geller That's all you're basing this on?
chandler_bing That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
chandler_bing Oh my God!!
rachel_green Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
joshua_burgin What do you think?
rachel_green Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
joshua_burgin Huh. Yeah?
rachel_green Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
joshua_burgin I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
rachel_green Great.
joshua_burgin All right, thank you so much for all your help.
rachel_green Sure.
joshua_burgin Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
rachel_green Yeah-eah-ha!
joshua_burgin Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
rachel_green Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
joshua_burgin Ah, that's okay, thanks.
rachel_green Okay.
joshua_burgin Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
rachel_green Basketball!
joshua_burgin I'm sorry.
rachel_green I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
joshua_burgin Wow! That would be great.
rachel_green Really?
joshua_burgin Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
mr_waltham Good morning.
joshua_burgin Hi!
kathy Hey.
chandler_bing Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
kathy Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
chandler_bing Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
kathy Yeah.
chandler_bing Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
joey_tribbiani Okay, for next time, what do you say?
rachel_green I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
dr_ross_geller So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
rachel_green He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
monica_geller Okay, it's ready. Come on.
joey_tribbiani What's ready?
monica_geller Just come.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
rachel_green Wow! Monica!
phoebe_buffay Great!
dr_ross_geller This is beautiful!
phoebe_buffay Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
monica_geller Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, it looks the same.
monica_geller You used to have carpet.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah!
monica_geller So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
dr_ross_geller Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
monica_geller Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani How'd it go?
chandler_bing Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
phoebe_buffay Oh good!
chandler_bing She is now.
dr_ross_geller What are you saying?
chandler_bing I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
phoebe_buffay How? How is your fault?
chandler_bing Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
rachel_green Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
dr_ross_geller Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
mr_waltham Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
rachel_green Really?
mr_waltham Will you call him?
rachel_green Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
