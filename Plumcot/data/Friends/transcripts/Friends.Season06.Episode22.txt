phoebe_buffay Hi, you guys.
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hi!
rachel_green What's the matter?
phoebe_buffay Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
joey_tribbiani Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
phoebe_buffay No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
chandler_bing I'll give up my ticket.
joey_tribbiani Me too.
phoebe_buffay Okay that's so generous!
chandler_bing And I think Ross is generous too.
phoebe_buffay Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
monica_geller@rachel_green Great.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green So what-what is the exhibit.
phoebe_buffay It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
joey_tribbiani Oh man!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
dr_ross_geller Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
monica_geller Oh that's great!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
dr_ross_geller Why? What?
monica_geller Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
dr_ross_geller No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
rachel_green I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
chandler_bing Ross.
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and
paul_stevens Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
dr_ross_geller Really? That okay, that's great.
paul_stevens Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
dr_ross_geller All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
paul_stevens Yes it does.
dr_ross_geller But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
paul_stevens I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
dr_ross_geller Ohh! A man with a plan!
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
joey_tribbiani I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll
phoebe_buffay Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
joey_tribbiani Hey! So I'm back.
the_dry_cleaner Who are you?
joey_tribbiani Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
the_dry_cleaner Show me in the table.
joey_tribbiani Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
the_dry_cleaner Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
joey_tribbiani Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
phoebe_buffay So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
monica_geller Oh, I love museums!
rachel_green Umm.
monica_geller Soakin' up all the culture.
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller Where do you want to start?
rachel_green Ooh, the gift shop!
monica_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Hey, and then lunch.
rachel_green Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
phoebe_buffay Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
rachel_green What?! No! Why?!
phoebe_buffay No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
the_museum_official You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
rachel_green I didn't know you could get married here.
monica_geller This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
the_museum_official May I help you?
rachel_green Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
the_museum_official Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
rachel_green Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
monica_geller What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
rachel_green Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
monica_geller Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
rachel_green I'm gonna do it too!
phoebe_buffay Me too!
rachel_green Really? Who would, who would you marry?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
rachel_green Oh Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
monica_geller Phoebe, that stuff is
phoebe_buffay Don't even get me started on yours!
joey_tribbiani Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
the_dry_cleaner I did.
joey_tribbiani All right, let's get me back up there!
the_dry_cleaner No! It don't go up on the wall!
joey_tribbiani What-But you saw the show!
the_dry_cleaner Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
joey_tribbiani Dry cleaners?
the_dry_cleaner Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
joey_tribbiani Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
the_dry_cleaner That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
joey_tribbiani Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
the_dry_cleaner I've never seen it!
joey_tribbiani Oh you should, it's great.
dr_ross_geller This place is really beautiful!
elizabeth_stevens Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
dr_ross_geller Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
elizabeth_stevens Sure!

dr_ross_geller Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
elizabeth_stevens Well, whatever works for ya
dr_ross_geller No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
elizabeth_stevens Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
elizabeth_stevens Hey umm, you brought protection right?
dr_ross_geller Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.

dr_ross_geller And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
paul_stevens Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
elizabeth_stevens Daddy!
paul_stevens You're next!!
elizabeth_stevens Okay. I didn't know he was here.
paul_stevens Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
dr_ross_geller Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
paul_stevens No, let me explain! Fired!!
dr_ross_geller All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
paul_stevens What?
dr_ross_geller And I too am just a love machine.
paul_stevens Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
monica_geller I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
chandler_bing I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
monica_geller Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
chandler_bing Right here!
monica_geller Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
chandler_bing Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
monica_geller It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready
monica_geller I know! I know.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
phoebe_buffay Hey, did she buy it?
chandler_bing Totally.
phoebe_buffay So did Heldi show you the place?
chandler_bing Yeah, it's beautiful.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
chandler_bing I know.
joey_tribbiani Hey Gunther.
gunther Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
gunther Do you still work here?
joey_tribbiani No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
gunther Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
joey_tribbiani Great!
