ross You said you'd marry Joey?
rachel Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! I'm not helping.
ross So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
rachel That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
ross So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
rachel Well - Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
ross Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my - No! Ah!
rachel Ooooo!
joey Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
ross Rachel said she'd marry you?!
joey This isn't the right room, sorry folks.
monica Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
phoebe No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
monica So sexy. Honey.
chandler Yea yea.
monica Honey why don't you go lie down.
chandler No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
joey Why're you so tired?
chandler Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep.  Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
joey You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
rachel Hi!
everyone Hi, welcome home!
monica Phoebe did the signs!
rachel Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
phoebe Look at all the stuff people sent!
rachel Oh Ah! Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think... Oh you guys I love it.
joey Hey so where's Ross?
rachel He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
joey Is he still mad at us?
rachel Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
joey That's not fair! I can't do that.
rachel Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
joey See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now.
chandler Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
ms_mckenna The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
ms_mckenna Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I'll go straight to my forty two point plan.
chandler Walter .
phoebe She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
monica Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
ross Okay I put most of the stuff away.
rachel Oh great, the pacifiers?
ross In the closet.
rachel The burping clogs?
ross Linen closet.
rachel The diapers?
ross In the hospital.
phoebe Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
ross No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
rachel Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
ross Sure what kind?
rachel Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
ross Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
rachel Blueberry.
ross Blueberry it is.
rachel Thanks.
monica Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
rachel God how long do you think that's gonna last?
phoebe I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
rachel Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.
phoebe You know that's... that's her.
rachel Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
phoebe Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
rachel Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
phoebe I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
rachel Oh I'm sorry mummy's so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep
monica Breaks your heart doesn't it
phoebe It really does... how long do you think we have to stay?
ms_mckenna Ok if everyone's on board, it's settled, Chandler, Chandler?
chandler Yep.
ms_mckenna Are you on board?
chandler Yes.
ms_mckenna Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa. You're gonna love Oklahoma.
phoebe Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
monica Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
rachel Ok.
monica It worked!
rachel Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
monica Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
rachel Yeah, I'm not so sure.
monica Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
phoebe Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
ross Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
gunther Diapers huh?
ross Yep.
gunther So I guess Rachel had you baby?
ross Yep, can you believe it?
gunther Nope!  I still can't believe she slept with you in the first place.
ross Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?
joey Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
ross Ah actually we don't.
joey Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong.
ross What! You didn't do anything wrong?!
joey I said I didn't technically.
ross Okay let's put aside that you "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
joey Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?
ross And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
joey I know I should've. "I'm sorry."
ross Not using it right, Joe.
ross I'm gonna go.
joey No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
ross Give me the bag.
joey No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
ross Joey!
joey You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
ross I'm not gonna hit you.
joey Why not?  You'll feel better!  I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
ross No I don't.
joey A little bit.

ross You ducked!!

ross Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
joey I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
ross What is the matter with you?!?
joey You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
ross Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
joey Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
monica Try feeding her again.
rachel I already fed her.
monica I know, that's why I said again!
phoebe Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?  That's just what she wants.
chandler Hey.
monica Hey.
chandler Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
rachel Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
phoebe Oh I'm kinda part of this.
chandler Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
phoebe I knew I should have married Chandler.
monica Okay what's up
chandler Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
monica Oh yeah .
chandler Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
monica What? Who says that?
chandler People who've never ever been to Paris.
monica What's going on?
chandler We're moving to Tulsa!
monica Excuse me?
chandler Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
monica Tulsa, Oklahoma!
chandler The Sooner State, whatever that is.
monica Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
chandler Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
monica Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
chandler No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it.
monica Thank you.
chandler What is wrong with Emma?
monica Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
chandler Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
ms_mckenna What?
chandler It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
ms_mckenna You fell asleep?
chandler But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy - Please don't make me go there!
ms_mckenna Chandler, I
chandler No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa.
joey Hey, so how is it?
ross I broke my thumb.
joey Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
ross You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
joey You, you want me to help you with that?
ross Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
joey Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
ross Just Ross!
joey It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
ross You know my birthday.
joey Sure, May...tember.
ross October 18th.
joey Occupation? Dinosaurs.
ross Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.
joey Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
ross Ah, Rachel I guess.
joey Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
ross Just ah... just put roommate.
joey Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?
ross I don't think that we are.
joey But you two were supposed to be together.
ross Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
joey Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
ross Yeah that's what she said.
joey So?
ross So I don't wanna be just anybody.
joey Wow.
ross You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
joey Really?
ross Yeah.
joey And you're Okay with that?
ross Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That's why they call them plans.  Hello? I'm fine.
joey Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
ross Hey there you go!
joey "Thanks."
rachel Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
monica About a week and a half.
phoebe Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
monica Rach, try holding her a different way.
rachel You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
phoebe Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
rachel Here you go.
phoebe Shh! Nothing works with this child!
rachel Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
monica You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
rachel Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
monica Okay I'll take her, here.
rachel I have to go to the bathroom.
phoebe I have to go scream into a pillow.
monica Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
phoebe Have I gone deaf?
monica It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
phoebe You must be a fireball in bed.
monica I can't believe it!  She's asleep!  I got her to go to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!
phoebe I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
rachel Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
monica Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt
rachel You are the official baby crier stopper!
monica Yes I am!!
rachel You're never leaving the apartment!
monica Say what?
rachel That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
monica Oh no no no no!
phoebe Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months .
rachel Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.

chandler Oh so there can't be any yelling.
monica No.
chandler We're moving to Tulsa
monica What!?
chandler Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you.
ross Hey.
rachel Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
ross Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
rachel Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
ross Okay.
rachel You know what I really really want?
ross What, Rach?
rachel I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
ross Right.
rachel I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.
ross Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?
rachel No its really okay... Monica!
monica Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
joey You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.
chandler Hey, what you guys talking about?
joey Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?
