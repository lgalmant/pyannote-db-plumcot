chandler_bing Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
rachel_green That's a good story, Grandpa.
dr_ross_geller Hey
all@ Hey
dr_ross_geller Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
monica_geller Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
phoebe_buffay That is nice and we're done. TADA!
chandler_bing I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
monica_geller Oh, here.
chandler_bing See now it feels like Christmas!
dr_ross_geller ... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
rachel_green So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
joey_tribbiani Hey you guys.
chandler_bing Hey Joe what's up?
joey_tribbiani I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like
chandler_bing I can see why that's hard to resist.
joey_tribbiani I like her so much!
monica_geller Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
joey_tribbiani I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
chandler_bing You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
dr_ross_geller I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
janine_lecroix Hey guys!
dr_ross_geller Hi Janine!
janine_lecroix I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
monica_geller Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
janine_lecroix Yeah, that's what I said.
monica_geller Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
chandler_bing Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
janine_lecroix Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
dr_ross_geller You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
janine_lecroix Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
joey_tribbiani Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
janine_lecroix Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
dr_ross_geller Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
janine_lecroix Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
dr_ross_geller Are you serious?
monica_geller We are there!
chandler_bing What, what are you laughing at?
rachel_green Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
janine_lecroix Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
all@ Bye!
dr_ross_geller Bye Janine!
joey_tribbiani Did she just ask me out on a date?
chandler_bing I don't think so.
monica_geller What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
rachel_green Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
rachel_green Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
dr_ross_geller It was a dry day.
monica_geller We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
monica_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember - stay cool.
dr_ross_geller Got it!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 OK, everyone gather up.
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller 'Scuse us
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
joey_tribbiani Ross! So when is it gonna air?
rachel_green Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
chandler_bing I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
rachel_green We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
chandler_bing What? That's terrible!
phoebe_buffay No-no, we do it every year!
chandler_bing Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
phoebe_buffay No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
rachel_green Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
chandler_bing No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
phoebe_buffay But we have to!
chandler_bing No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
phoebe_buffay Well then, you should look with us.
chandler_bing Why?
rachel_green Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
chandler_bing No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
phoebe_buffay Oh, that's it? A great idea!
rachel_green Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
chandler_bing If I help, we can find 'em faster!
rachel_green That's right!
phoebe_buffay Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
rachel_green Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, who's it for?
rachel_green Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
phoebe_buffay Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
rachel_green We are so gonna find them this year.
chandler_bing Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green No, we never do that
chandler_bing Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
monica_geller Okay, here comes another camera.
dr_ross_geller Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
dr_ross_geller Why do they keep doing that?
monica_geller If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
dr_ross_geller Right.
dr_ross_geller Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
girl#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 We learned how to dance.
monica_geller Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
janine_lecroix Hey! You're a good dancer!
joey_tribbiani Really?
janine_lecroix Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
joey_tribbiani What do you mean?
janine_lecroix Like this.
janine_lecroix That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh.
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no we came together!
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
joey_tribbiani No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Really, y'think so? I don't..
chandler_bing I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
rachel_green Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
chandler_bing Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
rachel_green Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
chandler_bing Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
rachel_green Ha!
chandler_bing Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
rachel_green Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
dr_ross_geller We know!
monica_geller Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Okay, everybody hold!
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Next on the platforms are.....you two! And.....You two!
monica_geller Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
dr_ross_geller Monica! Would it?
joey_tribbiani Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
the_tall_guy She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown - I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
the_tall_guy No I don't think so.
joey_tribbiani Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
the_tall_guy Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
joey_tribbiani Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
the_tall_guy No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
joey_tribbiani Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
the_tall_guy God! What are you, in second grade?
joey_tribbiani Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
monica_geller Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller The routine!
monica_geller Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
dr_ross_geller Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
monica_geller Was it really that good?
dr_ross_geller We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
monica_geller Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
monica_geller 5 6 7 8!
dr_ross_geller So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
monica_geller Yes!
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
the_tall_guy Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 What's going on over here?
joey_tribbiani Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
dr_ross_geller Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
monica_geller I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
dr_ross_geller No!
monica_geller Me too!
dr_ross_geller Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
monica_geller Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
joeys_head#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.

joey_tribbiani No! Year! Happy No Year!
director#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode10 Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Look who I found!
chandler_bing Oh, hey guys!
phoebe_buffay Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
chandler_bing Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
phoebe_buffay Or we could just follow your clever jokes - any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
chandler_bing Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
phoebe_buffay Hmm, how about my azzz?
rachel_green Hey, this is hollow.
phoebe_buffay What?
rachel_green This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
phoebe_buffay No, don't look directly at them!
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay Alright, no, we could look at them!
rachel_green Oh, this one's for me!
phoebe_buffay Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
chandler_bing Oh great!
phoebe_buffay And the big one's for me!
rachel_green Ooh, let's open them!
chandler_bing Okay! Okay! Okay!
phoebe_buffay Hee hee!
chandler_bing Wait, we can't do this.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Why?
chandler_bing I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
rachel_green Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
chandler_bing Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
phoebe_buffay Will you get us better gifts?
chandler_bing Fine!
monica_geller Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
chandler_bing That's what you got me?
phoebe_buffay Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
joey_tribbiani Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
janine_lecroix Joey.
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
janine_lecroix 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yoii. What was that for?
janine_lecroix Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
joey_tribbiani Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
janine_lecroix In the moment, yeah.
joey_tribbiani But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
janine_lecroix Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
joey_tribbiani No.
janine_lecroix Me neither.
joey_tribbiani 3, 2,
janine_lecroix Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
joey_tribbiani Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
monica_geller We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
rachel_green Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
monica_geller Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
rachel_green 'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
monica_geller What? We could do it!
dr_ross_geller I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
monica_geller I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
monica_geller I can't do it!
chandler_bing Now you do that, you're on TV.
