chandler_bing Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
joey_tribbiani I know. Ross is getting married.
chandler_bing Phoebe is, making people.
joey_tribbiani Everybody's doing stuff!
chandler_bing And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
joey_tribbiani We could climb Mt. Everest!
chandler_bing No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
chandler_bing Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay What-what's up?
joey_tribbiani We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
chandler_bing Yeah baby!
phoebe_buffay Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
chandler_bing Yeah, well
joey_tribbiani We could get that Everest video though.
chandler_bing Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
joey_tribbiani And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
chandler_bing Oh, well
phoebe_buffay So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
chandler_bing Yeeeeahhhh.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Yeah.
chandler_bing But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
joey_tribbiani Yeah we are!
emily_waltham So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
dr_ross_geller Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
emily_waltham Yeah, they're fine.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
emily_waltham If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
dr_ross_geller Sure. Why not?
emily_waltham Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
emily_waltham I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
dr_ross_geller Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
emily_waltham Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
dr_ross_geller Yeah sure.
emily_waltham Earl Grey?
dr_ross_geller Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
dr_ross_geller I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
chandler_bing And I just want a million dollars!
monica_geller Rachel?!
rachel_green Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
monica_geller Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
rachel_green Hi, sure!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
rachel_green I knew.
dr_ross_geller You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
rachel_green I did.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
rachel_green Yeah, maybe...
dr_ross_geller Okay... okay, maybe I will...
dr_ross_geller See, I see.... big passion in your future.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller I do.
rachel_green Oh Ross, you're so great.
joey_tribbiani It's never gonna happen.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
rachel_green Ohhh!!!!
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes, that's right...
rachel_green Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
dr_ross_geller What? Ow!

rachel_green Yes! Did you see that?
dr_ross_geller You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
rachel_green I could not have done this without you.
dr_ross_geller Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
dr_ross_geller You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
rachel_green Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
dr_ross_geller The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
rachel_green Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
dr_ross_geller Fine.
rachel_green 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
dr_ross_geller Good.
rachel_green Good.
rachel_green Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
dr_ross_geller No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
rachel_green Well neither do I!
dr_ross_geller Is this about Mark?
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller Okay, it's not, it's not.
rachel_green Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
dr_ross_geller Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
rachel_green I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..

rachel_green Okay! All right! How was she?
chandler_bing Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Was she good?
joey_tribbiani Don't answer that.
rachel_green Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
dr_ross_geller She was...
joey_tribbiani Awful! Horrible!
chandler_bing She was not good. Not good.
joey_tribbiani She was nothing compared to you.
dr_ross_geller She, she was different.
joey_tribbiani Ewwwww!
chandler_bing Uh-oh.
rachel_green Good different?
dr_ross_geller Nobody likes change.
dr_ross_geller What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
rachel_green ..the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
dr_ross_geller WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
rachel_green You seem to really like her.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
rachel_green Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
dr_ross_geller You think?
rachel_green Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you're right.
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
joey_tribbiani Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
phoebe_buffay Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
chandler_bing Hello!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
chandler_bing Noo.
joey_tribbiani Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
phoebe_buffay I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
chandler_bing I didn't know that.
monica_geller I never knew that either.
joey_tribbiani I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
rachel_green Hey guys! What's up?
joey_tribbiani Heyyy.
monica_geller We're hanging out.
rachel_green What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
chandler_bing See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
rachel_green Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
monica_geller I'm sorry honey.
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
rachel_green Oh, honey, I don't know. I
chandler_bing This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket
monica_geller You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
rachel_green No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
rachel_green Who's this from?
chandler_bing Oh, that's Ross's.
rachel_green Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
phoebe_buffay Remembered what?
rachel_green It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
monica_geller I can't believe he did this.
chandler_bing Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
rachel_green What did you just say?
chandler_bing F-hah.... flennin....
rachel_green Oh.... my God.
rachel_green Oh my God.
julie#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode21 Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
dr_ross_geller But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
rachel_green Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

dr_ross_geller When, when were you... under me?
rachel_green Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
dr_ross_geller OK, I need to lie down.
joey_tribbiani He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller Really. It's always been you, Rach.

rachel_green Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
dr_ross_geller What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
dr_ross_geller Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
gunther I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
dr_ross_geller Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
rachel_green Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
dr_ross_geller You still love me?
rachel_green Noo.

rachel_green Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.

chandler_bing Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
monica_geller Oh, dad, turn it off.

joey_tribbiani Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
rachel_green I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
monica_geller If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
mrs_geller#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode21 I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
all@ No, no, no.
dr_ross_geller OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.

mrs_geller#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode21 Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
monica_geller I can't believe you did that.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well.
phoebe_buffay See, he's her lobster.
monica_geller Nooooo. You're really not going?
rachel_green Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
monica_geller You don't have a car. And your license expired.
rachel_green I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
chandler_bing All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
joey_tribbiani It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
chandler_bing Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
joey_tribbiani I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
chandler_bing If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
