joey Wow! This girl is good.
phoebe Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
chandler I like her.

joey Ah, anything we might of heard of?
leslie Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
monica_ross_and_joey Home is Home Star stew.
leslie Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
phoebe Hmm, bummer.
leslie Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
phoebe No. But thanks.
leslie Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
phoebe Okay. No. But thanks.
leslie Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
joey Wow, that was kinda brutal.
phoebe Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
monica Yeah, sure.
gunther Someone in there?
chandler No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
chandler Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
woman Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.

ross Hi.
rachel Hi, sweetie!
ross Hello.
mark Hi, Ross.
ross Yeah, huh.
rachel I've got some bad news.
ross What?
rachel I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
ross Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
mark Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
ross But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
rachel Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
ross Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
mark Okay, then.
ross Okay.
rachel Well we're gonna miss you around here.
mark Yeah, me too.
mark So, see ya on Saturday.
rachel Yeah, you bet.
phoebe Oh.
monica Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
phoebe Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
monica Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
phoebe Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
monica Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
phoebe You never run on a barge!
joey Hey.
phoebe_and_monica Hey.
joey Is ah, is Chandler around?
monica No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
joey Oooh.
monica Yeah, Ginger something.
joey Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
monica No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
joey Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
monica Well, what did you do?
joey What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
monica Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
joey All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
monica You gave her food poisoning!?
joey I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
phoebe Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
joey I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
monica Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
joey I ran!!
chandler Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
ginger Actually, me too.
chandler Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
ginger Oh damn, I hate that.
chandler Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
ginger Oh, don't worry about it.
chandler No, really you're gonna freeze.
ginger No, I'm not.
chandler You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
ginger Some day, maybe.
rachel Funny book?
ross Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
rachel Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
ross Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
rachel Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
ross Oh, well...
rachel Oh my God!!! Ross!!
ross Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
rachel Because, he's my friend.
ross Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
rachel Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
ross Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
rachel I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
ross Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
rachel Really!?
ross Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
rachel Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
ross What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
monica Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
phoebe It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
monica Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
phoebe You think you know me so well.
monica Well, don't 'cha wanna?
phoebe Yeah.
monica Okay, well I do know you.
phoebe That's what I said.
monica Well so?
phoebe I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
leslie My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
phoebe I stepped in something icky.
phoebe_and_leslie Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
lecturer We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
ross I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
rachel Oh.
phoebe Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
leslie Wow, that's great.
phoebe Oh, yeah!
leslie Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
phoebe I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
leslie What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
phoebe Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
leslie Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
phoebe That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
lecturer ...oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
monica Hi!
chandler Hey.
monica Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
chandler Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
monica So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
chandler Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
monica Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
chandler Joey told you about the leg, huh?
monica Uh-huh.
chandler Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
joey Morning.
chandler Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
joey Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
chandler It came up.
joey Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
ross So I nodded off a little.
rachel Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
ross Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
rachel Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
ross First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
rachel Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
ross Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
rachel Oh, that is so...
ross No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
rachel Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
ross No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
rachel It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
ross That's a little clearer.
rachel Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
ross Sure, I-I-I...
ginger Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
chandler No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
ginger It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: 'How much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
chandler No. No. I don't think so.
ginger Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
ginger What's that?
chandler That's-that's my nubbin.
ginger What's a nubbin?
chandler It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
ginger You have three nipples?
chandler Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
ginger Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
chandler You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
ginger Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
phoebe Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
leslie Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
phoebe Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
leslie I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
phoebe No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
leslie No, no, I don't want to forget it.
phoebe Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
commercial Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
monica Sorry, Pheebs.
joey Yeah. You okay?
phoebe Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
joey Yeah.
monica We'd love too.
phoebe Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
chandler Well hello!
joey Where have you been?
chandler The doctor.
ross Is everything okay?
chandler Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
monica Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
rachel What?!!
monica Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
chandler That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
