chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller What's the matter?
chandler_bing Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
phoebe_buffay Oh Willie's still alive!
chandler_bing What are you guys doing?
monica_geller Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
chandler_bing Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
monica_geller That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
chandler_bing No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
chandler_bing I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
monica_geller Oh, here's a great one.
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm not in that.
monica_geller I know, but look at me all tan.
phoebe_buffay Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
monica_geller That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know
phoebe_buffay Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
monica_geller Chandler what do you say?
chandler_bing All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
dr_ross_geller Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh
chandler_bing How about those three pointers?
dr_ross_geller Amazing!
chandler_bing And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
rachel_green Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
chandler_bing Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
rachel_green Hey, I thought that guy was married.
phoebe_buffay He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
dr_ross_geller It's not a club.
rachel_green Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
dr_ross_geller Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
chandler_bing They have that on the napkins at the club.
rachel_green Oh, I gotta get back to work.
phoebe_buffay You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
rachel_green Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
chandler_bing Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
rachel_green Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
dr_ross_geller Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
rachel_green I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
phoebe_buffay So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
rachel_green Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
dr_ross_geller Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
chandler_bing Dude that is so sad.
dr_ross_geller I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
chandler_bing Could I play?
rachel_green Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
tag_jones I just did them.
rachel_green Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
tag_jones What?
rachel_green Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?

rachel_green No. Why?
melissa Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
rachel_green Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
melissa Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
rachel_green Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
melissa Oh no!
rachel_green Oh yeah. All right, back to work.

rachel_green Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
the_photographer Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
chandler_bing Okay.
the_photographer I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
chandler_bing No, I am.
monica_geller Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
chandler_bing I do?
monica_geller Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
chandler_bing Okay.

rachel_green Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
rachel_green Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
joey_tribbiani Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
rachel_green Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
joey_tribbiani All right, I guess this will be fine.
rachel_green Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
joey_tribbiani Nothing, why?
rachel_green How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
joey_tribbiani Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
rachel_green I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
joey_tribbiani Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
rachel_green Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, okay.
rachel_green Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
rachel_green Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
monica_geller I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
chandler_bing Aww!
monica_geller That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
dr_ross_geller I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
monica_geller They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
chandler_bing Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
monica_geller Do you really want to pull at that thread?
phoebe_buffay I'm having a really good time!
hums_while_he_pees#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode05 Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
phoebe_buffay Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.

phoebe_buffay Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
hums_while_he_pees#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode05 I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
phoebe_buffay Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

phoebe_buffay Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?

phoebe_buffay Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
dr_ross_geller What?! No!
phoebe_buffay Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
dr_ross_geller Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.

phoebe_buffay I don't have it!
dr_ross_geller It's right there!
phoebe_buffay Ugh, okay Sherlock!

dr_ross_geller Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
whitney Sure.
dr_ross_geller Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
phoebe_buffay Watching ballroom dancing?
dr_ross_geller Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
phoebe_buffay Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
dr_ross_geller Like what?
phoebe_buffay Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
dr_ross_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay And! She uses sex as a weapon!
dr_ross_geller Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
phoebe_buffay You're still gonna go out with her?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me
phoebe_buffay No listen to me! She is crazy!
whitney Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
phoebe_buffay You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
tag_jones Good morning.
rachel_green Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
tag_jones Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
rachel_green Ohh that's nice.
tag_jones Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
rachel_green Wo-women? You mean like old women?
tag_jones Well kinda old, like 30.
rachel_green Oh.
tag_jones And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
rachel_green That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
tag_jones A little.
rachel_green Yeah?
tag_jones How you doin'?
joey_tribbiani See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
chandler_bing I can't help it!
joey_tribbiani All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
chandler_bing Borrow money from me?
joey_tribbiani Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down
chandler_bing Why is there jelly on your shoe?
joey_tribbiani I had a donut.

joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
rachel_green So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! That guy's all right!
rachel_green Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
joey_tribbiani What?
rachel_green Y'know, all the women.
joey_tribbiani Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
chandler_bing I'm right here!
rachel_green All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
joey_tribbiani Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
chandler_bing I'm still right here!
rachel_green All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
joey_tribbiani What?!
rachel_green I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
joey_tribbiani I know, Monica told me.
chandler_bing Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
rachel_green Yeah. Sure.
chandler_bing Can you people not see me?!
rachel_green So, will you talk to him?
joey_tribbiani I don't know Rach.
rachel_green Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
joey_tribbiani One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
tag_jones Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
tag_jones Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
joey_tribbiani Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
tag_jones Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, for you!
monica_geller Hey! There you are!
chandler_bing There I am!
monica_geller Are you okay?
chandler_bing Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
monica_geller Chandler, what were you thinking?
chandler_bing I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down
monica_geller Chandler?
chandler_bing Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
phoebe_buffay So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
dr_ross_geller Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
phoebe_buffay Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
dr_ross_geller Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
phoebe_buffay You think he's emotionally unavailable?
dr_ross_geller I think he can be.
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
dr_ross_geller Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
phoebe_buffay Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
dr_ross_geller I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
phoebe_buffay We want the last six years back!!
dr_ross_geller So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
tag_jones Good morning Rachel.
rachel_green Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
tag_jones Went out with Joey.
rachel_green Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
tag_jones No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
rachel_green Wow! I did not see that coming.
tag_jones It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
rachel_green Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
tag_jones When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
rachel_green Really?
tag_jones Someone I can spoil, y'know?
rachel_green Sp-spoil?
tag_jones Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
tag_jones Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
rachel_green Well, I-I'm startin' too.
tag_jones And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
rachel_green Yes! Hell yes!
tag_jones All right then, it's settled.
rachel_green Okay.
tag_jones I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
rachel_green I'd love to!
tag_jones What?
rachel_green Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
dr_ross_geller My God!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
dr_ross_geller Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
phoebe_buffay Oh he knows! For the most part.
kyle Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
whitney We kinda need to talk.
phoebe_buffay Both of you together?
dr_ross_geller Wh-what's up?
whitney Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing
kyle ...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
dr_ross_geller Oh just say it Kyle!
kyle We're gonna give it another try.
phoebe_buffay What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
whitney I'm gonna work on that.
phoebe_buffay Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, he hums when he pees!
whitney I do know.
dr_ross_geller It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
whitney We're so sorry.
dr_ross_geller That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
kyle Yeah, we're gonna go.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, were better off without them.
phoebe_buffay And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
dr_ross_geller Divorced men's club.
