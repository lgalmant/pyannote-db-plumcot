monica Hey! So what do you think?
chandler New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
monica Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
chandler Oh my God!
monica I know.
chandler I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
monica I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
chandler She had a point.
rachel Hi!
monica Hey.
rachel Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
monica They're mine!
chandler Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
rachel Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
monica Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
chandler I have you.
monica Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
ross That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
phoebe How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
rachel He's talking to the baby.
phoebe Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
rachel Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
phoebe Okay.
ross Bye.
rachel Bye.
joey Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!
rachel Hi.
joey Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren
rachel No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
joey No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
rachel I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
joey Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
rachel Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
joey Okay, so will you meet with her?
rachel Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
joey Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
rachel Yeah.
joey She took 'em!
phoebe Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
ross Yeah. Why?
phoebe Sting has a son that goes there too!
ross Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
phoebe You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
ross Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
phoebe Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
ross What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
phoebe No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
ross Uh, I actually haven't even met him.
phoebe Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
ross Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
phoebe There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
monica Hey guys!
chandler Hey-hey.
rachel Hi Monica!
monica Hey.
rachel Hi boots.
monica See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants
chandler You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
phoebe Wow! They're beautiful!
rachel Ahh
monica They hurt so much!
phoebe What?!
monica The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
rachel Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
monica I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
phoebe Well then get your money back and return them!
monica I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
ross Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
chandler I don't think you did a very thorough job!
ross I dropped him off at Carol's. Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
phoebe Oh no! Why not?
ross Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
phoebe How come?!
ross Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
phoebe Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
ross Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.
phoebe Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
ross Playpen?! Ben's seven!
phoebe Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
ross Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
phoebe Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
ross What?
phoebe Rosssss can!
ross Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just
phoebe Rossss can!
ross Phoebe, I
phoebe Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
joey Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
rachel Oh Joey, I'm hardly a
joey My little sister Dina!
rachel Right! Hi Dina!
dina Hi.
rachel Nice to meet you.
dina Thanks so much for meetin' with me. Joey's told me so much about you!
joey This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business.
rachel Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel
dina I...I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
rachel And there's marketing
monica Ahhhhhhhh!
chandler What's wrong?
monica Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
chandler Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
monica Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
chandler Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining.
monica I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
chandler Why not?
monica Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
chandler Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
monica Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.
chandler You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
monica Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
chandler Okay.
monica Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
dina I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!
rachel Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for.
dina Thank you.
rachel Okay.
joey Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
rachel Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
joey Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
dina Joe, mom and dad are fine
joey Is that a sandwich?!
rachel Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
dina I'm pregnant.
joey What?!
rachel Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
joey Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
dina Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
rachel What?! Dina
joey Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
dina Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.
joey You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
dina Why? Where are you going?
joey I can't look at you right now!
dina Wow.
rachel I know.
phoebe Oh, there you are Ben!
ben Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
phoebe Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
ben Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
phoebe Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
ben I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
phoebe Him you're friends with.
the_teacher Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
phoebe Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
the_teacher Are you with one of the students?
phoebe Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
the_teacher Are you one of Ben's mothers?
phoebe I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
the_teacher Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
phoebe Oh.
the_teacher I've only met your partner Carol.
phoebe Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
the_teacher Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben? Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
phoebe Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
the_teacher Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
phoebe Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
chandler Y'know, that party wasn't bad.
monica Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
chandler I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
monica Oh no, we can't walk!
chandler What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
monica Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
chandler What's going on?
monica I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
chandler What?
monica Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
chandler So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
monica How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
chandler Hop on.
monica Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh
chandler Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
dina Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
rachel What college was that Dina?
dina Oh my God! Bobby!
bobby Hi Dina. Good to see you.
rachel Joey, what are you doing?
joey Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman
rachel Oh Joey this is crazy!
joey Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man
dina No!
joey Oh you'll take 'em!
dina No I won't!
joey Hey! You don't get a say in this!
dina Yes I do!
joey Ahhh! I heard "I do", we're halfway there! Okay! You!
rachel All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
bobby Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
joey Well what am I supposed to do?
rachel You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
joey No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
rachel Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
bobby Yeah...we kinda didn't use any
rachel Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
phoebe Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
trudie_styler Hi!
phoebe Hi!
trudie_styler I'm Trudie.
phoebe Uh-huh.
trudie_styler You must be Ben's mum.
phoebe Why else would I be here?
trudie_styler Do sit down.
phoebe Uh-huh.
trudie_styler I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
phoebe Yeah.
trudie_styler I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.
phoebe Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
trudie_styler Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
phoebe Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
trudie_styler Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
phoebe Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
trudie_styler So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
phoebe Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
trudie_styler Are you here for tickets?
phoebe Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
trudie_styler I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
phoebe Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
trudie_styler Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
phoebe The Police? Here? A reunion?!
chandler Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
monica Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
chandler Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
monica My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
chandler I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
monica Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
chandler I don't have your boots.
monica Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
chandler Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
monica Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
chandler Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
monica Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
chandler Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
monica Okay. All right.
chandler Okay.
monica Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!
rachel Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
joey Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
bobby Well...I really have high hopes for my band.
joey You were right. He is funny.
rachel Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
bobby Well it's just me and my pal Rooster, the band's name is Numb Nuts.
rachel Really?
joey Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!
dina No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!
joey So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
rachel Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
joey No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
dina Excuse me?
joey One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
rachel So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
joey Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!
dina Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help. And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
bobby You bet I am! And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.
dina Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?
joey Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
dina And you're my big brother! I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world. I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
joey Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
dina Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
joey Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
dina We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
joey That's right! By his uncle too!
bobby And by you.
rachel Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
joey Come here!
rachel No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
ross You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
phoebe Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
ross Well...let's just say... Rosss caaaaan!
phoebe Oo, where are the seats?
ross Uh, middle balcony.
phoebe Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
ross Yeah.
phoebe Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
