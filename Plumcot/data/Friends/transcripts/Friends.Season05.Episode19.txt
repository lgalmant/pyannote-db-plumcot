dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
chandler_bing Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
dr_ross_geller Wow! How'd you get in there?
chandler_bing Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
delivery_girl#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode19 Hi Chandler!
chandler_bing Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
caitlin Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
chandler_bing Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
caitlin It's uh, 27 dollars even.
chandler_bing Oh, okay. Here you go.
caitlin Hey, where's the chicken?
chandler_bing Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
caitlin Great. I'll see you later!
chandler_bing Okay, bye!
dr_ross_geller What the hell was that?!
chandler_bing What?
dr_ross_geller The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
chandler_bing I was not flirting.
dr_ross_geller It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
chandler_bing Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, right.
chandler_bing You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
dr_ross_geller I'm good.
rachel_green I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
phoebe_buffay I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
rachel_green No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
phoebe_buffay Don't get me started on that.
chandler_bing I was not flirting.
dr_ross_geller And on your anniversary, for shame!
rachel_green What's going on?
dr_ross_geller Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
chandler_bing I was not and oh God, shh!
dr_ross_geller Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
phoebe_buffay Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
dr_ross_geller Well
chandler_bing Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
rachel_green Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
dr_ross_geller Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
rachel_green Hm-mmm.
dr_ross_geller And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
rachel_green Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
phoebe_buffay Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
dr_ross_geller This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
phoebe_buffay See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
joey_tribbiani Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
rachel_green Big night!
phoebe_buffay This is so cool!
chandler_bing So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
joey_tribbiani Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
joey_tribbiani She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so
monica_geller Hey! Happy Anniversary!
chandler_bing Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
monica_geller So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London
chandler_bing Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
monica_geller Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
chandler_bing The one that doesn't.
monica_geller That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
chandler_bing Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
monica_geller That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller You have got to go home!
phoebe_buffay But I like it here!
monica_geller You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
monica_geller Great!
phoebe_buffay Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
rachel_green Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
joey_tribbiani Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
phoebe_buffay I guess so.
rachel_green Here you go. Thank you!
phoebe_buffay Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
rachel_green Oh what, you-you want both of them?
phoebe_buffay Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
rachel_green Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
phoebe_buffay Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
rachel_green Tell her to wear her own earrings.
phoebe_buffay These are her earrings.
rachel_green Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
phoebe_buffay Why not?
rachel_green Because I lose her stuff!
joey_tribbiani Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
joey_tribbiani Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
chandler_bing If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
monica_geller Rach? What are you doing?
rachel_green Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
monica_geller It's a diaper commercial.
rachel_green Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
caitlin Pizza delivery!
dr_ross_geller I'll get it! I will get that!
caitlin Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
caitlin One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
caitlin What?!
dr_ross_geller The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
caitlin Oh. Thanks.
dr_ross_geller You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
caitlin Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
chandler_bing Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
caitlin I'm gonna try.
chandler_bing You're welcome.
dr_ross_geller You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
chandler_bing What?
dr_ross_geller This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
monica_geller What's goin' on?
dr_ross_geller Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
chandler_bing Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
monica_geller It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
dr_ross_geller Really?!
chandler_bing Really?!
monica_geller It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
chandler_bing So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
monica_geller Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
chandler_bing Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
joey_tribbiani True story!
monica_geller Chandler, this actually bothers you?
chandler_bing Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
rachel_green Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
dr_ross_geller And thank you, for that.
rachel_green But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
dr_ross_geller What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
rachel_green Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
dr_ross_geller All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
phoebe_buffay I found it!
rachel_green Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
phoebe_buffay On your dresser.
rachel_green Okay that is the one we already have!
joey_tribbiani Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
monica_geller What?
joey_tribbiani Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
chandler_bing Well, what is it?
joey_tribbiani Oh, they cut me out of the show.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Are you sure?
phoebe_buffay Maybe your scene's coming up?
joey_tribbiani Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani I'm in it.
phoebe_buffay This is terrible, what are you going to do?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
phoebe_buffay That's not good.
joey_tribbiani No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
rachel_green Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
chandler_bing If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
joey_tribbiani Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
grandma_tribbiani No! Sam Waterston!
joey_tribbiani No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
grandma_tribbiani No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
chandler_bing Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
monica_geller Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
phoebe_buffay But I already gave them back to you!
monica_geller No you didn't.
phoebe_buffay All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
rachel_green It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
phoebe_buffay Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
rachel_green Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
phoebe_buffay Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
phoebe_buffay Why are you being weird?
dr_ross_geller Do you like it?
phoebe_buffay No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
phoebe_buffay Ohh! I did not get that.
chandler_bing So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
monica_geller Yeah, it's good.
chandler_bing See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
monica_geller Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
chandler_bing Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
monica_geller Go on, teach me something about men and women.
chandler_bing Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
monica_geller No way!
chandler_bing It's true.
monica_geller Well that's pathetic!
chandler_bing Again true.
monica_geller And this goes for all guys?
chandler_bing All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
joey_tribbiani All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
dr_ross_geller Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
joey_tribbiani I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
monica_geller No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, all right. Ooh!
grandma_tribbiani Joey!
chandler_bing Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Did you find it?
rachel_green The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
phoebe_buffay Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
rachel_green Okay, calm down, here they are.
monica_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay What are we going to do?!
rachel_green I don't know, I don't know.
phoebe_buffay All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
rachel_green Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
phoebe_buffay I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
rachel_green Ohh that'd be great!
phoebe_buffay Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
monica_geller Yeah, what is it?
phoebe_buffay Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
monica_geller Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
phoebe_buffay I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
monica_geller All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
phoebe_buffay No.
monica_geller Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! You're the best!
rachel_green Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
monica_geller That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
rachel_green Your sunglasses?!
monica_geller Yes!
phoebe_buffay Oh, right!
caitlin Pizza!
dr_ross_geller Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
chandler_bing Okay, hold on. Okay.
rachel_green Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to
dr_ross_geller You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?

caitlin It's uh, $12.50.
dr_ross_geller Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
caitlin No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
dr_ross_geller Gas? Wow! Intense.
chandler_bing If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
dr_ross_geller Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
caitlin Yeah.
dr_ross_geller They put that in.
caitlin What?!
dr_ross_geller The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
caitlin Well okay!
dr_ross_geller A lot of other gas smells
chandler_bing Oh the humanity.
dr_ross_geller Meth-methane smells
caitlin Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
dr_ross_geller Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
caitlin Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
dr_ross_geller Was I talking to her about gas?
chandler_bing More so than anything else.
phoebe_buffay I-I-I found it interesting.
rachel_green I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
rachel_green Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
phoebe_buffay Ross?
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
phoebe_buffay What else do they add smell too?
rachel_green Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
caitlin Oh, is there a problem?
rachel_green No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
caitlin Oh my God! That was flirting?!
rachel_green Yeah.
caitlin Wow!
rachel_green I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
caitlin The guy with the gas?!
rachel_green Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
caitlin Really?!
rachel_green Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
caitlin I just, I thought Joey was there.
rachel_green Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.

rachel_green Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
dr_ross_geller And she just gave you this?
rachel_green Yeah!
