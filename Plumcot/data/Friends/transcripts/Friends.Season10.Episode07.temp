ross Hey you guys!
phoebe Hey!
ross Hey, what are you doing?
mike Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
chandler That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
ross Yeah!
phoebe It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
chandler Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
phoebe So what did you two do about it?
chandler It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
ross There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
mike I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
ross Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
phoebe But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
mike Are you serious?
phoebe Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
mike I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
ross I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
chandler Maybe you do that next time you get married!
ross No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey What's going on?
chandler Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
monica We?
chandler You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
joey Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
chandler Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
monica And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
joey Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
chandler Little people?
joey Celebrity.
monica Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
chandler What...? NO!
monica Chandler?
chandler I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
monica Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
chandler I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
monica It isn't mine!
joey Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
charity_guy May I help you?
phoebe Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
charity_guy Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
phoebe Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
charity_guy Well, this is very generous!
phoebe And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
mike Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
phoebe Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
charity_guy Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
mike Not necessary.
phoebe Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
mike And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
charity_guy Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
phoebe Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
mike It does. It feels really good!
phoebe Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
charity_guy Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
phoebe Mhm... it's moist.
ross Hi!
rachel Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
ross Oh, good!
rachel Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
ross Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
rachel Absolutely.
ross There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
rachel So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
ross Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
rachel Oh my God, what!?
ross Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
rachel Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
ross Be-caaauuuse...
rachel All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
ross Seriously?
rachel Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
ross And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
rachel Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
ross Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
rachel Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
ross Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
rachel All right!
ross Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
rachel Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
ross Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
monica Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
chandler Ok, ok, here we go.
monica Ok.
chandler Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
phoebe Hello, is this the creepy residence?
monica We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
phoebe Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
monica I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
phoebe No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
monica That's crazy! I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
phoebe We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
monica That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
phoebe City Hall.
monica Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
phoebe It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding
monica Yay!
chandler But you already gave all your money to charity!
phoebe Well, I'll just ask for it back!
chandler I don't think you can do that!
monica Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
chandler That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
rachel Ok, careful.
ross Ok.
rachel Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
ross Rach, she's got like three hairs!
rachel I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
ross I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
rachel Ok.
ross Ready sweety?
rachel Ok.
ross Here we go!
rachel Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
ross See, I told you!
rachel Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
ross Oh, absolutely!
rachel Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
ross Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
mike We're seriously asking for our money back?
phoebe It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
charity_guy Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
phoebe Gay, go.
mike Oh my God, I love your shirt!
phoebe The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
charity_guy Excuse me?
phoebe Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.
charity_guy So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
mike Yeah! This feels really good.
phoebe I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
charity_guy Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing...
phoebe Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to "kill me" or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.
mike She could have been talking about either one of us.
laura Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
monica Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
laura Thank you!
monica Would you like something to drink?
laura Oh, water would be fine.
monica Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
chandler Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
laura Your place is just lovely.
monica Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
laura You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
monica Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
chandler But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
laura Oh...
chandler What?
laura I just realized why I remember this place.
monica Really? What is it?
laura Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
monica Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
laura Yes!
chandler Of course it was!
laura Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
chandler RAT BASTARD!
laura So you're not friends with him?
monica_and_chandler OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
laura Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
joey Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
laura What was that?
chandler Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
rachel Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
ross SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
rachel Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
ross No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
rachel Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
ross No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
rachel I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
ross Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
rachel Alright fine. I'll do it.
ross Good.
rachel If you hold a spider.
ross WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
rachel IF you hold a spider.
ross I know.
joey Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
chandler AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
laura What's going on?
chandler Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
joey Guys!?
monica Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
joey What's going on?
chandler WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
joey Everything doesn't sound fine!
laura Is he alright out there by himself?
chandler Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
laura Bert and Ernie!
chandler You can't make this stuff up!
mike You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
phoebe Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
mike Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
phoebe Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.
mike No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
phoebe Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
mike Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
phoebe And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
laura Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.
monica Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
laura Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here...
monica Why don't I show you the baby's room?
chandler What the hell are you doing?
joey Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
chandler Well, we're not.
joey But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
chandler We don't have a code word.
joey We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
monica So that was the baby's room.
monica What room should we see next?
chandler Any room that isn't behind this couch!
monica Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny!
joey I did not care for that!
chandler You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
joey Ok, ok!
chandler Ok!
chandler What?
joey I forgot my bat.
laura Oh my God!
chandler And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
laura What are you doing here?
joey Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
laura Are you friends with him?
chandler I can explain... Joey...
joey Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
laura Excuse me?
joey Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
laura I gave you my number, you never called me.
joey No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
laura Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
joey Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
laura I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
joey No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
laura Joey, wait!
joey NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...
laura I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
chandler Oh, that's really ok.
monica Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
laura Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.
joey LAURA!
phoebe We're back!
charity_guy Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
mike No, no, we're here to give the money back.
phoebe Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
phoebe Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!
charity_guy If I haven't said so already sir, congratulations!
mike Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?
charity_guy You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
mike What?
charity_guy On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
phoebe But... but... but we're giving you this!
charity_guy Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
phoebe Well, this is very generous!
charity_guy Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
mike Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
charity_guy Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
phoebe Oh, is that you?
charity_guy No!
monica Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
chandler Wrong number?
monica It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
chandler That's great!
monica Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
chandler Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
rachel Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
ross Ok...
rachel Ok...
ross This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
rachel Ok... O-k...
rachel Ok...
rachel whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
ross See?
rachel A-alright! I can do this.
ross There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
rachel That's because he's on your neck.
ross Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
rachel ROSS!
