monica Erica, are you okay?
erica Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
monica Oh my God!
chandler Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
monica She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
chandler Oh my God!
rachel So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
ross Rach!
rachel What?!
ross Hey.
rachel Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
ross Oh. This was amazing.
rachel It really was. You've learned some new moves!
ross Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
rachel Ah.
ross Who's laughing now?
rachel I know!
monica Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
chandler Next time, can I say breathe?
monica No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
erica No, I'm okay.
monica Alright, I'll be right back.
chandler Where are you going?
monica To use the bathroom.
chandler You can't leave me alone with her.
monica What?
chandler This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
monica What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
chandler It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
monica You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
chandler Okay.
chandler So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
erica I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
chandler Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
erica What?
chandler Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
chandler One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
phoebe Morning.
joey Hey!
phoebe What's that?
joey It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
phoebe It's a baby chick and duck!
joey Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
phoebe I did not see that coming.
joey Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
phoebe Yes.
joey Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
phoebe That is the rule, though.
phoebe Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
ross What?
joey Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
ross Oh my God!
phoebe Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
ross Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
phoebe Have you seen him throw a ball?
ross Is Rachel here?
joey Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
ross Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
phoebe What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
ross Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
joey Oh my God. You and Rachel?
ross I know, it's pretty great.
joey So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
ross Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
phoebe But do you wanna get back together?
ross I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
phoebe YAY!
ross Shhh!
phoebe Yay!
joey So, so is she still going to Paris?
ross Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
phoebe Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
rachel Morning!
phoebe Guess we'll never know how it ends.
joey Okay.
ross Hey.
rachel Hey.
ross Hey. How did you sleep?
rachel Good. You?
ross Good.
joey I bet you did!
ross Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
joey Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
rachel Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
phoebe Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
ross So...
ross Morning.
rachel You too. Last night was just wonderful.
ross It really was.
rachel I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
ross I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
rachel Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
monica It's just a little bit more, honey.
erica Help me! This hurts!
chandler Is it really that bad?
erica Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
doctor The baby's head is crowning.
monica Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
chandler I'm okay.
monica Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
chandler Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
doctor Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
monica It's a... It's a boy!
chandler Wow!
erica Is he okay?
doctor He's just fine.
monica Oh, you did it!
chandler It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
doctor Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
chandler Well, that's spongy.
monica Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
chandler I know. He has your eyes.
chandler I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
nurse We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
chandler Okay.
monica Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
erica I'm really happy for you guys.
chandler How do you feel?
erica I'm tired!
doctor Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
monica I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
doctor The next baby should be along in a minute.
monica We only ordered one!
doctor You know it's twins, right?
chandler Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
doctor I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
chandler Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
monica Wait, did you know it was twins?
doctor Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
monica Anybody tell you?
erica I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
monica This is unbelievable.
erica Twins actually run in my family.
chandler Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
chandler What do we do?
monica What do you mean "what do we do"?
chandler Twins! Twins!!
monica Chandler, you're panicking!
chandler Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
monica We can't split them up!
chandler Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
monica Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
chandler What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
monica Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
chandler Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
monica That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
chandler Okay. Shhh...
chandler Okay.
monica Okay!
chandler Okay!
doctor It looks like we're about ready over here.
doctor Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
erica Ow!
doctor Here she comes!
chandler She? It's a girl?
doctor Yeah.
chandler Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
ross And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
joey Oh my God! What did you say?
ross Nothing! What do you say to that?
phoebe Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
ross No way!
joey You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
ross What?
joey Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
phoebe Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
ross You really think so?
phoebe I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
rachel Hi!
phoebe Can't a girl finish a song around here?
joey Hey!
rachel Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
ross Okay.
joey Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
rachel No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
phoebe Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
rachel Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
ross Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
joey Ross, wait!
ross What? What?
joey Could you get me a muffin?
gunther Rachel?
rachel Yeah?
gunther I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
gunther I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
rachel Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a caf√©, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
rachel Oh... Bye guys.
ross Oh my God!
phoebe Unbelievable!
joey Hey, you know what might help?
ross I'm not getting you a muffin!
monica Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
chandler Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
nurse We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
monica There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
erica Oh my God, that's just like my name!
monica Son of a gun, it is!
erica Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
monica Okay, well, bye!
erica Bye!
chandler Bye!
monica We'll call you!
erica Okay.
chandler Have fun at church-camp!
monica Oh, look at these little bunnies!
chandler I know! You ready to trade?
monica Okay.
chandler Okay.
monica Alright, let's see..
chandler We could trade later.
monica Yeah, I'm good.
phoebe Hey, what are you working on?
joey It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
phoebe How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
joey No, I sat in the paint.
ross Hey.
phoebe Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
ross No, and I'm not going to.
phoebe What?
joey Why not?
ross Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
phoebe How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
ross Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
joey Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
phoebe Uh, Joe?
joey Damn it!
ross Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
phoebe No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
mike Hey!
phoebe Hey! What do you have there?
mike Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
ross Oh my God! You did that yourself?
phoebe Honey, that's gorgeous!
joey You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
rachel Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
joey Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
phoebe Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
rachel Oh my God!
ross Oh my God!
rachel Hi! Oh my gosh!
chandler Hey.
phoebe_ross_rachel Hey.
joey Hey, so what is the big surprise?
rachel Oh.
ross Oh my God!
rachel What... What...
ross Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
monica Yes, it's twins!
ross Oh my God.
joey Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
monica This is a boy, and that's a girl.
chandler Her name is Erica.
rachel Aw..
joey Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
chandler Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
monica Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
ross Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
phoebe Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
rachel Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
mike I want one.
phoebe Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
mike Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
phoebe One? How about a whole bunch?
mike Really?
phoebe Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
rachel Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
monica I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
rachel Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
monica I love you.
chandler I love you.
monica Call us when you get there.
rachel I will. Ross, come here.
rachel I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
ross Neither will I.
rachel Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
phoebe So, you just let her go?
ross Yeah.
joey Hey, maybe that's for the best.
ross Yeah?
joey Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
phoebe But now she'll never know how he feels!
joey Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
joey Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
ross Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
joey What?
ross I don't! I wanna be with her.
joey Really?
ross Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
joey Yeah, you are!
phoebe Woo!
phoebe Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
ross My coat...
joey This is so cool!
chandler I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
joey But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
ross I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
phoebe You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
ross Okay, guys, wish me luck.
phoebe Hurry!
joey Good luck, good luck!
ross There's no seatbelt!
phoebe That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
ross Alright, alright, let's do this!
phoebe Okay!
ross Hey!
man 18th and East End.
phoebe I - I don't take passengers.
man Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
ross No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
man Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
phoebe My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
man What?
ross Get out of the cab!
phoebe Get out of the cab!
joey Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
monica Now, that you can do.
joey Alright!
joey Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
phoebe You can open your eyes now.
ross Are we off the bridge?
phoebe Yes.
ross Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
phoebe Yes, she jumped right back up.
ross Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
phoebe Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
ross Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
phoebe You should have thought of that before you got in!
phoebe Toll-booth.
ross What?
phoebe Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
phoebe Hurry!
ross Okay!
phoebe Okay.
phoebe Damn, that window is clean.
joey Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
chandler We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
joey Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
chandler Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
monica Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
joey Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
chandler Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
monica Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
chandler Alright.
monica Oh God! What did I just step on?
joey Oh!
chandler It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
monica Oh..
joey You stepped on my egg roll?
monica I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
joey Just put it on a plate and leave.
chandler Okay, let's find these birds.
joey Alright.
joey Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
joey Oh! They're in the table!
chandler Well, that can't be good!
joey We gotta get them out of there!
chandler How?
joey Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
chandler Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
joey Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
chandler Joey, wait! The ball!
joey Oh!
joey Oh God! So what do we do?
chandler I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
joey Okay.
chandler No... It's all glued together.
joey Does that mean we have to bust it open?
chandler I don't know. Maybe.
joey Oh my God!
chandler I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
joey All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
chandler Did that movie ever get made?
joey It did not.
phoebe Ross, where are you going?
ross To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
phoebe What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
ross Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
phoebe You have to get a ticket to get past security.
ross What? We're never gonna make it!
phoebe Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
ross Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
gate_attendant_1 Madame, your passport please?
rachel Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
gate_attendant_1 Your boarding pass, please.
rachel Oh.
rachel Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
gate_attendant_1 Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
rachel I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
gate_attendant_1 Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
rachel Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
ross Hey, I need a ticket.
phoebe Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
ross Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
phoebe We're on our honeymoon.
ticket_agent And the destination?
ross I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
phoebe I'm so lucky I married you.
rachel Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
rachel Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
ross Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
phoebe No, did we miss it?
ross No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
phoebe Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
monica Hello.
phoebe Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
ross What? Hey, hey, listen..
monica Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
ross Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
monica Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
ross That's alright. Listen, listen.
monica Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
ross Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
monica Isn't that cute?
ross That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
monica Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
ross Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
monica That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
ross What?
monica Newark airport. Why, where are you?
ross JFK.
joey Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
chandler And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
joey Okay. Here goes.
chandler What's the matter?
joey I need to say goodbye to the table first.
chandler I understand.
joey Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
chandler I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
joey Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
chandler Well, I can't do it either.
monica Hey! Did you find them?
joey Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
chandler We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
monica Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
ross Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
phoebe Well, I've never gone this fast before.
ross Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
phoebe She's got her cell, you could call her.
ross I am not doing this over the phone.
phoebe You don't have any other choice!
rachel Hello?
phoebe Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
rachel Yeah.
phoebe For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
ross Yay.
phoebe Uh, Rach, hang on.
rachel Phoebe? Is everything okay?
phoebe Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
rachel What? Why?
phoebe I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
rachel Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
rachel Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
passenger_1 Uhm, what was that?
rachel Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
passenger_1 Okay, that doesn't sound good.
rachel I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
passenger_1 But she is sometimes.
rachel Well...
rachel Wait, what are you doing?
passenger_1 Well, I can't take this plane now.
air_stewardess Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
passenger_1 I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
rachel Could I get some peanuts?
passenger_2 What's wrong with the plane?
air_stewardess There's nothing wrong with the plane.
passenger_1 Yeah! The left Philange!
air_stewardess There is no Philange!
passenger_1 Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
passenger_2 I'm not flying on it!
air_stewardess Ma'am, please sit down!
passenger_3 What's going on?
passenger_1 We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
rachel This is ridiculous! I...
rachel Yeah, okay.
monica Alright. My job here is done.
chandler That was... Impressive.
joey Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
monica Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
chandler Sorry about the table, man.
joey Yeah.
chandler You gonna buy a new one?
joey Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
chandler Well, at least we got these little guys out.
joey Yeah.
chandler Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
joey I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
chandler Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
joey What?
chandler Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
joey I could get a goose!
chandler You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
joey Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
chandler I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
joey Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
gate_attendant_2 Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
passenger_2 And you fixed the Philange?
gate_attendant_2 Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
ross Where is she?
phoebe I don't see her.
ross Rachel! Rachel Green!
phoebe There she is!
ross Rachel! Rachel!
gate_attendant_2 Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
ross No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
gate_attendant_2 I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.

rachel Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.

ross Try to understand!
rachel Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
ross No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
rachel I got off the plane.
ross You got off the plane.
rachel I do love you.
ross I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
rachel Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
ross Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
rachel Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
ross This is it. Unless we're on a break.
ross Don't make jokes now.
monica Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
monica If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
ross Wow.
rachel I know. It seems smaller somehow.
joey Has it always been purple?
chandler Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
phoebe Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
monica Oh, yeah, that's true.
ross Uh, I haven't.
monica Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
ross Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
monica Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
chandler Oh, okay.
phoebe So, I guess this is it.
joey Yeah. I guess so.
monica This is harder than I thought it would be.
chandler Oh, it's gonna be okay.
rachel Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
monica We got some time.
rachel Okay, should we get some coffee?
chandler Sure. Where?
