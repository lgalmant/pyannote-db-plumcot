joey Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
ross Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
joey Mmh-mmh.
ross Can you say Barbados?
joey Barbados!
ross Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
rachel Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
chandler Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
phoebe I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
ross Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
phoebe No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
ross Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
joey All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
ross It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
charlie Wow! This place is beautiful!
ross Look at all these paleontologists!!
joey I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
woman Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
joey I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
woman Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
joey That... never happens...
woman I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
ross Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
woman I would love your autograph.
ross Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..."
woman Sarah.
ross "... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
sarah Thank you so much!
ross Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
sarah Are you a paleontologist?
joey No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
ross Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
joey Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
sarah I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
joey You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
monica David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
david Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
monica See?
chandler Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
monica Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
phoebe Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
phoebe Mike?? Who's Mike?
david Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
phoebe That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
david It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
phoebe Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
chandler She does?
monica Let's get you out of here!!
monica At least you took me down with you!
phoebe I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
monica I guess, in time.
phoebe Yeah.
monica I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
phoebe You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
david Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
chandler I wouldn't read too much into it.
david Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
chandler David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
david Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
chandler Seriously, we're gonna do this?
david I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
chandler Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
david That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
chandler What?
david Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
chandler I didn't mean now...
david Why not? It's brilliant! Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
chandler Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
david How do you think I should propose?
chandler David, I'm pretending to read here!!
joey Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
joey Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
charlie I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
joey You really should have been more clear about that!
ross Hey!
joey Hey!
ross You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
joey Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
ross Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
charlie Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
ross Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
joey You could say
ross Ready to go?
charlie Yeah!
joey Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
charlie Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
ross Yeah.
charlie But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
joey Will you wear a thong?
charlie I will if you will.
joey Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
ross I'm good, I have dinner plans .
charlie So you'll be ok?
joey Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
ross Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
joey No, why?
joey Oh man!
charlie There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
joey I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
monica Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
chandler I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
monica Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
chandler David is going to propose to Phoebe.
monica What? Why?
chandler Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
monica Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
chandler I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
monica They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
chandler Man, that's some bad advice!
joey Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
rachel Hey! Hey what's going on?
joey Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
rachel Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
monica Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
chandler That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
joey Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in
monica Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
phoebe Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
monica And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
rachel Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.
phoebe Not Joey.
rachel Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
monica Yeah, right!
david So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.
chandler Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
david Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
chandler Nice!
chandler Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
monica Ok!
chandler David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
monica See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
chandler That would be advice!!
monica Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
phoebe Yeah?
monica I need to talk to you.
phoebe Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
monica Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
phoebe Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
monica What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
phoebe Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it
monica Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
phoebe Sure! Look, ok, bottom line
ross By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
charlie It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
ross Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
joey Hey guys!
ross The chocolates aren't here yet.
joey Damnit!
charlie Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
chandler Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
ross If you want to check your email, just ask!
chandler What? May I?
rachel What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
charlie Actually the wet season is June to December.
rachel It's not the time Charlie.
chandler Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
joey Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
chandler Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
ross Wha... what do you mean?
chandler It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
ross What, oh my God. What did you do?
chandler Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
ross Why, why would you open it?
chandler Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
ross What did it say?
chandler Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
ross What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
chandler It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
ross NO! I don't!!
chandler Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
joey It's really gone?
ross Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
chandler I just feel awful.
ross Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
chandler Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
ross Get out!
rachel You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
ross Well, what do you do?
rachel Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
ross I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
joey I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
ross I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
charlie Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
ross Wha... what you really think we can do that?
charlie Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .
joey Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
rachel Ugh.
ross Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
joey Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? .
mike Hello?
monica Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
mike Who is this?
monica This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
mike He... he's gonna propose?
monica I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
mike Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
monica You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
monica Well, I hope you're happy!
chandler Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
monica Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
chandler Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
monica No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
chandler And there's not chance that will work?
monica No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
chandler Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
monica Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
chandler This vacation sucks!!
joey I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
rachel Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
joey Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
joey Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
waiter I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
joey Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
rachel We can't. We're not pharmacists!
joey I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba...
rachel Kate Miller?
joey Kate Miller it is.
rachel And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
joey In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
rachel Thank you.
charlie And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
ross Yeah, that's it?
charlie Yeah.
ross Oh my God, we did it!
charlie Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
ross Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace.
charlie Thank you.
ross Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
charlie Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
ross Oh my God, I love you.
charlie Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
ross That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
charlie Your first marriage?
ross Yeah.
charlie You're married more than once?
ross No.
charlie So, why did you break up?
ross Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
charlie Oh my God, this is so cool!
ross Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
charlie No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
ross Hey! High-five!
charlie Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancÃ© was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
ross My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
charlie Right and then everybody finds out and they're like
ross I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note
charlie I know!
ross And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
charlie I didn't do that.
ross Me neither.
joey Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
rachel I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
joey Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
rachel Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
joey But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
rachel No.
joey There it is, you're blushing!
rachel No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
joey You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
rachel No.
joey Tell me who it is.
rachel Joey!
joey Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
rachel Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
joey What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
rachel Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
joey Yeah, who is that?
rachel Do ya?
joey Yeah.
ross_and_charlie Hey!
charlie I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
joey Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
ross Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
charlie I had a great time.
joey Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
rachel Later! La...
charlie So, shall we?
joey Yeah.
rachel Ok. See you, bye.
charlie Bye.
ross Good night.
joey Night.
ross_and_rachel Ok, good night!
monica I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
chandler You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
david Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
monica Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
chandler I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
david Uh, Phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
phoebe Sure, ok, yeah.
david But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
phoebe Oh my God, Mike!
david It's David, actually!
phoebe No, Mike's here.
david Hi Mike!
mike Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
monica IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
mike Hi Phoebe.
phoebe What are you, what are you doing here?
mike I have a question I need to ask you.
david I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
mike Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
david Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
mike Actually yeah, that'll be great.
david That's fair, you've had a long trip.
mike Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
david Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
mike Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
david Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
monica You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
david I have a ring.
chandler I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
david Phoebe, will you marry me?
phoebe No!
david Uhm... Ha ha!
phoebe I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
mike We can have any future you want.
david Ok, I'm gonna take off.
phoebe David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
david Just so I know, if I had asked first...
phoebe Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
david Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!
mike Is it ok if I hug you now?
phoebe Yes!
monica BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
