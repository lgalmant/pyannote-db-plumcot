chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller@rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Haaaa.... ahhhh!
chandler_bing Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Huh?
chandler_bing Skull?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
rachel_green Oh my god!!
phoebe_buffay No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
all@ Hey!
monica_geller Licorice?
dr_ross_geller Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
all@ Ohh! That's great!
monica_geller Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
dr_ross_geller Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
phoebe_buffay And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
rachel_green You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
dr_ross_geller Hmm.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
rachel_green Did you know he was in there?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing How long have we been home?
monica_geller About a half an hour.
chandler_bing Lovely!
chandler_bing Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Why not?
monica_geller Bing's weird.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hey, you guys!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
monica_geller Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
phoebe_buffay Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
chandler_bing Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, why not?
chandler_bing Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
phoebe_buffay Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
chandler_bing No reason, except...she...told...me.
phoebe_buffay Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
chandler_bing No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
monica_geller Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
phoebe_buffay You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
monica_geller Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
phoebe_buffay Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
chandler_bing Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
rachel_green Drums?
joey_tribbiani No! Drums!
chandler_bing Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
monica_geller I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
the_maitre_d Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
chandler_bing Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
the_maitre_d I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
chandler_bing Is this because of the burrito thing?
monica_geller You need to give him money.
chandler_bing Give him money? It was a joke!
monica_geller No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
chandler_bing Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
monica_geller You've got to be smooth about it.
chandler_bing Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
the_maitre_d Of course, sir.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller How did it go?
chandler_bing Had the money in the wrong hand.
dr_ross_geller Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
ben_geller No.
dr_ross_geller Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
ben_geller Christmas.
dr_ross_geller Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
ben_geller Christmas eve.
dr_ross_geller Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
ben_geller Santa has reindeers that can fly!
dr_ross_geller Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
ben_geller Jingle bells, jingle bells...
dr_ross_geller Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
ben_geller Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
dr_ross_geller Okay, it's not a contest.
ben_geller When is Santa coming?
dr_ross_geller Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
ben_geller No Santa? Was I bad?
dr_ross_geller No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
ben_geller Santa's mad at me.
dr_ross_geller No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
ben_geller So Santa's coming?
dr_ross_geller Yes! Santa's coming!
monica_geller It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
chandler_bing How do you know so much about this?
monica_geller I don't know.
chandler_bing Richard used to do it, didn't he?
monica_geller We'd be eating our soup right now.
chandler_bing Mustached bastard
monica_geller Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
chandler_bing Excuse me...
the_man Good evening.
chandler_bing Ahh-hahaha!
rachel_green Ha!
phoebe_buffay So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
joey_tribbiani@rachel_green Tequila!!
phoebe_buffay That's fun.
gunther Here you go.
chandler_bing Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
joey_tribbiani Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
chandler_bing Hey Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
monica_geller It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
phoebe_buffay Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
monica_geller Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
phoebe_buffay Maybe on some level.
rachel_green Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
joey_tribbiani What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
phoebe_buffay Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
joey_tribbiani Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
phoebe_buffay It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
rachel_green What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
joey_tribbiani Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
rachel_green Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
phoebe_buffay Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
rachel_green What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
phoebe_buffay Our apartment is ready.
rachel_green And that makes you angry because
phoebe_buffay Because you would rather live here with Joey.
rachel_green Where did you get that?
phoebe_buffay Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
rachel_green Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Hm?
rachel_green Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
phoebe_buffay Fish!
rachel_green It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
phoebe_buffay Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
rachel_green Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
phoebe_buffay We did have fun, didn't we?
rachel_green We did!
phoebe_buffay Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
rachel_green Oh, I would love to!
phoebe_buffay Yay, okay!
rachel_green Good, good, good, good, good.
phoebe_buffay Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
rachel_green Um... Done!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
the_salesman Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
dr_ross_geller No, these are my pants.
the_salesman Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
dr_ross_geller Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
the_salesman Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
dr_ross_geller Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
dr_ross_geller I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
monica_geller What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
dr_ross_geller Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
monica_geller Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
ben_geller Texas?
dr_ross_geller That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
ben_geller Wow! Thanks!
dr_ross_geller You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
ben_geller Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
dr_ross_geller You are? Me, too!
monica_geller Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
dr_ross_geller You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
ben_geller Cool!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
monica_geller Come on Ben.
dr_ross_geller Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
chandler_bing Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
ben_geller Santa!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller What are you doing here, Santa?
chandler_bing Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
dr_ross_geller I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
chandler_bing What?
ben_geller Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
chandler_bing You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
monica_geller Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
dr_ross_geller Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
chandler_bing Why?
dr_ross_geller Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
chandler_bing But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
chandler_bing Fine, I'll give the suit back.
monica_geller Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
chandler_bing Santa? Really?
monica_geller Yes, is that okay?
chandler_bing Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Then it's okay!
dr_ross_geller Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
ben_geller No! Why does he have to go?
chandler_bing Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo?.are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
ben_geller No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
dr_ross_geller Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
chandler_bing Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
ben_geller Okay, Santa!
dr_ross_geller All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
joey_tribbiani Merry Christmas!
rachel_green Oh wow! Look at this place!
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
rachel_green Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay What?
rachel_green Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
rachel_green And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
rachel_green Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
phoebe_buffay Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
rachel_green See?
phoebe_buffay Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
rachel_green You can't, because of the new skylight!
phoebe_buffay There's a skylight?! Wow!!
rachel_green So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
phoebe_buffay Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
rachel_green Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
phoebe_buffay A little bit, yeah.
rachel_green Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
phoebe_buffay You heard her too?! You have the gift!
rachel_green Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
phoebe_buffay Are you sure?
rachel_green Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
phoebe_buffay Oh me too.
rachel_green I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
phoebe_buffay No, I do not hear that.
dr_ross_geller ...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for
ben_geller Eight whole days.
dr_ross_geller That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
ben_geller Awesome!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
chandler_bing My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
dr_ross_geller The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Oh.
rachel_green Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
dr_ross_geller Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
rachel_green Oh.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
rachel_green I got it!
joey_tribbiani Is it back in the cage?
rachel_green Its back in cage!
joey_tribbiani Cage closed?
rachel_green Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
