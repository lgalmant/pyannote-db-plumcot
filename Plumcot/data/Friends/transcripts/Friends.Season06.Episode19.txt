joey_tribbiani Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
rachel_green I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
joey_tribbiani Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
rachel_green That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
joey_tribbiani All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
rachel_green You're jokin' right?
joey_tribbiani Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
rachel_green Thank God you're pretty.

all@ Hi! Hey!
rachel_green Do you guys know any cute guys?
chandler_bing Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
rachel_green Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go
monica_geller What's the charity?
rachel_green I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
monica_geller Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
rachel_green Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
phoebe_buffay Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
rachel_green Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.

dr_ross_geller Hey everybody!
all@ Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
elizabeth_stevens Oh hi!
all@ Hi!
elizabeth_stevens I'm the student.
chandler_bing Isn't she cute? No!
phoebe_buffay Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
elizabeth_stevens Oh, we're not together.
dr_ross_geller Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
phoebe_buffay Oh, sly.

chandler_bing So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
dr_ross_geller Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
chandler_bing Oh, tell her good luck with that.
dr_ross_geller Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
rachel_green Oo! When's her birthday?!
dr_ross_geller I don't know Rachel, why?
rachel_green Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
monica_geller Oh, I like Elizabeth.
dr_ross_geller Well thanks!
monica_geller Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
dr_ross_geller Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
monica_geller Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are

monica_geller Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
chandler_bing Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
chandler_bing Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
phoebe_buffay Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
chandler_bing Why would our guy be a weirdo?
phoebe_buffay 'Cause that's just your taste.
monica_geller Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah?
monica_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
chandler_bing A face ass?
phoebe_buffay A chin dimple!
monica_geller Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
phoebe_buffay Have you seen your guy's body?
chandler_bing No, our guy is just a floating head.
phoebe_buffay Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
monica_geller You're not supposed to look!
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
chandler_bing Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
phoebe_buffay I know.
monica_geller All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Chandler funny?
monica_geller Our guy's a great dancer!
phoebe_buffay My guy is well read.

monica_geller Do you want our guy to be your guy?
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Huh.
chandler_bing Well, you...don't look good Joe.
joey_tribbiani The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
chandler_bing That's still in there?!
joey_tribbiani Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
chandler_bing Is this a service you're providing me?
joey_tribbiani No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
chandler_bing Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
joey_tribbiani So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
chandler_bing Uh-huh.
joey_tribbiani And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
chandler_bing Okay
joey_tribbiani Give me $400!

dr_ross_geller Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
elizabeth_stevens I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
elizabeth_stevens Making out in your office.

dr_ross_geller You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
chandler_bing Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
dr_ross_geller I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
chandler_bing Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
joey_tribbiani Or! You can just, y'know
dr_ross_geller What the hell are you doing?
joey_tribbiani What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
dr_ross_geller What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
chandler_bing Joey, I saw you push him!
joey_tribbiani You pushed him!
dr_ross_geller Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
joey_tribbiani All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
chandler_bing Uh-huh.
joey_tribbiani I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
dr_ross_geller Do not give him any money!
joey_tribbiani I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
elizabeth_stevens You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
dr_ross_geller Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
dr_ross_geller Oo-oo!
elizabeth_stevens Doorknob?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
elizabeth_stevens Oh good.
dr_ross_geller Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
elizabeth_stevens Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
dr_ross_geller No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was
elizabeth_stevens You are so adorable.
dr_ross_geller That! Let's talk about that.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
dr_ross_geller Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
chandler_bing Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
dr_ross_geller What's-what's the difference?
monica_geller Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
phoebe_buffay What did you do on yours?
dr_ross_geller I went to Egypt with my dad.
chandler_bing I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
dr_ross_geller Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
monica_geller And slept with the professor.
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna call her.
chandler_bing Yeah.
rachel_green Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
sebastian Hi.
rachel_green We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
sebastian Can I get you a cup of coffee?
rachel_green Oh yes! Thank you!
phoebe_buffay Rachel, what the hell is this?!
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
rachel_green You found me a guy?
monica_geller Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
phoebe_buffay Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
rachel_green Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
chandler_bing Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
monica_geller Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
sebastian Here you go.
rachel_green Oh, thank you.
sebastian Sure.
phoebe_buffay So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
sebastian Uh, no not really. Why?
phoebe_buffay No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
chandler_bing Are you funny?
sebastian Excuse me?
rachel_green What are you guys doing?
monica_geller Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
sebastian Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
phoebe_buffay Well, so do a lot of people.
sebastian Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
rachel_green Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
sebastian Okay! See you later!
chandler_bing Turns out he is kinda funny.
rachel_green I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
chandler_bing Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
monica_geller All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
rachel_green All right.
chandler_bing Okay, so you will meet our guys?
rachel_green Yes, I'll meet 'em.
chandler_bing Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
phoebe_buffay Okay sure!
joey_tribbiani Really?!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
joey_tribbiani Call it even?
phoebe_buffay Okay.
chandler_bing Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
dr_ross_geller Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know
joey_tribbiani Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
chandler_bing You know the hotels?
joey_tribbiani Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
monica_geller In 1981 you were 13!
joey_tribbiani So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
dr_ross_geller Okay, she can't go.
phoebe_buffay Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
dr_ross_geller Then what am I supposed to do?
phoebe_buffay Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
dr_ross_geller Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
chandler_bing Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
dr_ross_geller I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
elizabeth_stevens Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
dr_ross_geller Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
elizabeth_stevens What?
dr_ross_geller Are you into crafts at all?
elizabeth_stevens Ross, are you okay?
dr_ross_geller Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
elizabeth_stevens It's a bathing suit?
dr_ross_geller To wear in front of people?
elizabeth_stevens Is that supportive?
dr_ross_geller Is this?!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Good-good-good-good.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
rachel_green Oh
monica_geller You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
rachel_green I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
chandler_bing Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Eldad, this is Rachel.

phoebe_buffay This is Patrick.
rachel_green Oh, hi.
patrick Hi.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
rachel_green Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
rachel_green Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
rachel_green I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
monica_geller No! You can't do that!
eldad Maybe I should go!
monica_geller Sit down! We're winning!
rachel_green Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
all@ No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
monica_geller Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
chandler_bing It is the softest hair! Touch it!
rachel_green Yeah, I'm good.
phoebe_buffay Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
patrick Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
monica_geller That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
chandler_bing Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
rachel_green No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
rachel_green I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
eldad I'm a little embarrassed.
rachel_green I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
phoebe_buffay Then why did she ask us to
rachel_green I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
eldad Yes, Papaya Extract.
rachel_green Thank you!
dr_ross_geller So uh, have a great time down there.
elizabeth_stevens I will.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
elizabeth_stevens Yeah.
dr_ross_geller It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
elizabeth_stevens Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
dr_ross_geller Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
elizabeth_stevens Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
dr_ross_geller Really?
elizabeth_stevens Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Cool.
elizabeth_stevens Oh hey! Here they are!
guy#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode19 Elizabeth!
dr_ross_geller Call me!
phoebe_buffay Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
rachel_green Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
chandler_bing So what was it for anyway?
rachel_green I wanna say a disease.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
all@ Hey!
joey_tribbiani I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
