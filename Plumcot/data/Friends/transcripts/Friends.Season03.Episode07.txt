dr_ross_geller So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
rachel_green I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
monica_geller Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
chandler_bing If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
gunther What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
phoebe_buffay Who's singing?
dr_ross_geller Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
monica_geller I was always Joanne.
joey_tribbiani Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
phoebe_buffay Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
joey_tribbiani Booo!!
chandler_bing Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
janice Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
mattress_king 'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
chandler_bing What a wank!
janice Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
monica_geller I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
mattress_king I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
rachel_green 'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
dr_ross_geller We?
rachel_green Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
dr_ross_geller Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
rachel_green Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
dr_ross_geller Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
rachel_green But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
chandler_bing I'll go.
dr_ross_geller Fine.
rachel_green Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Hi Gunther.
gunther Yeah, we'll see!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you guys!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Guess what?
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani I got a gig!
all@ Yay!!
chandler_bing See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
monica_geller What's the part?
joey_tribbiani Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
dr_ross_geller Come on! That's great.
all@ Wow!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
dr_ross_geller Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
joey_tribbiani I know!
phoebe_buffay Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
monica_geller Not at these prices.
phoebe_buffay Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
monica_geller Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
phoebe_buffay Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
joey_tribbiani Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
joey_tribbiani Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
joey_tribbiani Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
phoebe_buffay Ooooh, nice.
joey_tribbiani Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yay!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
phoebe_buffay Okay.

phoebe_buffay Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
joey_tribbiani You want me to lie to Chandler?
phoebe_buffay Is that a problem?
joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
joey_tribbiani Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
joey_tribbiani Ahh!
joey_tribbiani Hey now!
joey_tribbiani Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Oh! Oh!
joey_tribbiani Okay, great.

joey_tribbiani Okay.
phoebe_buffay 'Kay, put your head back.
joey_tribbiani All right. I can't see.
phoebe_buffay All right, I have ya. Oh God.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Gotcha.
rachel_green Hi Daddy!
dr_leonard_green This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
rachel_green You remember Ross.
dr_leonard_green Um-hmm.
dr_ross_geller Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
dr_leonard_green So! How's the library?
dr_ross_geller Ugh, museum.
dr_leonard_green What happened to the library?
dr_ross_geller There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
dr_leonard_green You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
rachel_green Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
dr_leonard_green What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
dr_ross_geller It's not a library...
dr_leonard_green I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
dr_ross_geller So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
dr_leonard_green They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
dr_ross_geller It gives it a nice antiquey look.
dr_leonard_green Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
dr_leonard_green Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay!
rachel_green Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
rachel_green Yeah. That's Daddy.
dr_ross_geller That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
rachel_green Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
dr_ross_geller So?
rachel_green So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
dr_ross_geller You really serve people sneezers?
rachel_green Well um, I don't.
dr_leonard_green You kids ready?
dr_ross_geller Thanks again, Dr. Green.
dr_leonard_green All right.
dr_leonard_green Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
dr_ross_geller Oh, ah, you don't need that.
dr_leonard_green Why not?
dr_ross_geller The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
dr_leonard_green What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
rachel_green Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
dr_ross_geller I know.
dr_leonard_green Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
rachel_green Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
dr_ross_geller Nothing I do means anything, really.
dr_leonard_green This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
dr_ross_geller Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
joey_tribbiani Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Hey, Mr. Trib.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey.
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Guess what, I got an audition!
joey_tribbiani Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
joey_tribbiani You bet! What's the part?
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
rachel_green You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
dr_ross_geller Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
rachel_green Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
rachel_green Um. yeah.
phoebe_buffay I am soo dead.
rachel_green All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
dr_ross_geller Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
rachel_green Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
dr_ross_geller Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
rachel_green Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
dr_ross_geller Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
rachel_green Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
monica_geller What's this?
phoebe_buffay Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
monica_geller This is not the bed I ordered!
phoebe_buffay I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
monica_geller Phoebe!
monica_geller Why is this car in my bedroom?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
monica_geller When did I sign for it?
phoebe_buffay When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
monica_geller Did you make brownies today?
chandler_bing Knock, knock.
monica_geller Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
chandler_bing Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
phoebe_buffay It's Monica's bed. What?
chandler_bing Okay. It's a racecar.
phoebe_buffay So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
chandler_bing Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
monica_geller Sometimes I have bad dreams.
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
joey_tribbiani Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 No.
joey_tribbiani Whoa. That was really good.
student#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode07 Thanks, any suggestions?
chandler_bing You told him to play the boxer gay!!
joey_tribbiani Well, I-I might've said supergay.
chandler_bing You totally screwed him over.
monica_geller Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
joey_tribbiani Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
phoebe_buffay Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
rachel_green Hi Daddy.
dr_leonard_green Baby. Ross.

rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
dr_leonard_green Ross? What's with the neck?
rachel_green He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
dr_leonard_green You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
dr_ross_geller Thank you! That's what I keep saying.

dr_leonard_green Oh God!
dr_ross_geller Argue with that.
rachel_green What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
dr_leonard_green Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
dr_ross_geller I know that!
dr_leonard_green So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
rachel_green I'm sorry, let her?
dr_ross_geller What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
dr_leonard_green Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
rachel_green No.
dr_leonard_green Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
dr_ross_geller Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
dr_leonard_green I'd love some juice. Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
rachel_green Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
dr_ross_geller Excellent!
joey_tribbiani There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
jester Uh, may I help you?
monica_geller Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
jester Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
joey_tribbiani All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
jester Nobody sees the king!
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
jester Hey! You can't go back there!
janice Oh my God.
chandler_bing Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
