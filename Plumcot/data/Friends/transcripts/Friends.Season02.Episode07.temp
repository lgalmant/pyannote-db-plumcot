chan OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
rach So, how was the party?
chan Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed
phoe No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
chan Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
phoe No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
mnca Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
chan Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
mnca Please.
all C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
chan Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
phoe Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
chan OK, let's do it. What?
mnca Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
chan And we're changing.
mnca C'mon give me five more. Five more.

mnca Five more and I'll flash you.
chan One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.

rach Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
phoe Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
joey The guy still won't put out, huh?
phoe Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
all Sorry Phoebs.
phoe Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
joey Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
phoe No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
joey Maybe he's. . . gay.
phoe Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
rach Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
phoe No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
mnca Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
chan Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
phoe Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.

joey Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
rach Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
joey But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
rach Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
chan So you really OK about all this?
rach Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
ross Hi guys.

mich Alright.
rach OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
phoe So, I figured it out.
joey What?
phoe Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
joey Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
phoe Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.

rach Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
mich Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."

ross Cat.
phoe Hey Joey.
joey Hey Phoebs.
phoe How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
joey I can't find the remote. Thank you.
phoe So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
joey And?
phoe And we did.
joey All right Phoebs, way to go.
phoe Yay me.
joey So, so how did it happen?
phoe Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
joey And what did he say?
phoe He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
joey Wow.
phoe Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
joey Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
phoe Um-hum.
joey This man is my God.
rach Hi.
ross I didn't get a cat.
rach Oh, that's um, interesting.
ross No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
rach Alright, I got it Ross.
ross You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
rach What?
ross I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
rach Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
ross Then you should have said something before I met her.
rach I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
ross There was never a good time.
rach Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
ross Not, not, not
rach Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
ross The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
rach Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
ross Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
rach Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
ross Fine.
rach 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
ross Good.
rach Good.
ross Try the bottom one.
chan Monica, it's 6
mnca No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
chan OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
mnca Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
chan Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
mnca Well, thanks.
chan I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
mnca Well, you know.
chan You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
mnca Uh-huh.
chan And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
mnca Well no, but um.
chan I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
mnca Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
chan So, you feel like goin' for a run?
mnca Alright.
chan Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
mnca OK. Just for a little while.
chan OK.
