stranger Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
rachel Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
stranger Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
rachel What?
stranger Hey, how, how did you do that?
joey This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
phoebe Well, I mean, I'm not
monica I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
phoebe I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
monica Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
ross You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
phoebe OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
monica Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
all Huuh.
monica Well, didn't you?
phoebe I might have.
monica I can't believe you didn't tell me.
phoebe Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
monica What have I not told you?
phoebe Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
rachel What!
monica Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
chandler I didn't know it was a big secret.
monica Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
phoebe You have a third nipple?
chandler You bitch.
ross Whip it out, whip it out.
chandler C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
rachel Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
joey I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
ross Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
joey I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
all Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
chandler Joey was in a porno movie.
all Huuh.
chandler If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
ross You were in a porno?
joey Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
monica That is wild.
ross So what's it shaped like?
phoebe Yeah, is there a hair on it?
joey What happens if you flick it?
ross So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
chandler Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
julie You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
chandler Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
ross You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
rachel Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
monica Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
rachel Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
all Woah.
joey Foxy lady.
julie Where you goin'?
phoebe Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
joey The Ice Capades?
chandler No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
monica I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
phoebe OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
ross Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
chandler Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
ross OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
julie See you later Rach.
rachel Bye-bye Julie.
rachel Hey.
ross Hey.
rachel Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
ross Hey?
rachel What?
ross Can I ask you somethin'?
rachel Sure.
ross Naa.
rachel What? C'mon, talk to me.
ross OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
rachel Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
ross Technically, huh, no.
rachel Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
ross No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
rachel No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
ross It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
rachel No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
ross What?
rachel I think it's sexy.
ross Sexy?
rachel Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
ross No kidding?
rachel Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
ross What?
rachel I'd wait.
ross You'd wait?
rachel Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
ross Really?
rachel Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
ross Women really want this?
rachel More than jewelry.

rachel Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
ross Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
rachel What did, what did he say?
ross Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
chandler What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
ross Pop it in.
joey I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
rachel Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
ross What's wrong with people having sex?
rachel Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
monica Hell, I wanna see Joey.
julie So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
chandler OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
monica All I say is, she better get the job.
ross Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
joey Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,
chandler Nice work my friend.

phoebe So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
duncan Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
phoebe Ohh. . .K. How come?
duncan Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
phoebe What?
duncan Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
phoebe Huuh.
duncan Yeah, I know, I.
phoebe I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
duncan I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
phoebe So how long have you known?
duncan Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
phoebe And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
duncan Her name's Debra.
phoebe Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
duncan Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
phoebe Sure.
duncan But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
phoebe I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
duncan I'm, I'm still me.
phoebe Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
monica You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
julie That saves us a conversation.
chandler Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
joey Me too, we should get goin'.
rachel No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
monica Rachel, that's all we do.
rachel Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
julie What about Julie?
rachel Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
julie Well, that could take a while.
rachel So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
chandler I got the time to get to know Julie.
joey I got time.
monica Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
rachel OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
julie Well, in a nutshell. . .
rachel Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
phoebe So, um, have you told your parents?
duncan No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
phoebe Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
duncan I love you Phoebe.
phoebe So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
julie And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
rahcel Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
julie No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
rachel Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
chandler I'm goin' home.
rachel What?
joey Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?

rachel So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
ross Oh, no no, I am.
rachel Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
ross Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
rachel Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
ross I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
rahcel OK, gook luck.
ross Wha, uhh, what?
rachel Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
ross OK, now I'm nervous.
rachel Maybe you should put it off.
ross No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
rachel I know, yeah, sorry.
ross What, it's not your fault.
rachel Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
ross Really?
rachel Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
ross Uh-huh.
rachel And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
ross Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
rachel Ohh, God.
ross Good morning.
old_woman Well, somebody got some last night.
ross Twice.
