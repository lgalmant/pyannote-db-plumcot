rachel_green Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
joey_tribbiani No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
chandler_bing Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
monica_geller That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
chandler_bing And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
monica_geller Oh yeah, right.
chandler_bing We got the honeymoon.
monica_geller That's not 'til Thursday.
chandler_bing The wedding pictures?
monica_geller They won't be ready for weeks.
chandler_bing Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
monica_geller That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
chandler_bing I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing What? What did you take a picture of?
joey_tribbiani Nothing! It was something.
chandler_bing Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
rachel_green Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
chandler_bing Oh.
monica_geller Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
rachel_green Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
chandler_bing Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
the_front_desk_clerk Here's a copy of your bill.
monica_geller Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
dr_ross_geller Hi.
chandler_bing Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
dr_ross_geller Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
chandler_bing Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
dr_ross_geller Thread!
chandler_bing Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
dr_ross_geller What disposable cameras?
chandler_bing The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
dr_ross_geller No you didn't.
chandler_bing Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that.
chandler_bing So you don't have the cameras?!
dr_ross_geller No. Sorry man.
chandler_bing So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
chandler_bing Great.
dr_ross_geller In-in three minutes.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
monica_geller No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
phoebe_buffay A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
monica_geller A tiny salt shaker!!!
phoebe_buffay Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
monica_geller Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah.
monica_geller Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
phoebe_buffay Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
monica_geller Or this one!
rachel_green Hi.
monica_geller Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
rachel_green Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
monica_geller No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
phoebe_buffay Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
rachel_green Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, 'cause I'm going to tell the father today.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
rachel_green Ew! No!
phoebe_buffay What?! I think he's cute.
rachel_green Well then you have his baby.
phoebe_buffay Believe me I'm trying.
monica_geller Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
rachel_green Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
phoebe_buffay Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.
rachel_green Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
monica_geller What was that bam?
phoebe_buffay I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
joey_tribbiani Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
rachel_green Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
joey_tribbiani Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah. That's me.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
joey_tribbiani Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
phoebe_buffay You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
joey_tribbiani Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
phoebe_buffay David Lynn.
joey_tribbiani David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
monica_geller Who's David Lynn?
phoebe_buffay Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
dr_ross_geller Chandler?
chandler_bing Hey! Did you find the cameras?
dr_ross_geller No. Did you?
chandler_bing Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
dr_ross_geller Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
chandler_bing Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
dr_ross_geller Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
chandler_bing All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
chandler_bing Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
dr_ross_geller No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
chandler_bing Are you serious?
dr_ross_geller I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
chandler_bing Marriage advice? Really?!
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
chandler_bing I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
dr_ross_geller What about the chairs?
chandler_bing She picked those out too.
dr_ross_geller How about the place settings?
chandler_bing That was her.
dr_ross_geller What did you do?
chandler_bing I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
dr_ross_geller Hmm.
phoebe_buffay Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
rachel_green Not yet.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
rachel_green No! Phoebe, it's not Gunther.
phoebe_buffay Thank God, 'cause that hair on a baby
rachel_green Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
phoebe_buffay Why not?
rachel_green I don't know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, 'I'm gonna tell the father today' and then bam!
phoebe_buffay Bus?
rachel_green No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
phoebe_buffay Well-well but it is huge.
rachel_green I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
phoebe_buffay You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
joey_tribbiani Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
monica_geller No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
joey_tribbiani Okay.
monica_geller Give me one more.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
phoebe_buffay All right.
joey_tribbiani Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
monica_geller Oh my God! Joey!
phoebe_buffay Hell yeah! I'll marry you!
monica_geller You can't marry him!
phoebe_buffay Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!
monica_geller Phoebe!
joey_tribbiani Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
phoebe_buffay I can and I will!
monica_geller She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
phoebe_buffay It's Joey!
joey_tribbiani Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
phoebe_buffay We don't know.
joey_tribbiani Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
monica_geller There's a dude?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Who? Who is it?
joey_tribbiani About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but
phoebe_buffay Was that story over?
joey_tribbiani The guy left this.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I know who the father is
monica_geller People have got to finish their stories!
chandler_bing Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
the_woman_at_wedding Oh! Of course.
the_man_at_wedding Uh, would you take one of us?
chandler_bing Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
the_woman_at_wedding It didn't click.
dr_ross_geller I heard it. I heard it.
the_man_at_wedding But there was no flash.
the_woman_at_wedding Why won't you take our picture?
chandler_bing Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
the_man_at_wedding Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
chandler_bing Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
phoebe_buffay Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
rachel_green What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
phoebe_buffay I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
rachel_green Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
rachel_green Uh, let's rip!
phoebe_buffay Really? Are you sure?
rachel_green Oh Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Okay, sorry. Yeah.
tag_jones Hey Rach.
chandler_bing Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay!
dr_ross_geller Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
the_anxious_wedding_guest That's my car!
dr_ross_geller A '95 LeSabre?!
the_anxious_wedding_guest Yes!
dr_ross_geller A green LeSabre?
the_anxious_wedding_guest Yes!

dr_ross_geller Well go! Go move it!
chandler_bing Okay, you ready for the last picture?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
tag_jones So, what's this about?
phoebe_buffay Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
tag_jones No. This is my red sweater.
phoebe_buffay Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
tag_jones What's going on Rach?
rachel_green Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
tag_jones Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
rachel_green Oh, it's just not the right time.
tag_jones It is the right time.
rachel_green Okay.
tag_jones I'm ready for more.
rachel_green Tag
tag_jones Come on Rach, let's give it another try.
rachel_green I'm having a baby.
tag_jones Oh.
rachel_green You can go.
tag_jones Thank you.
monica_geller I don't know how any of these got opened?!
joey_tribbiani You opened them all?
monica_geller I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
joey_tribbiani Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
monica_geller Yeah. What is that?
joey_tribbiani Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
monica_geller Hey! How'd it go?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
rachel_green Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
joey_tribbiani I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
rachel_green Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
monica_geller So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
rachel_green No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
rachel_green I'm not?
joey_tribbiani Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
rachel_green What?
monica_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay What?!!
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, give me the ring back!
phoebe_buffay No!!
rachel_green No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
joey_tribbiani I understand.
rachel_green Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
phoebe_buffay I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
joey_tribbiani Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered
phoebe_buffay Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
joey_tribbiani There you go!
chandler_bing We're back!
monica_geller Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
chandler_bing It's picture time.
dr_ross_geller Now you are going to love these.
chandler_bing Here's a picture of Ross. And that's me. And that's me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
monica_geller Wow! That is a great picture!
chandler_bing Eh?
monica_geller Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
dr_ross_geller Huh, didn't see that coming.
chandler_bing Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
monica_geller That would be a good idea.
chandler_bing Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
monica_geller You kissed another woman!
chandler_bing Call it even?!
monica_geller Okay!
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water.
phoebe_buffay Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
dr_ross_geller No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I've been looking for this for like a month!
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Oh my God!!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller Hey! How you doing?
tag_jones Good! Good, long time no see.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.

dr_ross_geller Oh hey, right back at ya.
tag_jones Oh, it's crazy about Rachel huh?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. She-Well, she's one crazy lady?
tag_jones So whose is it?
dr_ross_geller Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
tag_jones Okay.
dr_ross_geller He is so weird.
