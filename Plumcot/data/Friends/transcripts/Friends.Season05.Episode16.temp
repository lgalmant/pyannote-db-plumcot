joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
monica Hey!
joey What are you guys doing up?
chandler Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
joey Dark red.
chandler Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
monica Yes, you are so smart!
joey Aww, you guys are so cute!
monica I know.
joey All right, I'll see you in the morning.
chandler_and_monica Okay.
dream_monica Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
dream_joey Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
dream_monica Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
dream_joey Cat.
dream_monica Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
dream_joey I love you too.
rachel Uhh, we still need a tip.
phoebe All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
rachel A couple of bucks.
phoebe Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
monica Wow!
chandler Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
rachel Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
phoebe Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
joey Hey, you guys!
chandler Hey!
rachel Hey Joey!
monica Hey.
joey Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
monica Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
joey Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
monica I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
joey No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
monica Are you saying I smell bad?
joey No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
monica What's with him?
chandler Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
rachel Ugh!
ross Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
rachel What?! You say that to kids?!!
ross No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
rachel Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
the_salesman You picked a great couch.
ross Yeah?
the_salesman Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
ross Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
rachel Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
ross Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
rachel Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
ross Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
rachel Oh. Oh! I can do it!
ross Yeah!
the_salesman You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
ross Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
the_salesman Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
rachel Ross!
ross What's that supposed to mean?
rachel Ross!
the_salesman Well you, her, I mean, she's very... y'know. And you're like... y'know.
ross Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
the_salesman Really? You two?
ross Yeah! Rach?
rachel Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
ross Then tell him quickly.
rachel Fine! We went out.
ross Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
rachel Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
ross A loser you did it with 298 times!
phoebe Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
the_smoking_woman Yes?
phoebe You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
the_smoking_woman Yeah I can, it worked real well.
phoebe No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
the_smoking_woman I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
phoebe Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
the_smoking_woman What?!
phoebe Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
the_smoking_woman Who are you talking too?
phoebe Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
the_smoking_woman I am not going to apologize to a tree!
phoebe You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
the_smoking_woman I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
phoebe Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!

ross Good-good-good.
rachel Oh-oh!
ross Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
rachel Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
phoebe so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
monica Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
phoebe I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
chandler Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
phoebe You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey! Oh.
chandler Hi, Joe.
joey Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
monica Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
joey What?! Why?!
monica What is going on with you?
joey Nothing!
chandler Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
joey All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
chandler Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
joey Well, it involved Monica.
chandler You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
joey Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
monica What was the dream about?
joey Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
monica Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
joey It-it doesn't?
monica No!
chandler No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
joey That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
monica Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
joey In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
monica Um-hmm.
chandler Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
joey Not really.
chandler Well there you have it!
monica Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
joey No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
chandler Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
joey Friends first? That's interesting.
monica You become friends after?
joey No, never done that either.
rachel Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
chandler Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
monica That's right.
rachel What's up Joey?
joey How you doin'?
phoebe Excuse me, is this your car?
guy Yeah.
phoebe Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
guy Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
phoebe Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
guy So am I!
phoebe Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
cop Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
phoebe I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
cop Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
phoebe I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
cop Who-who else is in vice up there?
phoebe Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
cop Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
phoebe Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
cop No, I don't know him.
phoebe Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
cop Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
phoebe I-I sure will, take care.
cop Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
phoebe Oh.
rachel Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
joey Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
rachel Thanks!
joey Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
rachel I know.
joey Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
rachel What's up Joe?
joey Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
rachel Yeah?
joey is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So
rachel What are you saying?
joey I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
rachel Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
joey I'll treat you real nice.
rachel Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
joey Won't-won't that take longer?
rachel Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
joey Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
ross Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
rachel Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
ross Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
rachel Well, I brought the next best thing.
chandler Hey!
ross Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
chandler Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
ross Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
rachel Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
ross Oh, that's me.
rachel Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
ross No! That's-that's my arm!
chandler Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
ross Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
rachel Okay!
chandler Okay.
ross Come on, Chandler.
ross All right. Okay, here we go!
ross All right, ready?
chandler Yeah.
ross Turn.
chandler Okay.
ross Turn! Turn!
chandler Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
rachel Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
ross Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
chandler Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
ross Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
chandler_and_rachel You think?!
ross All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
chandler Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
ross I can't believe that didn't work!
rachel I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
chandler Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
joey Hey!
rachel Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
joey Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
chandler Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
joey Uhh, well, she's... really good in bed.
monica Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
joey Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
rachel What?! Why?!
joey Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
monica What about the closeness?
joey Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
joey All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
chandler Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
joey Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
monica Who is it?
voice N.Y.P.D!!
phoebe_and_joey Oh my God!
joey Uhh, just a minute officer!!
cop I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
phoebe Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
rachel Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
phoebe Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
cop Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
phoebe Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
cop I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
phoebe I would love it if I weren't here!
cop Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
phoebe Me?!
cop Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
chandler_and_joey Nice!
phoebe Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
cop Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
phoebe Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer
cop Gary.
phoebe Gary.
gary Okay, so it's a date.
phoebe Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
gary Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
phoebe Ohh, impressive.
gary Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
phoebe Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
gary Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
phoebe All right, I can't wait!
gary Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
chandler He has a gun!
ross I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
the_saleswoman You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
ross That's what I'm telling you.
the_saleswoman Did you cut this couch in half?
ross This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
the_saleswoman You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
ross Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
the_saleswoman I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
ross I take it.
