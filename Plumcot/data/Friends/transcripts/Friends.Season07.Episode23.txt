monica_geller Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
phoebe_buffay Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!

dr_ross_geller Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
chandler_bing What's up?
dr_ross_geller Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
chandler_bing Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
dr_ross_geller No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
chandler_bing But you're still my friend?
dr_ross_geller Not for the next few minutes.
chandler_bing During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
dr_ross_geller Nope.
chandler_bing Do I still call you Ross?
dr_ross_geller Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
chandler_bing Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
dr_ross_geller No problem.
chandler_bing So are we...friends again?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
rachel_green What 'cha doing Mon?
monica_geller I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
phoebe_buffay What are they?
monica_geller Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
rachel_green Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
monica_geller I had to go with the odds Rach.
joey_tribbiani Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?

the_director Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
joey_tribbiani No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
the_director I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
richard_crosby We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
monica_geller Honey, we gotta go!
chandler_bing Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
monica_geller I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.

So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.

monica_geller All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
rachel_green I'll do it.
monica_geller Who wants it? Anybody?
rachel_green I said I'll do it!
monica_geller Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
rachel_green Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
monica_geller Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
rachel_green Well of course that is what I'm here for!
monica_geller Okay. Sorry.
rachel_green Ugh! What grandmother?
joey_tribbiani Hey! Where have you been?
dr_ross_geller Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
dr_ross_geller What? Are you going back to work?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Nice shades.
joey_tribbiani Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
dr_ross_geller And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
joey_tribbiani Great! All right. I'll see you later.
dr_ross_geller Hey, where's Chandler?
joey_tribbiani Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
dr_ross_geller Chandler? Chandler?
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Is uh, is Monica here?
rachel_green She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
dr_ross_geller I think Chandler's gone.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller He left that.
rachel_green Tell Monica I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
rachel_green Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
phoebe_buffay Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller I think it means he freaked out and left!
phoebe_buffay Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
rachel_green Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
dr_ross_geller Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
dr_ross_geller I will, I will find him.
richard_crosby Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
joey_tribbiani Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
richard_crosby Just the last two pages.
joey_tribbiani All right.
richard_crosby I found the picture!
joey_tribbiani Picture? What picture?
richard_crosby Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
joey_tribbiani Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff
richard_crosby Oh, thanks.
joey_tribbiani But you're spittin' all over me man!
richard_crosby Well of course I am!
joey_tribbiani You know you've been spitting on me?!
richard_crosby That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!

judy_geller I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
dr_ross_geller Why?!
judy_geller The sexy blonde behind the counter.
dr_ross_geller Gunther?!
jack_geller Your mother just added him to her list.

judy_geller Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep
dr_ross_geller Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
jack_geller And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
the_director Action!
richard_crosby I found the picture!
joey_tribbiani What picture?!
richard_crosby The picture of my wife! In your pack!
joey_tribbiani You went through my personal property?
richard_crosby Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
joey_tribbiani Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
the_director Cut! Wonderful!
joey_tribbiani Great scene yeah?
richard_crosby Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
joey_tribbiani Thanks a lot.
the_assistant_director Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
the_assistant_director You are now.
joey_tribbiani No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
rachel_green Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Oh man.
rachel_green Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Well there's one down.
monica_geller I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
phoebe_buffay Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
monica_geller I'm gonna start getting ready!
rachel_green God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown
phoebe_buffay Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
rachel_green I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
rachel_green I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
rachel_green Oh!
phoebe_buffay No-no! I-I...I found one.
rachel_green Okay.
rachel_green Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
phoebe_buffay Sure. Do you need some floss?
rachel_green Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
phoebe_buffay Oh here's a whole bunch.
rachel_green Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
rachel_green Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
rachel_green Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
rachel_green No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
phoebe_buffay Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
rachel_green Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
phoebe_buffay Right.
rachel_green Okay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
rachel_green No. Why?
phoebe_buffay Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
rachel_green Anything?
dr_ross_geller No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
phoebe_buffay You told them he was missing?
dr_ross_geller No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
rachel_green All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
dr_ross_geller No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
rachel_green Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
dr_ross_geller Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
rachel_green All right, well how much time do you need?
dr_ross_geller Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
rachel_green One hour.
dr_ross_geller Give me two.
rachel_green Then why do you ask?!
dr_ross_geller Okay, wish me luck.
phoebe_buffay Okay. I'm going with you.
dr_ross_geller Why?!
phoebe_buffay Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
rachel_green All right, I'll see you guys later.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
rachel_green I'll figure something out.
phoebe_buffay All right. Good luck.
rachel_green Thanks.
monica_geller Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
rachel_green Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
monica_geller About what?
rachel_green Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
monica_geller Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
rachel_green No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
monica_geller Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
rachel_green Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
monica_geller Rachel! You okay?
joey_tribbiani Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
the_director Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
joey_tribbiani I'm having surgery!
the_director What?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
the_director What kind of surgery?!
joey_tribbiani Transplant.
the_director But you're supposed to work on Monday.
joey_tribbiani Hair transplant.
the_director But you're not bald.
joey_tribbiani It's not on my head.
the_director Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
joey_tribbiani Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
richard_crosby I'm wearing two belts.
joey_tribbiani Are you drunk?
richard_crosby No!
joey_tribbiani Yes you are!
richard_crosby All right.
dr_ross_geller We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Is that him?
dr_ross_geller That is an old, Chinese woman!
phoebe_buffay He could be in disguise, y'know.
dr_ross_geller Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
dr_ross_geller So this is your office?
chandler_bing How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
phoebe_buffay What the hell are you doing?!
chandler_bing Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
dr_ross_geller She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
chandler_bing No! No! No! I can't do that!
phoebe_buffay Why not?!
chandler_bing Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
dr_ross_geller What's wrong with being the Bings?
chandler_bing The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
dr_ross_geller Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
chandler_bing No.
dr_ross_geller Then you are neither of your parents!
chandler_bing It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
phoebe_buffay But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
chandler_bing I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
chandler_bing Well yeah, but then
dr_ross_geller Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
chandler_bing Depends on what you mean by we.
rachel_green The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again
monica_geller The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
rachel_green I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
monica_geller I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
rachel_green Okay. But wait!
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green Let's go to lunch.
monica_geller I can't go to lunch!!
rachel_green Right.
rachel_green Oh good God! I've fallen down!
monica_geller What's going on?
rachel_green Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
monica_geller Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
rachel_green We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
monica_geller How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
phoebe_buffay Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again
rachel_green Oh!
monica_geller Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
joey_tribbiani I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
richard_crosby That can be arranged.
the_director Let's reset.
joey_tribbiani What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
the_director Let's take it from there.
richard_crosby Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
joey_tribbiani Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
richard_crosby Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
joey_tribbiani Thank you. Thank you.
the_director Still rolling, annnnd action!
joey_tribbiani I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
richard_crosby Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
phoebe_buffay So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
judy_geller Here comes the bride.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God Monica!
monica_geller I wanna wear this everyday.
rachel_green You look so beautiful.
monica_geller I'm so happy for me.
rachel_green Hello?
joey_tribbiani Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
rachel_green Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
joey_tribbiani Damnit!
rachel_green What? Why? Where are you?
joey_tribbiani I'm still on the set!
rachel_green Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
joey_tribbiani I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
rachel_green Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
joey_tribbiani No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
rachel_green Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
dr_ross_geller There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
chandler_bing No.
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
chandler_bing Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
dr_ross_geller Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
chandler_bing Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Okay, excuse me for a minute.
dr_ross_geller Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
chandler_bing Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Okay.
chandler_bing Oh fresh air!
phoebe_buffay Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
rachel_green Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
rachel_green Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
the_rabbi#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode23 I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
rachel_green Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
dr_ross_geller Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
jack_geller I thought he was with you.
dr_ross_geller He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
jack_geller You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
dr_ross_geller You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
judy_geller Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
nora_tyler_bing As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
charles_bing But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
nora_tyler_bing Honey, it isn't good luck.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Monica!
monica_geller I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
dr_ross_geller Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
monica_geller Are you okay?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh.
monica_geller Well, you're-you're sweating.
dr_ross_geller These-these are beads of joy.
monica_geller Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
dr_ross_geller Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
phoebe_buffay What's going on?
dr_ross_geller Chandler's gone again!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
joey_tribbiani Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
the_director I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
richard_crosby You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
joey_tribbiani So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
richard_crosby Well have we finished the scene?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
richard_crosby As were you.
joey_tribbiani So I got your car, it's right outside.
richard_crosby Why? Are we done for the day?
joey_tribbiani That's what you told me.
richard_crosby Oh, thank you. You're welcome.

dr_ross_geller You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
chandler_bing Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
chandler_bing That's right! I'm not!
dr_ross_geller Then where the hell have you been?!
chandler_bing I know about Monica.
phoebe_buffay You know?!
dr_ross_geller What?

dr_ross_geller Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
chandler_bing Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes
dr_ross_geller@phoebe_buffay Cigarettes?!!
chandler_bing Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
phoebe_buffay Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
chandler_bing But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
dr_ross_geller Dude.
jack_geller Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
charles_bing Our little boy is getting married.
nora_tyler_bing Oh look at you! So handsome!

the_rabbi#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode23 Are you Chandler?
chandler_bing Are you Joey?
dr_ross_geller Huh. This is nice.
phoebe_buffay What?
dr_ross_geller I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
judy_geller Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
monica_geller She's right there.
judy_geller Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
jack_geller I love you sweetheart.
chandler_bing You look beautiful. Is this new?
monica_geller Not now.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Who is this?
the_rabbi#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode23 I am Father Kalebasous.
chandler_bing He's Greek Orthodox.
rachel_green As are you
the_rabbi#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode23 Let us begin. Dearly beloved
joey_tribbiani That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
monica_geller He took off?
rachel_green Go on! Go on.
monica_geller Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
joey_tribbiani Chandler?
chandler_bing No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
joey_tribbiani You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
chandler_bing I do.
monica_geller I do.
joey_tribbiani Yeah you do!
dr_ross_geller Rings?
joey_tribbiani Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
joey_tribbiani We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
chandler_bing I love you. And I know about the baby.
monica_geller What baby?
chandler_bing Our baby.
monica_geller We have a baby?
chandler_bing Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
monica_geller I didn't take a pregnancy test.
chandler_bing Then...who did?
phoebe_buffay Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
rachel_green Uh-huh.
