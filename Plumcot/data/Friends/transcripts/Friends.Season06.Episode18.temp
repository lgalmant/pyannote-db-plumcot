ross Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
chandler Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
rachel Who wrote it?
ross Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
joey Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
ross Yeah.
joey Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
chandler A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
rachel Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
ross It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
chandler Oh, is that against the rules?
ross No, but it is frowned upon.
chandler I see.
ross Besides, there's a big age difference.
joey Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90
ross I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
joey No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
joey Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
chandler Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
phoebe What's a Movement class?
monica It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
joey Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
chandler Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
joey No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
chandler You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred
joey Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
chandler Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
joey All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
chandler Yeah so, Tuesday?
joey Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
chandler Thank you.
joey Okay.
rachel Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
chandler You just thought of that in there?
monica Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
rachel Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
monica You're on the phone!
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
phoebe Oh my God! How bad was it?
rachel Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
monica Come on!
chandler What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
joey The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
burt Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
elizabeth Professor Geller?
ross Yeah?
elizabeth I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
ross Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
elizabeth Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation
ross That was you?
elizabeth Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
ross Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
elizabeth Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
ross What time?
elizabeth Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
ross Gotcha.
elizabeth I'm kidding!
ross Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
phoebe Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
monica Oh well, it's not so bad.
fireman_1 Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
phoebe Oh!
rachel My God!
joey Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
fireman_1 Excuse me?
monica Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
joey Oh, how bad is it?
phoebe Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
chandler How's your room Rach?
rachel Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
monica Isn't that mine?
rachel Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
fireman_1 So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
rachel Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
monica Yes, they can stay with us.
chandler Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
fireman_1 Well uh, do either of you smoke?
phoebe No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
fireman_1 No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
phoebe Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
rachel Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
chandler God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
joey Chandler, is that
chandler Oh that's great! Good for you.
joey Hey-hey listen
chandler Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
joey When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
chandler Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
joey Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
chandler Hi.
monica Hey!
chandler We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
joey Ah-ha!
monica Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
chandler Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
monica You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
chandler No, we only went out once.
monica You dated her!
chandler Not once!
monica All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
joey Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
chandler Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
dana Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
chandler My friend's name is Joey.
dana Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
chandler Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
dana No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
chandler The nerve huh?
dana Yeah!
chandler Refill?
monica Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
rachel Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
monica I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
phoebe Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
rachel Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
phoebe Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
rachel Okay!
monica So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
rachel I have.
joey This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
phoebe What's that smell?
joey I know!
elizabeth Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
ross What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
elizabeth Who?
ross Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
elizabeth Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
ross Umm, no. No.
elizabeth Yes you did! What was it?
ross Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
elizabeth Ohh that's so sweet!
ross Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
burt Dr. Geller!
ross Burt!
phoebe So did you sleep well last night?
rachel I did.
phoebe Yeah?
rachel I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
phoebe Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
rachel What?
phoebe Gum!
fireman_2 Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
phoebe Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
fireman_2 No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
phoebe I don't use a curling iron.
fireman_2 Well someone does.
rachel Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
fireman_2 It could've been a hair straightener.
rachel Oh.
joey This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
monica Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
phoebe Thanks Monica!
monica Does that smell bother you?
phoebe What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
monica Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
phoebe I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
monica Okay!
phoebe Okay.
monica Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
phoebe Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
joey Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
ross We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
monica So it's okay to date a student.
ross Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
monica Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
ross Yeah. What-what should I do?
joey Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
monica Joey that is so sweet.
chandler Hey.
joey Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
chandler I couldn't do it.
joey You couldn't do it?!
chandler Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
monica What?! You're going out with her again!
ross Going out with who?
chandler Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
ross Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh
chandler No, that was Dana Caplin.
the_guys Ohhhh!
monica Joey! You didn't even know her!
joey Ah whatever!
chandler Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
dana Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
chandler Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
dana Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
chandler Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
dana I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
chandler No-no-Really?!
dana Of course!
chandler Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
dana Ohh, I'm sorry.
chandler Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
dana What?! Anything! Anything!
chandler Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
dana Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
chandler Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
monica Hey! How's it goin'?
phoebe Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
monica Yes it has! I made cookies!
phoebe Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
monica But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
phoebe Okay.
monica Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
phoebe Okay, I'll be out in a second.
monica Okay!
monica What are you doing?
phoebe That doesn't lock does it?
rachel Oh, Joey! Sorry!
joey No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
rachel Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
joey Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
rachel Really?
joey Yeah! Look!
rachel I've never lived like this before.
joey I know.
joey All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
ross What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
elizabeth Uhh, I can't.
ross Oh, you have some studying to do?
elizabeth No, I have some turning 21 to do.
ross Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to
elizabeth What are you doing?
ross Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
elizabeth Do you not want to be seen with me?
ross What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
elizabeth Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
ross What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
elizabeth Hi!
lydia Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
ross That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
mel You are so fired.
ross What?
burt They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
ross Really? Its not just frowned upon?
rachel I love it at Joey's!
joey Hey, here you go.
chandler Ni-hi-ice!
rachel Thanks!
chandler So, you busy Thursday?
joey Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
chandler Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
phoebe Hey! Hi!
rachel Hi!
phoebe Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
rachel Uh-huh.
phoebe Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
rachel No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
phoebe Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
chandler Really?
phoebe Yeah she said something about crumbies.
chandler No! No! No! I was so careful!
phoebe Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
joey That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
rachel No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
phoebe No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
rachel I know. I'm sorry.
phoebe All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
joey Yeah.
phoebe God, what a mess.
ross Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
elizabeth For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
ross I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
elizabeth Wow!
ross What?
elizabeth Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
ross Really?
elizabeth Yeah.
ross Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
elizabeth Stop it!
ross No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
elizabeth Shut the book!
ross Let's also get a hot plate!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey!
chandler So?!
joey So?
chandler It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
joey Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
