rachel_green Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.
joey_tribbiani I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
monica_geller You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
phoebe_buffay Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
joey_tribbiani Here it is, here it is. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
chandler_bing OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
phoebe_buffay OK. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
chandler_bing Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
dr_ross_geller I don't want to.
rachel_green Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
dr_ross_geller Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
monica_geller Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... sucking.
joey_tribbiani When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
dr_ross_geller Hiiiiii.
phoebe_buffay Are... are you OK?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
monica_geller Maybe.
dr_ross_geller Don't toy with me.
fun_bobby Geller!
dr_ross_geller Hey, Fun Bobby!
fun_bobby Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
dr_ross_geller Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
monica_geller You and me both.
fun_bobby Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
phoebe_buffay Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
fun_bobby Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
joey_tribbiani No, I'm alright man. Really.
fun_bobby No, I'm picking you up.
joey_tribbiani Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
fun_bobby OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
monica_geller OK, I'll see you later babe.
fun_bobby Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
fun_bobby See ya.
all@ Bye! See you later!
phoebe_buffay Fun Bobby is so great.
monica_geller Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
phoebe_buffay Half full of looooovvvvve.
monica_geller And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
phoebe_buffay Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
rachel_green We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
monica_geller Really? I only had two glasses.
joey_tribbiani I just had a glass.
phoebe_buffay Two.
rachel_green I had one glass.
chandler_bing I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
rachel_green OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
dr_ross_geller Oooooh.
joey_tribbiani Ooooooh.
monica_geller So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
dr_ross_geller Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
joey_tribbiani Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
monica_geller Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
monica_geller Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
rachel_green Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
monica_geller Mmmm, no.
rachel_green Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
fun_bobby Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
phoebe_buffay Um, cake.
rachel_green Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
monica_geller You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
fun_bobby Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
monica_geller Bobby.
fun_bobby Yeah, OK.
monica_geller Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
fun_bobby OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
monica_geller So, what are you saying now?
fun_bobby I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
phoebe_buffay Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
fun_bobby I am gonna try and quit drinking.
phoebe_buffay Ooohh, why?
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
chandler_bing Guess who's back in show business.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
chandler_bing No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
phoebe_buffay Oh, no.
chandler_bing OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
chandler_bing Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
rachel_green Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
monica_geller You have other friends?
rachel_green Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
monica_geller What?
joey_tribbiani With a man?
rachel_green What? What is so strange about me having a date?
joey_tribbiani What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
rachel_green Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
monica_geller What are you talking about?
rachel_green I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
phoebe_buffay But you guys came so close.
rachel_green Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
rachel_green Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
dr_ross_geller Hhhhiiiii.
estelle_leonard Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
estelle_leonard Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
joey_tribbiani Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
estelle_leonard Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
joey_tribbiani No.
estelle_leonard Well, here it is.
joey_tribbiani OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
estelle_leonard Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
estelle_leonard Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
rachel_green What's the matter?
monica_geller It's Fun Bobby.
rachel_green What, isn't he sober?
monica_geller Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
rachel_green Ohhh, OK.
monica_geller Alright, here you go, sweetie.
fun_bobby Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
monica_geller Oh God, yes!
fun_bobby There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
phoebe_buffay That is funny.
fun_bobby I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
monica_geller Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
fun_bobby Oh yeah. See you guys.
chandler_bing Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
monica_geller Oh.... my... God.
phoebe_buffay It's not that bad.
monica_geller Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
phoebe_buffay OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
rachel_green Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
monica_geller But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
phoebe_buffay Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
chandler_bing Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
rachel_green Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
dr_ross_geller OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
phoebe_buffay Rachel? Um, hi.
rachel_green Hi.
phoebe_buffay OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
rachel_green Uhh.... waitressing?
phoebe_buffay Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
rachel_green Huh, Bob Saget?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
phoebe_buffay Oh, my, oh!
dr_ross_geller What? What's wrong?
phoebe_buffay I, OK....
monica_geller She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
dr_ross_geller Alright.
chandler_bing Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
dr_ross_geller Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
dr_ross_geller A date.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm her date.
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
chandler_bing You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
dr_ross_geller Periodontist.
monica_geller See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
dr_ross_geller Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
dr_ross_geller Ditto.
dr_ross_geller I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
rachel_green Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
dr_ross_geller Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
rachel_green Well, yeah, this is the deal.
dr_ross_geller OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
rachel_green Um, Russ, you ready?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Bye.
monica_geller Bye.
phoebe_buffay Bye.
dr_ross_geller She's dating. She's dating.
chandler_bing Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
dr_ross_geller What do you mean?
monica_geller Do you not see it?
dr_ross_geller See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
chandler_bing Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
dr_ross_geller ...................Yeah.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
joey_tribbiani Well, the part's mine if I want it.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
chandler_bing Oh my... God?
joey_tribbiani Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
chandler_bing So, what're you gonna do?
joey_tribbiani Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
chandler_bing Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
joey_tribbiani I've never slept with someone for a part.
chandler_bing Well is she...
joey_tribbiani Sorry.
chandler_bing It's alright. Is she good-looking?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
chandler_bing Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
joey_tribbiani I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
chandler_bing Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
waiter Can I get you something from the bar?
monica_geller Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
fun_bobby If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
monica_geller No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
fun_bobby So the light went out in my refrigerator...
monica_geller I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
chandler_bing Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
dr_ross_geller Dysprosium.
dr_ross_geller Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
chandler_bing And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
phoebe_buffay You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay OK honey, you're dating Ross.
rachel_green No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
phoebe_buffay Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
rachel_green Steve... sleeve!
phoebe_buffay OK, noone is named Sleeve.
rachel_green Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
dr_ross_geller For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
dr_ross_geller You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
chandler_bing OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
dr_ross_geller I know what your problem is.
dr_ross_geller Oh you do, do you?
dr_ross_geller Um-hum, you're jealous.
dr_ross_geller Of... of what?
dr_ross_geller You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you listen.
dr_ross_geller No, no, let me finish.
dr_ross_geller No, let me finish.
dr_ross_geller No, you let me fini...
dr_ross_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
rachel_green Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
chandler_bing No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
rachel_green I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
chandler_bing Me.
rachel_green Why would I have to sleep with you?
chandler_bing It's my game. You want the job or not?
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Morning.
dr_ross_geller Where ya goin'?
monica_geller Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
dr_ross_geller Ooooohhhh.
phoebe_buffay What's with all the bottles of liquor?
dr_ross_geller What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
monica_geller Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
rachel_green Oh God, even his knock is boring.
monica_geller Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
fun_bobby Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
monica_geller Sure.
fun_bobby This is really hard for me to say.
monica_geller Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
fun_bobby Oh, no, no, it's about you.
monica_geller What about me?
fun_bobby I think you may have a drinking problem.
monica_geller What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
fun_bobby Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
monica_geller Oh... shoot.
fun_bobby Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
monica_geller OK.
monica_geller Take care.
fun_bobby You too.
rachel_green What happened?
monica_geller Well we... we kinda broke up.
gang#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode10 Awwwwwwww.
monica_geller Does anybody want these?
chandler_bing I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
gang#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode10 Hey!
dr_ross_geller How'd the callback go?
joey_tribbiani It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
chandler_bing So what'd you do?
joey_tribbiani Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
dr_ross_geller Good for you.
joey_tribbiani But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
phoebe_buffay So... and?
joey_tribbiani Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
gang#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode10 Allright!
joey_tribbiani Alright... I've got to go shower.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
chandler_bing Oh, hey.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
dr_ross_geller I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm sorry man.
dr_ross_geller Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
phoebe_buffay Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
julie Hey.
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
julie Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
