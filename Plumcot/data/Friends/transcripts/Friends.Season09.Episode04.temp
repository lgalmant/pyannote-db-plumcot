ross of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.

rachel Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
rachel yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
joey Hey

joey yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
rachel what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
joey and who's fault is that.
joey HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
rachel yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
joey Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY!

phoebe HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
ross YAY! quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
phoebe What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
ross oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
phoebe WHAT!
ross umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
phoebe WHAT! WHY?
ross well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
phoebe If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
ross well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah.
phoebe I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
ross Good yeah just be honest with him.
phoebe yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
ross I'll get it
phoebe ok
mike You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?
phoebe Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
hayley so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.
joey Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
hayley What?
joey How could you not remember that we slept together?
hayley What! When?
joey I dunno!
hayley I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
joey come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
hayley no it's not ringing any bells.
joey my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
hayleys_roommate Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
joey Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
phoebe .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
mike But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
phoebe yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
mike that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
phoebe I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
mike I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
phoebe Oh.
mike and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
phoebe ok I can't do this.
mike what's wrong?
phoebe well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me.
mike uh huh
phoebe so you don't think I'm a total freak
mike No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
phoebe I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
mike Definitely
ross This is Vicrum.
chandler Hi honey I'm home!
chandler oh it was great.
chandler well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
chandler Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
chandler no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
chandler does what always have to be sharks.
chandler What's going on?
chandler let ME be a part of this!
chandler no they don't
chandler OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn
chandler yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
chandler You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
joey see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
phoebe you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
joey your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with her.
