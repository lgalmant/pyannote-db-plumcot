ross Hey you guys I got some bad news.
phoebe Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
ross No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
joey Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
monica Hey!
chandler Hey.
monica Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
ross Umm
monica Oh dear God!
ross But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
monica What about the rest of Manhattan?!
ross Yeah, they all know.
monica Oh my God, this is horrible!
chandler I'm so sorry.
monica I'm so humiliated!
rachel Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
monica You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
rachel I didn't write it.
monica Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
all No!
joey Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
rachel Ross!
ross What?! What?
rachel I am freaking out!
ross Are ya?
rachel My due date is in one week!
ross What are you doing up?
rachel That is seven days!
ross Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after
rachel No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
ross It's funny you should mention diapers.
rachel I'm serious.
ross Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
rachel Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little
ross Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. So
rachel Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
ross Yeah!
rachel Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
ross Well uh
rachel I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
joey Hey uh Monica, I can't remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
monica We said at the movies, but
joey Okay, I'll see you there.
monica Joey! Now that you're here
joey Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?
chandler I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
joey I thought you already have a job.
chandler And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
joey Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
chandler That's what I do now.
monica Hey Joey, come taste this.
joey What is it?
monica Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
joey You cooked him?
monica No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
chandler The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
cashier Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
rachel Oh.
ross Oh.
rachel No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
ross We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
cashier Why don't you fill out this address card.
ross Oh, okay.
cashier I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
rachel Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
ross I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
cashier Really?! That is so cool!
rachel Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
cashier Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
ross Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
rachel Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
cashier Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
ross That's my gym.
cashier I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones.
ross I am like Indiana Jones.
rachel Hi Pheebs!
phoebe Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
rachel Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.
phoebe What?!
rachel Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
phoebe Well did she know you two weren't married?
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
rachel You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
phoebe Sounds like you're a little jealous.
rachel No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!
phoebe Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
chandler Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
phoebe Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
chandler Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
phoebe Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
chandler Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
rachel Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
phoebe Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.
chandler Why not?
phoebe Well, the interview
chandler What about it?
phoebe Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
chandler What?!
phoebe Oh you don't know.
chandler Are you serious?!
phoebe Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
chandler What is it that I do?
phoebe Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
chandler Did you like me when we first met?
rachel Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
monica Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
the_food_critic Still?
monica I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
the_food_critic I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
joey Either eat it, or be in it.
monica Spoon? So, what do you think?
the_food_critic I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
joey Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
the_cooking_teacher Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
monica I can.
the_cooking_teacher Okay, go ahead.
monica Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
the_cooking_teacher That's very good, what's your name?
monica Monica.
the_cooking_teacher Monica, you go to the head of the class.
monica Okay.
rachel All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
ross My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?
katie Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
ross Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
katie Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
ross Oh.
katie Oh uh...I actually came here to ask you out.
ross Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
katie Sure!
rachel Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
rachel So you guys go, have a really good time.
ross Yeah, I'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Y'know because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M. I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex. So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
rachel So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
katie Are you okay with this?
rachel Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
katie Okay. It was nice to see you.
rachel Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
katie Oh umm, actually I umm
rachel Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
chandler I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
phoebe Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
chandler Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
phoebe All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
chandler An hour.
phoebe I can't help you.
chandler Phoebe!
phoebe All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
chandler Chandler Bing.
phoebe Bing, what an unusual name.
chandler Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
joey Hi.
the_cooking_teacher Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
joey When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
the_cooking_teacher And the cream?
joey Cheese makes me thirsty.
the_cooking_teacher Okay. Let's move on.
joey All right.
the_cooking_teacher Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station! Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
monica Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
the_cooking_teacher Well, hats off to the chef.
monica I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
the_cooking_teacher The chef!
monica That's right.
chandler ...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
phoebe Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
chandler What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
phoebe I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
chandler Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
phoebe You gotta go!
chandler Oh!
phoebe Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
chandler Really?
phoebe Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
chandler Okay.
the_cooking_teacher Ah Monica, my star student.
monica Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
the_cooking_teacher Oh, yum-yum-yum.
monica Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
the_cooking_teacher Okay Joey, you're up next. This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
joey I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
monica Joey! I'm so proud of you!
the_cooking_teacher I think you should give him your star.
monica Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
the_cooking_teacher We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
monica I do! I'm a professional chef! Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!
the_cooking_teacher If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
joey Yeah!
monica I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review
the_cooking_teacher Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!
monica You do?
the_cooking_teacher Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little
monica Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
the_cooking_teacher Very much.
monica Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay.
joey Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
the_cooking_teacher Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
joey Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
chandler ...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
the_interviewer You must've had your hands full.
chandler That I did. That I did.
the_interviewer So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
chandler My duties? All right.
the_interviewer Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
chandler I see.
the_interviewer But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
chandler Good to know.
the_interviewer We can go into detail
chandler No don't I beg of you!
the_interviewer All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
chandler Really?!
the_interviewer Absolutely. You can relax; you did great.
chandler Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
the_interviewer Poo?
chandler Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
the_interviewer Poo?!
chandler I'll look forward to your call.
ross Hey.
rachel Hi! You're back from your date!
ross How are you?
rachel I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
ross Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
rachel Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
ross What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
rachel No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
ross I liked her.
rachel Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
ross Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
rachel No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
ross Why? What was wrong with her?
rachel There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
ross Okay, so what's the matter?
rachel I don't want you to date her!
ross Why? What, what are you jealous?
rachel Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
ross Okay.
rachel What?!
ross I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
rachel Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
ross True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
rachel Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you.
ross Do you feel better?
rachel No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
ross Uh Rach?
rachel Yeah.
ross Just one thing umm
rachel Uh-huh.
ross We live together. You're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
rachel Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm
ross Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?
rachel I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
ross Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
rachel Oh no-no-no-no, no!
ross ...that you actually
rachel No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
ross Rach?
rachel Yeah?
ross The bathroom?
rachel Right!
joey Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
monica Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
joey What the hell!
monica Okay.
the_acting_teacher All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
joey Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
