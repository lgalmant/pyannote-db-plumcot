phoebe So now, what is this now?
joey Guggly worm.
phoebe And this?
joey Glow-pop giggly jammer.
phoebe You make it so funny.
monica Hey umm, what's this?
joey Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
ross Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and - Someone knocked over a lamp.
joey That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
all Great!
chandler You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
monica Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
joey Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
monica What's Phase Two?
joey Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
rachel How does going to a strip club help him better?
ross Because there are naked ladies there.
joey Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
ross There are naked ladies there too.
joey Yeah.
chandler Would you give me one minute!! Please.
joshua So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
rachel Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.

rachel Yeah! That would be great!
joshua You're into hardcore S&M right?

joshua Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
rachel Yeah, great, you betcha!
mr_waltham I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
rachel What?

rachel Oh. Oh, right.
mr_waltham I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
rachel Oh yay!
chandler Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
ross Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
joey Hey-hey!
ross Hi!
phoebe Hey!
ross Catch any big fish?
joey Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
all Oh! God! Wow!
monica You stink!
ross Are you kidding?!
joey Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
ross He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
joey Hey buddy! How's it going?
joey Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
rachel Hey!
ross Hey!
rachel Hey, Monica!
monica Uh-oh, what's the matter?
rachel Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
monica I don't know sweetie.
rachel No! Help me!
monica I can't! I have to work!
rachel Phoebe?
phoebe I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
rachel Ugh!
phoebe Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
rachel Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is - I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
monica No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
rachel Ohh! Hi!
ross Hi!
rachel So... .
ross No.
rachel Ohhhh, come on!!!
monica I think she's here.
rachel No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
ross You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
monica Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
woman Hello!
rachel I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
ross All right, I'll do it.
rachel Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
emily Yes.
rachel I'm Rachel Green.
emily Thank goodness.
rachel There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So
emily Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
rachel Oh well, no I
emily Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
monica I-I-I think you look great.
emily Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
rachel I'll get her.
ross Please hurry.
phoebe Don't you just love the way they talk?!
phoebe Ohh!
monica What?
phoebe It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
joey Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
monica Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
joey Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
monica Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
rachel Hey - whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
monica So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
rachel Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
monica What?
phoebe Why?
rachel The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
phoebe Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
rachel No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
monica So you hit her in the face?
rachel No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
phoebe Aww, Pheebs.
rachel Honey, that's you're name.
phoebe That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
monica Hey! You're wearing pants!
chandler That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
monica It's 9
chandler They got a breakfast buffet.
monica Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
chandler Ooh, let me talk to him!
monica Oh-oh, my God!
chandler Well, can I just
monica Shh!! Wait, what?
chandler She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
phoebe Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
monica He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
phoebe What? Oh my God!
rachel What? Who the hell is Emily - noooo!!
rachel They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
chandler Ow!
rachel How - how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
chandler Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
ross When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
emily Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
ross I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
monica He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
rachel I don't get this! She was horrible!
chandler Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
monica Why do you care so much anyway?
rachel I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that - y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
monica Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
rachel Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every... little... thing!!
chandler So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
monica A couple of days.
chandler Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
monica What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
chandler Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
phoebe Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
monica Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
chandler No you can't.
phoebe Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
chandler You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
phoebe Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
chandler Okay.
phoebe I'm sorry.
joey Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
the_ad Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
joey Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
the_ad Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with - 
joey Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
the_ad You.
joey Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
the_ad You?
joey No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
the_ad What?
joey Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
the_ad There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
joey Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
the_ad The one with "Heston" on it.
joey Interesting.
monica Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
chandler No thanks, Mom!
phoebe Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
phoebe Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
monica Very good, so good.
phoebe I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
rachel Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
phoebe Come on! Look where you are!!
monica When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
phoebe Remember, a virgin for me please.
monica Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
chandler Ahh, come on! Y'know what - y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
phoebe Well, if you think it will help.
chandler No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
phoebe You should! How is she?
chandler Ohhh!!
monica I think somebody needs another lap dance.
charlton_heston Hello! Who's in there?
joey How ya doin'?
charlton_heston Who in the hell are you?
joey I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
charlton_heston Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
joey No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
charlton_heston You're in this picture?
joey Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
charlton_heston Joey, right?
joey Yeah.
charlton_heston Every actor at one time or another - opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
joey Oh no-no-no, you don't understand
charlton_heston Listen to me!
joey Oh yeah, yeah.
charlton_heston I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
joey Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm - 
charlton_heston Wait a minute! Take your pants.
joey Yeah. Oh, yeah.
monica So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
chandler Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
rachel I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
phoebe Who, Josh?
rachel It's Joshua.
monica What, he doesn't like Josh?
rachel No, I don't.
chandler All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
phoebe Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
chandler Yeah?
phoebe And do you know what girls are really good at?
chandler Stripping!
phoebe No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
rachel Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
monica Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
chandler Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
monica Come on! Chandler!
chandler Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
monica They really were pretty, weren't they?
phoebe Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
monica Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
phoebe Yeah.
monica Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
rachel See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
monica Oh, Chantal!
rachel Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh
chandler Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
monica Really?!
chandler I am totally picturing you with all those women!
monica That's-that's not Phase Three.
chandler Well, I'm there too!
rachel Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
chandler Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
phoebe Oh! What is that? What is that?
chandler Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
chandler Come on, let me see that smile.
joey I don't wanna.
chandler Please?
joey I wanted to go to the strip club!
chandler I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
joey Yeah, all right.
monica Hey!
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey - ooh so, how was Vermont?
ross Emily is... incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!

ross Happy for you.
rachel No, happy for you!
chandler All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
phoebe I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
chandler Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
monica Wait, now, what am I doing again?

the_cigarette_guy Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
rachel No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
