rachel Men just take out wind?
phoebe Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
rachel Wow.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like
monica It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
phoebe Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
monica No.
phoebe No, 'cause he's yummy.
monica Yes. But all the other ones.
phoebe Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
joey Anybody want a croan.
phoebe Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
estelle Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
joey So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
estelle Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
joey No, can we get back to me?
estelle Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for
joey Alright. Cab driver number two?
estelle You're welcome.
joey But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
estelle Things change, roll with em.
joey But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
estelle Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
joey I'm sorry. See ya.
rachel Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
monica Isn't it.
rachel Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
phoebe I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
ross Hey you guys.
monica Hey.
ross Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
rachel NO!
ross No?
rachel No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
ross Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
rachel No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
monica You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
ross Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
rachel Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
ross You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
rachel Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
phoebe Um-um, um-um.
rachel You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
joey What is it?
ross I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
joey See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
ross What, what's that?
joey It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
ross Open it, open in.
joey Oh my God.
ross Woah.
joey Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
ross Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
joey Ahh.
ross What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
joey My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
ross Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on
joey What?
ross That audition.
joey That's a two line part.
ross Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
joey So what.
ross So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
joey Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
ross Toilet paper?
joey Yeah.
ross Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
joey Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
ross I am your friend.
joey Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
ross But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
joey Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
ross Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
joey Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
ross Huh, I'm just saying...
joey Well don't just say.
ross Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
joey Ok.
ross Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.

chandler Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
eddie Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
chandler Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
eddie Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
chandler Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
eddie Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
chandler Your last roommate's kidney?
eddie That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
joey Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
