rachel_green What-what about Monica?
dr_ross_geller Oh, she isn't home.

dr_ross_geller Well, Ben would be there.

rachel_green Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
ben_geller What's a virgin?
rachel_green Water it is.
monica_geller What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
chandler_bing You mean the spitter?
monica_geller Come on! It wasn't that bad!
chandler_bing Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
monica_geller All right, what about the third guy?
chandler_bing You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
monica_geller Can you blame him?
chandler_bing Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
monica_geller Well then we still have a problem.
chandler_bing Yeah!
phoebe_buffay With what?
monica_geller Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
phoebe_buffay Oo! You should have one of us do it!
monica_geller Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
phoebe_buffay No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
monica_geller Are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
joey_tribbiani I call it!!
phoebe_buffay What?! No! It was my idea!
chandler_bing Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
joey_tribbiani Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
chandler_bing We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
rachel_green Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
ben_geller But you're not anymore!
rachel_green No, I'm not.
ben_geller 'Cause you guys were on a break.
rachel_green Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
ben_geller When's my daddy coming back?
rachel_green Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
ben_geller Sharing is good.
rachel_green Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
ben_geller Really? Like how?
rachel_green Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
ben_geller That's a good one.
rachel_green Yeah? You like that one?
ben_geller Yeah, you're funny.
rachel_green I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
ben_geller Can I do it to you?
rachel_green Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
joey_tribbiani So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
chandler_bing No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
monica_geller We're never gonna find anybody.
joey_tribbiani Well then let me do it!
chandler_bing Joe
joey_tribbiani No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
monica_geller Joey look it's really sweet
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
monica_geller That is true.
joey_tribbiani Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
chandler_bing Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
monica_geller It might be kinda cool.
joey_tribbiani So I can do it?
chandler_bing Yeah you can do it.
joey_tribbiani All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
monica_geller Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
monica_geller Here, take a couple of these.
phoebe_buffay What is it?
monica_geller It's Hexadrin.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
monica_geller Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
joey_tribbiani Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
rachel_green Coming.
dr_ross_geller I have a bone to pick with you.
rachel_green Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
rachel_green Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
dr_ross_geller That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
rachel_green Oh that.
dr_ross_geller Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
rachel_green Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
dr_ross_geller I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
rachel_green Yes.
phoebe_buffay It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
monica_geller Hexadrin.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
monica_geller No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
phoebe_buffay Say what?
monica_geller Y'know, the possible side affects.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
monica_geller Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
phoebe_buffay Why?
monica_geller In case it happens.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller You did it! You got ordained?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
chandler_bing Our minister
phoebe_buffay I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
monica_geller Phoebe, your liver is right here.
phoebe_buffay Okay, then I must be disoriented.
joey_tribbiani Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
chandler_bing Should we call the spitter?
carol_willick Hey Rachel!
rachel_green Hi!
carol_willick What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
rachel_green Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
carol_willick Can I ask what-Come on in.
rachel_green Okay.
carol_willick Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
rachel_green I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
ben_geller Gotcha!!
rachel_green I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
carol_willick Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
rachel_green Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
ben_geller Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
rachel_green Don't do that.
ben_geller Don't do that.
rachel_green Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
ben_geller Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
rachel_green Oh damnit!
ben_geller Oh damnit!
rachel_green No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
ben_geller Damnit!
rachel_green No don't! Go back to repeating!
ben_geller Damnit!
rachel_green Oh crap!
ben_geller Oh crap!
phoebe_buffay I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
monica_geller Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
phoebe_buffay Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
joey_tribbiani Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
chandler_bing Yeah. O-okay.
joey_tribbiani "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
monica_geller How about receiving?
joey_tribbiani Yes!
chandler_bing See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
joey_tribbiani Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
chandler_bing No, not us... Us!
monica_geller I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
phoebe_buffay Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
monica_geller It doesn't say that!
phoebe_buffay Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
chandler_bing See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
monica_geller There you go!
joey_tribbiani "...by doin' it."
chandler_bing Joe?
joey_tribbiani Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
chandler_bing Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!! I call that London style.
monica_geller No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
monica_geller And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much
joey_tribbiani Yeah baby!
chandler_bing And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
chandler_bing But then later that night
joey_tribbiani Yeah baby!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
chandler_bing Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
monica_geller Is Joey here?
chandler_bing Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
monica_geller Wouldn't you be?
chandler_bing Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
monica_geller Well, not anymore.
chandler_bing But we don't do that.
monica_geller I know, I just thought it would be fun.
chandler_bing How drunk are you?
monica_geller Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
chandler_bing That's the perfect amount!
monica_geller Okay!
monica_geller Y'know what's weird?
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller This doesn't feel weird!
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller You're a really good kisser.
chandler_bing Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
monica_geller Hm-hmm!
chandler_bing Okay!
monica_geller Wow! You are really fast!
chandler_bing It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica_geller We're gonna see each other naked.
chandler_bing Yep!
monica_geller Do you wanna do it at the same time?
chandler_bing Count of three?
monica_geller One!
chandler_bing Two!
monica_geller Two!
chandler_bing@monica_geller Three!
chandler_bing Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
monica_geller Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
chandler_bing Eh!
chandler_bing Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e
joey_tribbiani Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
chandler_bing No! No! No!
joey_tribbiani Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
chandler_bing They're in my bag over there.
joey_tribbiani Ah.
chandler_bing Uh, could you leave me one?
joey_tribbiani For just you?
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
chandler_bing No I-I-I'm fine.
joey_tribbiani All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
joey_tribbiani That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
monica_geller Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
joey_tribbiani Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay What?!
chandler_bing Who did you originally want to hook up with?
monica_geller Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
joey_tribbiani Yeah baby! No baby!
chandler_bing So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
monica_geller No because it-it didn't seem important.
chandler_bing Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
monica_geller Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
joey_tribbiani And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
chandler_bing I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
monica_geller Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
chandler_bing Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
joey_tribbiani What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
chandler_bing Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
monica_geller Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
chandler_bing It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
joey_tribbiani This is crazy.
phoebe_buffay I know! Robin is so gay!
rachel_green So now what have we agreed?
ben_geller No more pranks.
rachel_green And-and what else?
ben_geller That you and daddy were not on a break.
rachel_green Very good.
dr_ross_geller Rachel! What are you doing here?
rachel_green I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
dr_ross_geller Your good friend?
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller What's her last name?
rachel_green Carol...Lesbian?
dr_ross_geller Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
rachel_green What line?
dr_ross_geller Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
rachel_green All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
dr_ross_geller Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
carol_willick Hey Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
carol_willick What's not funny?
dr_ross_geller Practical jokes.
carol_willick Oh I...I think they're funny.
dr_ross_geller You have a line down your face.
carol_willick What?
rachel_green Okay, maybe they are not funny to you
carol_willick Oh my God!
rachel_green Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
dr_ross_geller Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
rachel_green That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
dr_ross_geller I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
rachel_green Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
dr_ross_geller No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
rachel_green Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
ben_geller Crap!!
rachel_green I gotta go!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
joey_tribbiani Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
chandler_bing Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
joey_tribbiani No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
chandler_bing How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
joey_tribbiani Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
chandler_bing That's what you should say.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
joey_tribbiani Really? I can do it?
chandler_bing I'd love it if you would do it.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing But those are the words! Those exact words!
joey_tribbiani Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so
rachel_green Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'll see you later pal.
rachel_green Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
dr_ross_geller What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!

dr_ross_geller All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!

chandler_bing Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
monica_geller Yeah baby!
phoebe_buffay I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
