rachel_green Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
phoebe_buffay Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
rachel_green No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
phoebe_buffay Okay!
rachel_green Sucker!
phoebe_buffay Hello? Hey Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
phoebe_buffay Sure! Where is it?
joey_tribbiani Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
phoebe_buffay Ohh! So you're 5639?!
joey_tribbiani That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
chandler_bing Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
joey_tribbiani No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
casino_boss Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
phoebe_buffay Who was that?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
chandler_bing Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
joey_tribbiani Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Don't come out here!
chandler_bing No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
joey_tribbiani I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
chandler_bing Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!

chandler_bing Uh, what was that?
joey_tribbiani Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
phoebe_buffay Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
monica_geller Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
phoebe_buffay It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
monica_geller Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
phoebe_buffay Which Richard?
monica_geller The Richard.
phoebe_buffay Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
monica_geller Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
phoebe_buffay Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
monica_geller It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
phoebe_buffay That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
monica_geller Really?
phoebe_buffay But again, Simmons. Go on.
monica_geller The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
monica_geller Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
monica_geller I know.
phoebe_buffay Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay On a totally different bet.
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller It's almost our anniversary!
chandler_bing I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
chandler_bing Huh.
monica_geller I got you a present!
chandler_bing Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
monica_geller I know, but you have to open it today!
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
chandler_bing Wow!
monica_geller For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
chandler_bing Do we have to?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
monica_geller Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
chandler_bing Yeah, I think we should see other people.
monica_geller But we can go, right?
chandler_bing Yes.
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing It's a great idea.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm gonna go too!
chandler_bing Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
phoebe_buffay Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
monica_geller Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
rachel_green Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
phoebe_buffay Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
rachel_green Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
dr_ross_geller Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
chandler_bing Art lover!
dr_ross_geller What'd you say?
chandler_bing I said art lover.
dr_ross_geller Is that supposed to be an insult?
chandler_bing I don't know, I'm very tired.
dr_ross_geller So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
rachel_green That sounds great.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
rachel_green Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
rachel_green No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
phoebe_buffay Naked alone time.
rachel_green No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
phoebe_buffay So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
chandler_bing So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
chandler_bing Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
phoebe_buffay Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
chandler_bing Happy plane-aversary.
monica_geller Aww! I love you!
chandler_bing Can I give you a present now?
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
monica_geller I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
chandler_bing How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
monica_geller Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
chandler_bing Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
phoebe_buffay Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
chandler_bing What-what Richard thing?
phoebe_buffay Oh no.
chandler_bing What Richard thing?
phoebe_buffay Simmons! Go with Simmons!
monica_geller Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
chandler_bing I'm not mad.
monica_geller Really?!
chandler_bing Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
monica_geller Great!
phoebe_buffay Okay, London 1
rachel_green Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
rachel_green Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller May I come in?
rachel_green Uh, yeah, if you want too.
dr_ross_geller Do you want me too?
rachel_green Yeah, sure?
dr_ross_geller So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
rachel_green And um, what-what is that Ross?
dr_ross_geller The physical act of love.
rachel_green What?! Are you crazy?
dr_ross_geller Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
rachel_green Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
dr_ross_geller You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
rachel_green Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
dr_ross_geller No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
rachel_green Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
dr_ross_geller Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
rachel_green Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
rachel_green Yes.
dr_ross_geller All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
rachel_green Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
monica_geller Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
phoebe_buffay For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
chandler_bing Oh my God.
phoebe_buffay Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
chandler_bing Love your condoms my man.
joey_tribbiani What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
phoebe_buffay Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
monica_geller Who are you talking too?
joey_tribbiani They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
chandler_bing Why?! What happened?!
joey_tribbiani Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
monica_geller I'm so sorry.
joey_tribbiani Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
chandler_bing No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
monica_geller I knew you were not okay with that.
phoebe_buffay So you're a gladiator! Wow!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, what-what's going on?
phoebe_buffay Monica had lunch with Richard.
joey_tribbiani Dawson?!
phoebe_buffay Noo! But that would've been so cool!
chandler_bing No! Her boyfriend Richard!
monica_geller It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
chandler_bing When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
monica_geller You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
chandler_bing Thanks.
joey_tribbiani Aww, there we go.
phoebe_buffay I love Vegas!
monica_geller I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
chandler_bing Next time?
joey_tribbiani Ooh, so close.
chandler_bing There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
monica_geller I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
chandler_bing That's so funny, because I think I just did!
monica_geller Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
chandler_bing Fine with me!
monica_geller Fine! Happy Anniversary!
joey_tribbiani Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
monica_geller No it is not!
chandler_bing What are you talking
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
rachel_green Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
dr_ross_geller Yep! That's hilarious!
rachel_green I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
rachel_green No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
rachel_green Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
dr_ross_geller What?! You totally get embarrassed!
rachel_green No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
dr_ross_geller Is that so?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
joey_tribbiani Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
chandler_bing Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
chandler_bing Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
joey_tribbiani All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
chandler_bing Whoa!
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
chandler_bing Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
chandler_bing Good luck!
joey_tribbiani Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
chandler_bing I see.
monica_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Thanks.
monica_geller I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
phoebe_buffay Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
monica_geller This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
phoebe_buffay So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
monica_geller Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
phoebe_buffay Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
monica_geller Anybody lose this?

chandler_bing What's an identical hand twin?
joey_tribbiani What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
chandler_bing Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
joey_tribbiani Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
chandler_bing How?
joey_tribbiani Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
chandler_bing Again I must go back to, how?
joey_tribbiani This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
chandler_bing Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
joey_tribbiani Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
chandler_bing No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!

chandler_bing No!
phoebe_buffay But she just came up here!
chandler_bing That was Joey!
phoebe_buffay I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
chandler_bing Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
phoebe_buffay Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
chandler_bing Really?
phoebe_buffay Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay Good. I should really start wearing hats!

dr_ross_geller Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
phoebe_buffay Ugh!
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
dr_ross_geller Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
phoebe_buffay M-M-Mole people?
dr_ross_geller What? No-no, a lurker.
phoebe_buffay Oh. What's a lurker?
dr_ross_geller Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then
phoebe_buffay Kills you?
dr_ross_geller No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh!
dr_ross_geller Uh-hmm.
phoebe_buffay How do you know about this?
dr_ross_geller My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
phoebe_buffay Dance karate?
dr_ross_geller Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
rachel_green All right, it won't come off!
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green It won't come off!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?

dr_ross_geller Your what?
joey_tribbiani My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
dr_ross_geller What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
joey_tribbiani Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
monica_geller All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!

chandler_bing Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
monica_geller Not any more.
chandler_bing Really?!
monica_geller Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
chandler_bing Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
customer Which guy?
joey_tribbiani He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?

joey_tribbiani Okay! How you doin'?
customer Very busy.
joey_tribbiani Right! Okay.
dr_ross_geller Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so.

dr_ross_geller Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
rachel_green Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
rachel_green Ross, I am a human doodle!!
dr_ross_geller Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
dr_ross_geller Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
rachel_green Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
