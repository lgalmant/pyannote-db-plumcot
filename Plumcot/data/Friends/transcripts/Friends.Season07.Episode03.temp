chandler Hey, you guys!
ross_and_rachel Hey!
chandler So, what do you think?
ross About what?
rachel Yeah, what?
joey What?
chandler Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
joey Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
chandler I got glasses!
ross Well, you-you've always had glasses.
chandler No I didn't!
ross Are you sure?
rachel Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm
joey Feminine.
rachel Yes!
chandler No!
monica Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
chandler Really?
monica Yeah!
chandler You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
monica Of course!
phoebe So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
chandler That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us
monica If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
rachel Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
monica Oh, I already have one.
phoebe Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
rachel Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
monica Hey, I know I what I want!
chandler What we want honey.
monica No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
phoebe You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
monica Uh-huh, yeah.
phoebe You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
chandler Dying people say the craziest things.
monica I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
phoebe Break my heart-Oh, all right.
monica Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
chandler Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
joey Ahoy!
chandler Hey! How's the boat?!
joey Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
monica Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
joey Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
phoebe If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
joey Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
chandler Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
rachel Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
joey You could?
rachel Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
phoebe Your own boat?
rachel What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
chandler Do you know what I was thinkin'?
monica What?
chandler Nothing, I just like to go like this.
ross Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
chandler Uh why, do you have a lecture?
ross No, why?
chandler Then free as a bird. What's up?
ross My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
monica Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
ross Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
chandler Well, did-did you correct him?
ross No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
monica This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
ross Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
monica Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
ross Yeah.
monica He hates to lose.
chandler Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
ross You're not a lefty?
chandler Does anybody know me?!
monica What's wrong Phoebe?
phoebe I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
monica No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
phoebe Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
ross Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
chandler Don't worry about it Pheebs.
ross No one got me an engagement present.
phoebe Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
chandler An old cookie?
monica This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
phoebe See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
chandler We can't accept this.
phoebe Why not?
chandler 'Cause it's gross.
monica No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
phoebe Really?!
monica Yeah! I bet I can do it.
chandler Okay, we owe you a present.
ross Two! I've been engaged twice!
joey Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
rachel That is the Coast Guard.
joey What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
rachel Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
joey All right.
rachel Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
joey Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
rachel Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
joey Uh, boat rope.
rachel Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
joey Uhh, rub it?
rachel No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
joey I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh
rachel Time's up, now your dead.
joey And deaf!
rachel Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
joey Yes.
rachel Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
joey I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
monica All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
phoebe You do?
monica You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
phoebe That and arrogance.
joey Hey.
monica Hey! How was sailing?
joey I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
monica_and_phoebe No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
joey Women are mean!!!
phoebe I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
ross Hey.
monica Hey! How was it?
ross Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
chandler I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
ross And what did he ask you not to call him?
chandler Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
chandler Guys?
ross Over here.
mr_geller Have a seat son. Hey!!
monica Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
chandler I know.
monica You gave my father a lap dance!
chandler Why do they put so much steam in there?!
ross 'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
chandler Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
phoebe Come on, it's not that big a deal!
chandler Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
ross Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
monica Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
chandler I don't want him to tell this story for years.
ross Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
monica I wasn't escaping.
ross Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
monica I was trying to help out a squirrel.
ross You were trying to eat it!
chandler If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
monica Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
chandler All right, I'm off to see your dad.
ross Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
rachel Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
chandler Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
ross Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
rachel I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
ross Thank you!
joey Hey.
ross Hey.
rachel Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
joey Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
rachel Why not?
joey Because! You're mean on the boat!
rachel What? I was just trying to teach you.
joey Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
ross Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
rachel Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
ross You have to respect the sea!
rachel Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
joey Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
rachel Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
joey Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
rachel Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
joey Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
rachel All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
joey You won't boss me around anymore?
rachel I won't boss you around.
joey And you'll be nice?
rachel And, I'll be nice.
joey And you'll be topless?
rachel And-Joey!
joey Do you want me to learn?!
monica Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
ross Let's give it a shot.
monica Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
phoebe Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
monica No, just a Friday night.
ross Ohh, these are pretty good.
phoebe Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
ross Which one was that?
monica The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
ross Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
phoebe Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
ross Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
rachel Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
joey Ohh yeah.
rachel Right?
joey Nope.
rachel It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
joey I don't know why you just don't say left.
rachel Okay, go to the left. The left!
joey Huh?
rachel Just sit over there!!
joey Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
rachel No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
joey Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
rachel Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
joey Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
rachel Joey, come on! We just went over this!
joey Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
rachel No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
joey All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
rachel What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
joey Why not?!
rachel Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
joey Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
rachel Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
joey Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
rachel No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
joey Well, hey I did learn.
rachel Really?
joey Yeah! Come on.
rachel Awww
joey Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
rachel Left.
joey Damnit!
phoebe Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
ross Looking up?
phoebe Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
monica Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
ross Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
phoebe Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
ross That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
phoebe That's what you think.
monica Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
phoebe Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
monica What was her name?
phoebe Nesele Toulouse.
monica Nestle Tollhouse?!
phoebe Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
monica Phoebe, is this the recipe?
phoebe Yes!! Ohh.
monica I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
phoebe I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
chandler So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
mr_geller I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
chandler What did you do when they found out?
mr_geller They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
chandler So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
rachel Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
joey Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
rachel Ohh we're not sailing.
joey Just pull on it.
rachel All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
joey What else?
rachel Here you go.
joey Thank you.
rachel Oh wow!
joey What are you doing?
rachel Ohh, sorry.
joey What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
rachel Ohh whoops.
joey Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
