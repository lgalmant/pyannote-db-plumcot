the_photographer Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
monica_geller Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
joey_tribbiani What? What's going on?
dr_ross_geller Monica's pregnant!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
monica_geller Guys! I'm not pregnant.
joey_tribbiani Ah. Slow swimmers?
dr_ross_geller What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
monica_geller You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
dr_ross_geller No! I'll be right back.
the_photographer Now why don't we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
monica_geller Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
joey_tribbiani I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
monica_geller Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
the_photographer Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
monica_geller Because I'm not.
phoebe_buffay We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
chandler_bing What?! What are you talking about?
monica_geller What are you talking about?
phoebe_buffay Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
monica_geller Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
chandler_bing Who's the father?
monica_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay I can't say.
monica_geller Why?!
chandler_bing Why not?
phoebe_buffay I can't say because he's famous.
rachel_green Oh my God, who is it?!
monica_geller Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
phoebe_buffay Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
chandler_bing As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
phoebe_buffay What?! Well he never said that to me!
the_photographer Why don't we have Monica step away and we'll get Chandler and the bridemaids.
phoebe_buffay How about just the bridemaids?
chandler_bing Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
phoebe_buffay It is.
rachel_green For you.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
rachel_green Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
phoebe_buffay So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
rachel_green You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.
phoebe_buffay Sneaky.
rachel_green Oh yeah.
the_photographer Smile ladies.
rachel_green Oh! Oh by the way?
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm.
rachel_green James Brolin?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
rachel_green Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
phoebe_buffay Really?!
the_bandleader Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!
chandler_bing Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
monica_geller Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
chandler_bing No?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing I've been taking dancing lessons.
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
monica_geller Oh that is so sweet!
chandler_bing So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
monica_geller Yes.
monica_geller What's the matter?
chandler_bing I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
monica_geller Well, are you going to be able to do this?
chandler_bing Not well.
monica_geller Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
phoebe_buffay So, are you ready to talk about it?
rachel_green No.
phoebe_buffay Now?
rachel_green No!
phoebe_buffay Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
rachel_green Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Who's the father?!
rachel_green Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?
rachel_green Phoebe!!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
rachel_green Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
phoebe_buffay Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
monica_geller Oh sweet Lord.
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
monica_geller Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's older brother.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode01 Oh hi, I'm, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
dr_ross_geller Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
mona You think so? I've always kinda hated it.
dr_ross_geller Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
mona Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller Mona umm...Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
mona Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
dr_ross_geller Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too.
mona Oh good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
dr_ross_geller Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
joey_tribbiani That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
nora_tyler_bing Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
dennis_phillips Congratulations.
chandler_bing Thank you.
nora_tyler_bing Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
chandler_bing Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
dennis_phillips Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.
nora_tyler_bing Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
joey_tribbiani I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
dennis_phillips Dennis Phillips
joey_tribbiani Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
dennis_phillips Oh, thank you. Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment.
joey_tribbiani Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
nora_tyler_bing Well, it's a funny story.
chandler_bing Funny: ha-ha or funny:
the_bandleader Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
mona No, nine.
dr_ross_geller Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm... Hello.
joey_tribbiani Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.
chandler_bing What size shoes do you wear?
joey_tribbiani Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
chandler_bing Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
joey_tribbiani Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.
chandler_bing Those aren't eleven and a half.
joey_tribbiani Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
monica_geller Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
rachel_green Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
monica_geller This is so huge.
rachel_green Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
monica_geller Of course not nothing is. Between me and you
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller ...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
rachel_green Hey! Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
monica_geller How?
rachel_green I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
monica_geller Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
rachel_green Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
monica_geller Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
rachel_green Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
monica_geller Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
rachel_green I don't know.
monica_geller Are you okay?
rachel_green Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
waiter#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode01 Champagne?
rachel_green Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
phoebe_buffay Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin
monica_geller Oh really?!
phoebe_buffay Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said
monica_geller Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
phoebe_buffay What?! Why bother?
monica_geller How do you feel?
rachel_green I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!!
phoebe_buffay Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
monica_geller Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
rachel_green How many ways are there to do that?
phoebe_buffay I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
rachel_green All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
monica_geller You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
rachel_green Okay. Thank you.
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay I'll run out and get you one.
rachel_green Oh, you guys are so great.
monica_geller Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
phoebe_buffay Oh no, she won't tell us.
monica_geller Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
rachel_green Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
phoebe_buffay See? This is why you register.

joey_tribbiani Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
chandler_bing Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
joey_tribbiani No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
chandler_bing But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

mona Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
dr_ross_geller I am so gonna score.
the_second_girl What?
dr_ross_geller I like your bow.
joey_tribbiani I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!
the_bandleader Thank you.
dr_ross_geller That was very nice Ashley.
ashley#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode01 Can we do it again?

joey_tribbiani Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show
dennis_phillips Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.
joey_tribbiani Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.

chandler_bing Did it turn into sand?
monica_geller Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
chandler_bing No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
monica_geller Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go.
