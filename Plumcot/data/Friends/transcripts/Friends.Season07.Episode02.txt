joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
joey_tribbiani Who wants French toast?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'll have some!
joey_tribbiani Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
monica_geller Oww!
chandler_bing What's the matter honey?
monica_geller I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
phoebe_buffay It starts?
rachel_green Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing Already?!
rachel_green Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music
chandler_bing Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
rachel_green Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks
dr_ross_geller Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing What in God's name is that?!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
monica_geller This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
phoebe_buffay That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
dr_ross_geller And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at
phoebe_buffay Hey! Ross!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
phoebe_buffay I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
phoebe_buffay Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
dr_ross_geller Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
phoebe_buffay Nothing-Why?!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
dr_ross_geller Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
monica_geller All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
rachel_green Aw.
monica_geller A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
chandler_bing Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
joey_tribbiani Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
chandler_bing Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
joey_tribbiani Well, the duck
rachel_green What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
joey_tribbiani Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
chandler_bing Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
monica_geller Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
chandler_bing Centerpieces!
monica_geller Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
chandler_bing Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
monica_geller Oh my God! It's like one mind.
chandler_bing Uh-huh!
joey_tribbiani Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
rachel_green Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
joey_tribbiani Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
rachel_green What?!
joey_tribbiani All right, I'm gonna go!
rachel_green Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
joey_tribbiani I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
joey_tribbiani Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar?..wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
dr_ross_geller Uh, Phoebe
phoebe_buffay Oh Ross, hi.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Okay, let's talk outside.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
phoebe_buffay What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
dr_ross_geller And they knew about it?
phoebe_buffay Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
dr_ross_geller Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
dr_ross_geller The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
rachel_green Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
joey_tribbiani Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
rachel_green No.
joey_tribbiani Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
rachel_green Joey, did you my face cream?
joey_tribbiani Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
rachel_green Joey, where did you learn that word?
joey_tribbiani Where do you think, Zelda?
rachel_green You found my book?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah I did!
rachel_green Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
joey_tribbiani Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
rachel_green Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
joey_tribbiani You got porn!
dr_ross_geller Hello.
woman Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
dr_ross_geller Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
woman Ohh great.
dr_ross_geller Can I, can I help you with something?
woman Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
dr_ross_geller Yes I am.
woman Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
judy_geller So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
jack_geller I remember when we first got engaged.
chandler_bing Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
monica_geller Oh dad, really you don't need to
jack_geller Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
judy_geller You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
chandler_bing What a sweet story.
monica_geller Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
jack_geller What?! They wanted a scary story!
monica_geller Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
judy_geller You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
monica_geller What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
jack_geller We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
monica_geller I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
judy_geller We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
monica_geller You bought the beach house when I was 23!
jack_geller Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
judy_geller We really do feel bad about this though.
jack_geller We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
monica_geller What about when I started dating Chandler?
judy_geller Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
chandler_bing Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
monica_geller I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
judy_geller We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
jack_geller It seemed like such a simple idea.
judy_geller Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
jack_geller All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
dr_ross_geller Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
monica_geller I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
chandler_bing I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
rachel_green Well what happened at dinner?
monica_geller My parents spent the money for our wedding!
phoebe_buffay My God! What did you order?!
rachel_green Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
chandler_bing Honey, it's gonna be okay.
monica_geller No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
rachel_green No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
chandler_bing Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
rachel_green Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
phoebe_buffay Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
monica_geller How? I don't have any money.
chandler_bing Well, I have some.
monica_geller How much?
chandler_bing Well, close to
monica_geller Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
rachel_green Well what?! How-how much is it?!
monica_geller It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
rachel_green Ohh! Really?!
monica_geller How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
rachel_green Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
chandler_bing Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
monica_geller@rachel_green Ah, yeah!
chandler_bing Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
phoebe_buffay Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
monica_geller This is the most special day of our lives.
chandler_bing No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
monica_geller Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
chandler_bing Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
monica_geller You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
chandler_bing Yes, I am!
phoebe_buffay Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach.
rachel_green Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
rachel_green Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
rachel_green Well no, I don't smell anything.
joey_tribbiani Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
dr_ross_geller Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
rachel_green Nothing!
dr_ross_geller Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
rachel_green Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
dr_ross_geller So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
rachel_green Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
phoebe_buffay Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
dr_ross_geller Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
phoebe_buffay My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
dr_ross_geller I gave him an extremely professional massage!
phoebe_buffay He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
dr_ross_geller Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
phoebe_buffay Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
dr_ross_geller He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
joey_tribbiani Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
dr_ross_geller His daughter was hot.
joey_tribbiani Gotcha.
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
chandler_bing Ehh.
monica_geller Eh, you work for that.
chandler_bing Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
monica_geller You do?!
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
monica_geller Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
chandler_bing Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
monica_geller You thought about that?
chandler_bing Yeah.
monica_geller How many kids were we gonna have?
chandler_bing Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
monica_geller What else did you think about?
chandler_bing Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
monica_geller Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
chandler_bing Sure you do.
monica_geller No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
chandler_bing You sure?
monica_geller Uh-hmm.
chandler_bing I love you so much.
monica_geller I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, totally!
monica_geller Oh good.
joey_tribbiani Hello, Zelda.
rachel_green Who are you supposed to be?
joey_tribbiani The vicar!
rachel_green Do you even know what a vicar is?
joey_tribbiani Like a goalie, right?
rachel_green Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
joey_tribbiani All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
rachel_green All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
joey_tribbiani Huh?
rachel_green That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
joey_tribbiani I-I-I-I did?
rachel_green Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
joey_tribbiani This body?
rachel_green Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
rachel_green Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
joey_tribbiani I don't want to, I'm scared.
