joey_tribbiani I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
all@ Did not, she did not wink at you....
chandler_bing Huh.
dr_ross_geller I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
rachel_green Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
phoebe_buffay See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
rachel_green What song was that, Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
phoebe_buffay Hi Monica!
dr_ross_geller Hey Mon!
rachel_green Hey Mon!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, has she slept at all?
dr_ross_geller Nope.
rachel_green No, it's been three nights in a row.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
chandler_bing Morning.
joey_tribbiani Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
chandler_bing Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
janice Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
joey_tribbiani Good morning.
chandler_bing Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
janice Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
chandler_bing I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
janice I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
chandler_bing Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
joey_tribbiani Kiss her! Kiss her!
janice I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
joey_tribbiani B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
chandler_bing Nope, not this time.
joey_tribbiani Come on, quite yankin' me.
chandler_bing I'm not yanking you.
joey_tribbiani This is Janice.
chandler_bing Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
joey_tribbiani Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
chandler_bing I'm not breaking up with her!
monica_geller God, look what I found in the drain.
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
dr_ross_geller Getting it away from me would be job one.
monica_geller It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
phoebe_buffay Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
monica_geller God, what is wrong with me.
dr_ross_geller You need to get some sleep.
monica_geller I need to get some Richard.
rachel_green Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
monica_geller I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
phoebe_buffay Maybe, because you told him not to.
monica_geller What are you the memory woman?
joey_tribbiani Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
rachel_green Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
joey_tribbiani Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
rachel_green Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
joey_tribbiani There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
dr_ross_geller Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
rachel_green Honey, I was wondering....
dr_ross_geller Hmm?
rachel_green Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
dr_ross_geller Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
rachel_green Hmm.
dr_ross_geller I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
rachel_green You remember not having sex in high school, right?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Well honey, what about you?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green Come on you gotta have one!
dr_ross_geller Nope.
rachel_green Ross, you know what...
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green ..if you tell me, I might do it.
dr_ross_geller Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
rachel_green Oooh!
dr_ross_geller Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
rachel_green Really!
phoebe_buffay Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
rachel_green Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
rachel_green Really! That-that great huh?
phoebe_buffay No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi you guys!
dr_ross_geller Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
rachel_green Mon. Hi!
monica_geller Hi.
rachel_green Why aren't you at work?
monica_geller Oh, they-they sent me home.
rachel_green Why?
monica_geller Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
dr_ross_geller Okay.

rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller Guess what?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller They published my paper.
rachel_green Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
phoebe_buffay Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Wheel!
chandler_bing Of!
joey_tribbiani Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
chandler_bing You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
joey_tribbiani I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
chandler_bing No, Janice.
joey_tribbiani Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
chandler_bing You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
joey_tribbiani No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
chandler_bing Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
joey_tribbiani Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
chandler_bing Well, there you go.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
chandler_bing Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
joey_tribbiani Look, what do you want me to say?
chandler_bing I want you to say that you like her!
joey_tribbiani I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
chandler_bing Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
dr_ross_geller How could you have told her?
rachel_green Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
dr_ross_geller Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
rachel_green Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
dr_ross_geller Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
rachel_green Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
dr_ross_geller That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
rachel_green Were both of those Joey?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
rachel_green Not even with your best friend.
dr_ross_geller Noo!
rachel_green That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
dr_ross_geller Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
rachel_green Pretty much.
dr_ross_geller Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
rachel_green Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
dr_ross_geller I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
phoebe_buffay Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
monica_geller Richard's living room, drinking wine.
phoebe_buffay All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
monica_geller I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
phoebe_buffay Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
monica_geller All right, I'll try not to.
phoebe_buffay Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
monica_geller Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
phoebe_buffay All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
monica_geller I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
phoebe_buffay All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
monica_geller Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
janice So, I hear, you hate me!
joey_tribbiani I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
janice A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
joey_tribbiani And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
janice All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
joey_tribbiani But what does that gonna do...
janice For Chandler!
joey_tribbiani Okay. I'm in.
janice Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
joey_tribbiani Does it have to be a whole day?
janice Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
monica_geller So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
phoebe_buffay Monica, do you want us to take you home?
monica_geller Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
dr_ross_geller Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
chandler_bing Umm, yeah.
dr_ross_geller No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
chandler_bing Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
dr_ross_geller Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
chandler_bing We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
dr_ross_geller Nooo!
chandler_bing Yeah, okay.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
chandler_bing Yeah! All right! You go first.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, I'll go first.
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
chandler_bing Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
dr_ross_geller Yes!
chandler_bing I know!
dr_ross_geller Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
dr_ross_geller Hmph.
chandler_bing And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
dr_ross_geller With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
chandler_bing I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
dr_ross_geller Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
chandler_bing You said...
dr_ross_geller I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there!
janice We're baack!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing What are you guys doing together?
janice Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
chandler_bing Really.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
janice I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
chandler_bing You still can't stand her can you?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
chandler_bing Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
joey_tribbiani But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
chandler_bing Well, I guess that's something.
joey_tribbiani No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
chandler_bing Oh God!
joey_tribbiani Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
chandler_bing Really?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.

monica_geller Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
jack_geller Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
monica_geller I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
jack_geller Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
monica_geller What makes you think that I might not be okay?
jack_geller I saw Richard.
monica_geller Oh.
jack_geller So, how are you doing?
monica_geller I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
jack_geller You don't wanna know.
monica_geller No, I really, really do.
jack_geller Well, he's doing terrible!
monica_geller Really!
jack_geller Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
monica_geller You're not just saying that are you?
jack_geller No, the man is a mess.
monica_geller Was he crying?
jack_geller No.
monica_geller Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
jack_geller Maybe.
monica_geller I think so.
jack_geller Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
rachel_green Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
dr_ross_geller No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
judy_geller Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
dr_ross_geller I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
