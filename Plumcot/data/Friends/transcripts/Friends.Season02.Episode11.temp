ross Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
carol So how did everything go?
ross Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
carol Well, we've gotta go.
ross Ok.
carol Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
ross Oh, you and me?
carol Uh, no, Susan and me.
susan The other us.
ross Ok.
carol We're uh, we're getting married.
ross As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
carol Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
ross Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
carol Look I just thought that...
ross No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
susan Is your finger caught in that chair?
ross Mmm hmmm.
carol Want us to go?
ross Uh-huh.
ross This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
joey It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
monica Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
ross_chandler_joey Yes!
monica They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
ross Would it matter?
monica Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
joey Are you really not going?
ross I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
monica They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
ross If you wanna call that a reason.
chandler Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
monica Ross, I thought you were over this.
ross Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
joey Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
rachel Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
joey No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
chandler Whoa, she's pretty.
joey Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
rachel I'm sorry, what?
monica What?
joey It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
chandler Oh, ok.
joey There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
mrs_wallace Is she gonna be all right?
joey I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
chandler Nice!
rachel That's great!
ross Excellent!
chandler For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
ross That is so good! Do it again!
joey All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
chandler That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
ross No no, that's me.
chandler Oh, yeah.
ross Oh, hello.
phoebe Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
ross Is everything ok?
phoebe Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
ross Oh my god.
chandler That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
phoebe Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
monica Oh, honey.
phoebe Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
rachel What do you mean?
phoebe I think it went into me.
monica God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
chandler Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
rachel Ok, who ordered what?
ross Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
chandler Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
rachel Oh god.
joey I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
rachel I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
phoebe Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
joey Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
phoebe I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
mrs_green There she is.
rachel Mom!
mrs_green Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
rachel Pretty much.
mrs_green Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
rachel This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
mrs_green Oh hello, Ross.
ross Hi, Mrs. Green.
mrs_green So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
rachel Oh Mom!
mrs_green If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
chandler Believe me, sometimes that happens.
mrs_green This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
rachel Really?
mrs_green Yes.
phoebe I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
joey Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
phoebe I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
mrs_green Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
rachel Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
mrs_green You have some life here, sweetie.
rachel I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
mrs_green I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
rachel For...me.
mrs_green Well, not just for you.
rachel Well, what do you mean?
mrs_green I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
monica All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
rachel Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
monica Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
ross And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
rachel None.
joey They didn't fight a lot?
rachel No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
phoebe In my day, divorce was not an option.
joey Hey, look who's up.
rachel I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
monica Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
rachel Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
chandler You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
phoebe That's him.
chandler Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
mr_a Phoebe?
phoebe Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
mr_a Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
phoebe Um, do you wanna sit?
mr_a Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
phoebe I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
mr_a You're saying, my wife is in you?
phoebe Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
mr_a Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
phoebe Everything?
mr_a Everything.
phoebe Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
mr_a Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
phoebe I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
mr_a Worth a shot, huh?
mrs_green Look at this.
rachel These are from Halloween three years ago.
mrs_green Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
rachel No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
monica Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
rachel Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
monica Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
rachel Hey, Mon, you want some help?
monica If you want.
phoebe Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
rachel She's still with you?
phoebe Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
mrs_green This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
rachel God!
monica All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
mrs_green That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
rachel Oh! What's new in sex?
mrs_green The only man I've ever been with is your father.
monica I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
mrs_green I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
mrs_green No.
rachel You want me to talk you out of it?
mrs_green No.
rachel Then what? What do you want?
mrs_green I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
rachel Why on earth would I understand this?
mrs_green You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
rachel Oh.
monica All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
chandler Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
monica Joey, speed it up!
joey I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
phoebe Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
monica Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
phoebe Sir! No sir!
monica All right, you!
ross No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
monica All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
chandler Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
monica Hi.
carol How's it going?
monica It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
carol Fine, whatever.
ross What's the matter?
carol Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
ross What?
monica You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
ross Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
carol My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
ross Oh my god.
carol I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
ross It's ok. I'm sorry.
carol And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
ross I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
carol You do?
ross Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
carol Of course I do.
ross Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
carol You're right. Of course you're right.
monica So we're back on?
carol We're back on.
monica You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
joey It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
chandler Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
phoebe Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
carol Thank you.
ross Any time.
carol Ross.
minister You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
phoebe Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
monica Would you look at them?
ross Yeah, can't help but.
joey How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
phoebe I miss Rose.
chandler Oh, yeah?
phoebe I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
woman You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
phoebe Ok, that's so nice.
chandler I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
rachel Hey, Mom? Having fun?
mrs_green Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
rachel There's more alcohol, right?
susan How you doin'?
ross Ok.
susan You did a good thing today.
ross Yeah.
susan You wanna dance?
ross No, that's fine.
susan Come on. I'll let you lead.
ross Ok.
chandler All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
monica Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
ross Well, Mon, I was married.
phoebe Yeah, me, too, technically.
rachel I had a wedding.
monica All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
joey I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
chandler Isn't Ben in this?
all Oh, yeah!
