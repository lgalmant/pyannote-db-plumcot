rachel Phoebe?
phoebe Yeah?
rachel Look at that guy by the window, wow!
phoebe He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
rachel Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
phoebe Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
rachel Yeah.
phoebe This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
rachel Really?! So this has happened to you?
phoebe Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
rachel Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
phoebe Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
rachel Ah.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
phoebe Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
mona Hey! Hey!
ross Hi!
mona Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
ross Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
joey Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
ross Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
mona Oh yeah, probably at the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
joey I'm missin' picture time?!
phoebe Y'know she has a face Ross!
mona Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.
ross Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
mona Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
ross Together? Like-like to people?
mona Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
ross Okay.
mona Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
ross Uh sure, sure.
mona Bye guys.
phoebe Bye.
joey Congratulations! You just got married!
ross I know. Can you believe that?
phoebe Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
ross Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
joey Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
doug Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
chandler Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
monica Yes, hi.
doug Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
chandler I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
doug Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
monica No leg-chewing for us sir.
doug Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
monica I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
doug Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
monica Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
chandler No.
monica That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
chandler Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
mona Hi!
ross Hey!
mona Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
ross Huh. Wow, this is great.
mona Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
ross Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
mona How many did you want? I'm getting a hundred.
ross A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh...I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
mona Really? Why not?
ross Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
mona Oh y'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?
ross Yeah.
mona Where are we?
ross Huh.
mona Y'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
ross Hmm
mona I mean I love spending time with you, y'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?
ross Let's do the card!
mona What?
ross The card! I think we're there!
mona Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.
ross Really?! I mean, even with the card?
nurse Hi!
rachel Hi!
nurse Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
rachel Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers
dr_schiff Hi Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
rachel Yes, you are.
dr_schiff So, how's it going?
rachel Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
dr_schiff I'm a doctor.
rachel Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
dr_schiff Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
rachel Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
dr_schiff So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
rachel No. I'm very comfortable.
dr_schiff Any painful gas?
rachel No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
dr_schiff Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
rachel Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
dr_schiff I'm sorry, is there something going on here?
rachel Do you feel it too?
rachel Hi.
phoebe Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
rachel Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
phoebe Oh my God.
monica Why did you do that?
phoebe Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
monica Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
phoebe You wish.
monica Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
phoebe Oh yeah? Come and get it.
rachel Okay, even this is turning me on!
ross Hey!
rachel Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
ross Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
monica You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
ross Yeah, we're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
phoebe Ugh! Women!
ross I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
rachel Uh Ross? You asked me that.
ross Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
monica Like asking her to move in with you?
ross Smaller than that.
monica Making her a mixed tape?
ross Uh, bigger than that.
phoebe Give her a key to your apartment.
ross Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
monica All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
ross Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
phoebe No, we hate that.
monica That is a slap in the face.
ross Forget it. I-I-Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
rachel I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
doug Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
chandler Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
doug Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
chandler Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
doug Oh? Why not?
chandler It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
doug What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
chandler Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
doug So why can't the three of us go out together?
chandler Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
doug Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
chandler Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
doug Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
chandler Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
ross Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
mona Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
ross Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
mona Okay.
ross I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
mona I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
ross Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.
mona Okay
ross But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.
mona Really?!
ross Really.
mona You don't think this is too fast.
rachel You gave her a key to your apartment?!
ross Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
phoebe Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
ross Oh great, I live on the street.
phoebe Where?!
rachel Hey!
phoebe Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
roger Hey everybody.
monica Hi Roger.
phoebe So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Umm, he's here to have sex with you.
rachel What?
phoebe You're welcome.
rachel Phoebe no!
phoebe It's okay, he's a virgin.
monica Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
phoebe Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.
rachel No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
phoebe Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
doug Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
chandler Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
doug Bing-What's this?!
chandler It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
doug No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
chandler Oh no-no-no!
doug Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y'know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
ross Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
mona Hey Ross, what's going on? You changing the lock?
ross No. That guy is.
mona I don't understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
locksmith Good luck buddy.
mona Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
ross I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
mona What?
ross I love you!
mona Ohh! And I love spending time with you.
chandler Hi honey I'm home.
monica From the tequila factory?
chandler It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
monica Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
chandler Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
monica I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
chandler Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
rachel Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back.
joey Who was that?
rachel It's just the pizza place.
joey You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
rachel I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
joey Oh, what's wrong?
rachel Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
joey Then why did I ask?
rachel Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
joey Is that college talk for horny?
rachel Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so...hard...to find. So how was your day?
joey Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
rachel Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
joey Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
rachel Okay, good night!
joey Good night.
joey I can't do it!
rachel I didn't ask you to do it!
joey You're Rachel!
rachel You're Joey!
joey You're my friend!
rachel Right back at ya!
joey But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
rachel And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
joey I know!
joey Do you wanna do it?
rachel No!
joey All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
rachel That's the end of this conversation!
joey This conversation never happened!
rachel Never happened! Good night!
joey Good night!
joey Get back in there!
phoebe Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!
