ross Dude. You're married to my sister.
chandler You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
ross Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
chandler Are you asking permission to break the pact?
ross Yes please.
ross Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!

chandler I said it first, bro.
ross Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
chandler Look, if you did...
ross Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
chandler Totally. I had sex in High school...
ross Me too. I'm good at it.
chandler All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
ross You got it.
chandler All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
ross Those are the pacts!
chandler Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
ross Oh, oh... maybe not you!
chandler Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.

missy Sure, he was in your "band"?
ross It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
missy Sorry.
ross That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
missy Really?
ross Yeah, why?
missy Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
ross You did?
missy Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
ross AND ON MY TURF?
monica Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
rachel Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
monica Who is it?
man It's the police!
rachel Uh! The police!
phoebe Oh!
man That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
monica What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
roy_the_male_stripper Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
roy Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
monica Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
roy Goodbody!
monica ...If-you-say-so.
roy So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
phoebe Oh, God!
roy All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! Whaaaa... Here? All right.
phoebe Rachel?
rachel Yeah?
phoebe Are you kidding?
rachel All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
phoebe How old is your phonebook?
monica Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
phoebe Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
roy Are you talking about me?
monica Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
roy Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? Did someone call for the long arm of the law? I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
roy Whoa, whoa, whoa . She cringed!
phoebe This is how I look when I'm turned on!
roy You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
phoebe Shocking!
roy Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
phoebe Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
rachel No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
phoebe No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
roy Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
phoebe I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
roy Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
phoebe Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
roy I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man.
phoebe I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
roy Oh, you're mean!
monica Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
roy Damnit. OH! Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
donny Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.

ross You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
chandler Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
ross You broke the pact!
chandler Ross, that was 16 years ago!
ross That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
chandler I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
ross I didn't.
chandler Oh really?
ross No.
chandler Oh really!?

adrienne Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
ross Cool!
ross I didn't know you knew about that.
chandler Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song
ross Man... I... I'm sorry.
chandler Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
ross So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
chandler Hmm mmmhm..
ross We are even, right?
chandler Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
ross What did you do to my mom?
chandler Not her!
flashback_scene We cut back to the 80's party. Rachel and Monica are "dancing".]
rachel I am sooo drunk.
monica That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.

pizza_guy SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?

chandler Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
rachel Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
chandler Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
rachel Oh, what a line.
chandler So where are you applying to?
rachel Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
chandler I'm in college and I'm in a band.
rachel Yeah okay.
roy What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
phoebe You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
roy No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
rachel No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
roy I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
rachel So maybe something in an office.
phoebe Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
roy You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
phoebe There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
roy Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
phoebe Finish it!

chandler Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.

chandler You kissed her that night too?
monica Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
chandler Seriously, where did this happen?
ross Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
chandler Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
ross Mine.
chandler I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
ross No, she was definitely on my bed.
chandler Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
ross Well, then who was on my bed?
