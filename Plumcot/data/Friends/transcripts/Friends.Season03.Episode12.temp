rachel Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
chandler Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
rachel Tell him.
ross It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
chandler All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
ross Why?
chandler I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
ross Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
chandler Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
ross Hmm? Oh, yeah.
phoebe Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
chandler It must take you forever to find your keys.
rachel Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
phoebe Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
rachel No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
ross Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
rachel Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
ross Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
rachel Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
phoebe Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
rachel Oh.
chandler Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
ross What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
chandler Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
phoebe A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich√°. Why don't you get a magician?!
chandler Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
ross She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
chandler Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
joey Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
chandler I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
joey It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
ross Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
joey What?
ross Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
joey Who?
chandler I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
joey The what?
chandler The abridgment.

monica How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
joey You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
director Lovely, just lovely.
joey Really? Thanks.
director Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
joey Excellent, I'll be there.
director Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
joey Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
director Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
chandler ...three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
joey Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
phoebe Well, can you dance at all?
joey Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
chandler Oh no, no, no, no.
phoebe What, what is that?
joey Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
chandler All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
monica Hi!
phoebe Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
monica It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
joey Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
chandler Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
joey Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
monica Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
joey The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
chandler To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
monica Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
phoebe Oh yeah.
monica Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
joey Whoa, I'm not done.
monica All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
chandler Bye-bye.
phoebe Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
chandler What, what, what?!
phoebe What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
chandler You really think that is what he meant?
phoebe Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
joey Done.
mark Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
rachel Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
mark Wh-what's that?
ross It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
mark Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
rachel Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
man Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
rachel Yes.
man One, two, three...
quartet Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
the_bass_barber Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
quartet And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
the_bass_barber It's nice to have a boyfriend.
quartet Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
ross I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
rachel All right Ross!! I get it!!
ross I mean my God...
rachel You're hurt!
ross ..can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
rachel Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
ross I would never do that!
rachel Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
ross Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
joey Mark's a genius!
ross Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
chandler Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
ross What am I going to do?
chandler Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
ross I don't know you guys.
chandler All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
joey And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
chandler He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
woman Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
mark And wait, I've got something for you.
woman Mark!!
mark It's okay, Rachel knows.
woman Yeah, but even soo.
mark I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
rachel Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
mark Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
ross All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
mark What is going on?
ross What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
rachel Ross!
ross I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
director Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
joey So, does that mean the audition is off?
director Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
joey What?!
director Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
joey It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
director Have fun.
joey Bye.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey.
phoebe What are you wrapping?
monica Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
phoebe Yeah, it's a vase.
monica Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
phoebe Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
monica What do you mean?
phoebe Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
monica So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
julio What?
monica Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
julio Whoa, whoa, whoa.
monica You don't even know me...
julio Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
monica What?
julio The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
monica I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
julio No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
monica Oh yeah.
director All right, let's do it!
director No, no, no. What was that?
joey I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
director Well, people!
joey People, people, people.
director Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
rachel So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
chandler Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
rachel Right.
chandler And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
ross Hi.
rachel Hello.
chandler Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
ross I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
rachel A big idiot.
ross A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
rachel Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
ross Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
gunther Let it be me! Let it be me!
rachel Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
ross I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
chandler Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
rachel Where ya going?
ross Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
rachel Ohh, with who?
ross Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
rachel There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
ross Yeah.
rachel You have a play date with a stripper?!
chandler Man, I gotta get a kid.
ross Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
rachel Sure, is she married?
ross Ahh, no.
rachel Oh.
ross Are you jealous?
rachel Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
ross You are totally jealous.
rachel I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
ross Honey, I love you too.
rachel Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
ross What?
ross Huh.
rachel Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
chandler Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
man Is there a Julio here?
julio I am Julio.
man Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
