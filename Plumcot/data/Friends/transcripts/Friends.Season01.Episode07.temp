rachel Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
chandler Oh, great. This is just...
rachel Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
monica Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
rachel Wow, you guys, this is big.
monica Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
phoebe Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
phoebe Well, I never call me.
chandler Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
jill Hi Mom, it's Jill.
chandler She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
jill Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
chandler Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
jill I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
chandler Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
joey Hi everyone.
ross And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
joey Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
phoebe Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
rachel That had to hurt!
chandler Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
chandler There you go!
chandler You're definitely scaring here.
jill Would you like to call somebody?
chandler Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
monica Hello?
chandler Hey, it's me.
monica It's Chandler! Are you OK?
chandler Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
monica What?
chandler I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
monica I have no idea what you just said.
chandler Put Joey on the phone.
joey What's up man?
chandler I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
joey Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
chandler Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
rachel Alright, somebody.
monica OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
all Whoooaa!
ross That's my sister.
joey OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
monica Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
ross Pheebs, what about you?
phoebe Oh... Milwaukee.
rachel Um... Ross?
ross Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
all No way!
ross The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
phoebe Oh, Rachel.
rachel Oh come on, I already went.
monica You did not go!
all Come on.
rachel Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be..... oh, the foot of the bed.
ross Step back.
joey We have a winner!
rachel I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
ross Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
rachel There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
ross Come on.
rachel No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
ross And you didn't marry him because...?
rachel I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
ross Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
rachel Yeah right.
ross It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
rachel OK.
ross But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
rachel You don't.
ross Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
rachel Really?
ross Mmmm.
rachel You do?
ross I do.
rachel Oh Ross, you're so great.
joey It's never gonna happen.
ross What?
joey You and Rachel.
ross What? Why not?
joey Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
ross No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
joey Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
ross I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
joey Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
ross I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
joey Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
ross Shhhh!
rachel What are you shushing?
ross We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
rachel Ahhhh!
ross See?
rachel Huh.
jill Would you like some gum?
chandler Um, is it sugarless?
jill Sorry, it's not.
chandler Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
phoebe New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
ross OK, here goes.
joey Are you going to do it?
ross I'm going to do it.
joey Do you want any help?
ross You come out there, you're a dead man.
joey Good luck, man.
ross Thanks. OK.
joey OK.
joey Hey, where are you going?
monica Outside.
joey You can't go out there.
monica Why not?
joey Because of... the reason.
monica And that would be?
joey I, um, can't tell you.
monica Joey, what's going on?
joey OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
monica About what?
joey He's planning your birthday party.
monica Oh my God! I love him!
joey You'd better act surprised.
phoebe About what?
monica My surprise party!
phoebe What surprise party?
monica Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
phoebe Well, he didn't tell me.
joey Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
phoebe This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
monica No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
phoebe Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
rachel Hmmm... this is so nice.
ross OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
rachel OK.
ross OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
rachel Ohhh!!!!
ross Yes, yes, that's right...
rachel Oh, look at the little cat!
ross What? Ow!
monica_joey_and_phoebe I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
monica This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
joey Sorry, that was wax.
phoebe Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
ross Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
rachel During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
ross Yeah?
chandler You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
phoebe Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
rachel Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
mr_heckles Er, yeah, it's mine.
phoebe He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
mr_heckles Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
phoebe Wait a minute. What's his name?
mr_heckles Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
rachel Bob Buttons?
mr_heckles Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
phoebe Oooh! You are a very bad man!
mr_heckles You owe me a cat.
rachel Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
rachel Wow.
ross Lucky sixes....
rachel Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
monica Hi!
rachel And Joey....
monica Hi!
rachel And Ross.
monica Hi!
rachel He doesn't speak much English.
paolo Monopoly!
rachel Look at that!
ross So, um... where did Paolo come from?
rachel Oh... Italy, I think.
ross No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
rachel Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
ross That, that is funny...... and Rachel keeps touching him.
phoebe Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
rachel Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
phoebe Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
rachel Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
phoebe You betcha!
chandler Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
chandler Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
chandler Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
jill Are you alright?
jill My God, you're choking! That better?
chandler Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
jill Perfection?
ross Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
ross Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
rachel I have absolutely no idea.
ross That's... that's classic.
rachel Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
monica If you want, I'll do it.
phoebe I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
rachel God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
phoebe You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard..... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
rachel Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
ross Paolo. Hi.
paolo Ross!
ross Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
paolo Thing?
ross Thing, yes. Thing.
paolo Ah, you... have the sex?
ross No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
paolo Bed?
ross No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
paolo Oh!
ross Yeah! Se vice?
paolo Si.
ross So you do know a little English.
paolo Poco... a leetle.
ross Do you know the word crapweasel?
paolo No.
ross That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
jill Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
chandler OK.
jill Ready?
jill No, you've got to whip it.
phoebe Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7..... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
ross Thank you.
phoebe Thanks.
ross Kinda... spooky without any lights.
joey Bwah-hah-hah!
ross OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
ross Oh.. oh... oh.
joey Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
jill Well, this has been fun.
chandler Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
jill Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
chandler Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
