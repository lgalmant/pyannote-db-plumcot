charlie_wheeler Oh! That feels sooo good!
rachel_green Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
charlie_wheeler I'm sorry, what?
rachel_green Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
charlie_wheeler From... Cosmo??
rachel_green Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
charlie_wheeler So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
joey_tribbiani So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
rachel_green Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
joey_tribbiani Oh hey Rach!
rachel_green Yeah...
joey_tribbiani Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
rachel_green Oh, well...
charlie_wheeler I'm sure you have better things to do.
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
charlie_wheeler If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
rachel_green Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
joey_tribbiani Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes..... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
phoebe_buffay Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?
joey_tribbiani What's the matter, Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
rachel_green Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
phoebe_buffay Exactly!
rachel_green And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
phoebe_buffay I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!
rachel_green Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
phoebe_buffay Ok, that'll be great!
joey_tribbiani Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
rachel_green That's not what we're gonna do!
joey_tribbiani Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
chandler_bing Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
monica_geller Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
chandler_bing Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
dr_connelly Hi there.
chandler_bing Hi.
monica_geller Hi.
dr_connelly I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
monica_geller Ok.
dr_connelly Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
chandler_bing Oh, DAMN IT!
monica_geller Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
dr_connelly Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
monica_geller Ok.
dr_connelly And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
chandler_bing Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
rachel_green Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
charlie_wheeler Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
joey_tribbiani Alright, have a good time.
rachel_green Not gonna find any clothes in there!
dr_ross_geller Hey, you guys!
rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
charlie_wheeler Umh... Kurts Baley?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing?
joey_tribbiani Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
charlie_wheeler So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
dr_ross_geller Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
charlie_wheeler He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
rachel_green Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
dr_ross_geller Tsz... NO!
chandler_bing Hey guys!
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
chandler_bing I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
dr_ross_geller It's in Barbados.
chandler_bing But you come first!
rachel_green I'm there!
charlie_wheeler We'll see you, guys!
joey_tribbiani Bye.
rachel_green Bye, see ya.
chandler_bing Ok.
joey_tribbiani All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
chandler_bing Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
dr_ross_geller So-so what did the doctor say?
chandler_bing Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
joey_tribbiani So you're ruling out surrogacy?
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani So, I don't have to learn what that means?
chandler_bing Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
joey_tribbiani Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
chandler_bing ah-ha!
dr_ross_geller How do you feel about all this?
chandler_bing I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
joey_tribbiani Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
dr_ross_geller What?
dr_ross_geller What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
dr_ross_geller The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
professor_sherman Mmm-mm.
dr_ross_geller I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's not what you want...
shop_assistant#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode22 Incentive For Men?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'll take some of that.
rachel_green Pheebs, that's for men!
phoebe_buffay No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
charlie_wheeler So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
rachel_green On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
charlie_wheeler See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
rachel_green Really?
charlie_wheeler Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
rachel_green Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
charlie_wheeler You've seen all the movies...
rachel_green Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
rachel_green Sure!
phoebe_buffay Ok!
charlie_wheeler Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
rachel_green You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
phoebe_buffay So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
rachel_green She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
phoebe_buffay Why?
rachel_green I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
phoebe_buffay Who else?
rachel_green Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
phoebe_buffay You like Joey?
rachel_green Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
rachel_green It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
phoebe_buffay Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
rachel_green Oh, I get it!
phoebe_buffay Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
rachel_green I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green So can we keep this between us?
phoebe_buffay Sure!
rachel_green Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
phoebe_buffay Oh.
phoebe_buffay Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
monica_geller Hi honey!
chandler_bing Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
monica_geller Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
zack You too.
chandler_bing You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
monica_geller I got it.
zack Thanks.
chandler_bing So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
monica_geller Yeah, I guess.
chandler_bing So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
monica_geller Excuse me?
chandler_bing Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
monica_geller Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
chandler_bing No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
monica_geller I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
chandler_bing Ok!
monica_geller Uh!
chandler_bing Zack!
zack Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
monica_geller Tell me about yourself, Zack!
rachel_green Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
rachel_green Ok, great!
rachel_green Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
phoebe_buffay I didn't say anything yet!
rachel_green Well, get back in there and talk!
phoebe_buffay I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
rachel_green What!?
phoebe_buffay Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
rachel_green Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! We have a problem.
rachel_green Oh! What are we gonna do?
stranger#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode22 Just be honest with her.
rachel_green Oh my God!
stranger#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode22 And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
rachel_green Alright! Enough out of you!
joey_tribbiani Hello?
dr_ross_geller Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
joey_tribbiani No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
dr_ross_geller I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
joey_tribbiani Oh! How's it going?
dr_ross_geller It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
joey_tribbiani What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
dr_ross_geller Barbados.
joey_tribbiani Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
dr_ross_geller What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
joey_tribbiani Well, just wake him up!
dr_ross_geller I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
joey_tribbiani Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
monica_geller Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
zack Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks!
chandler_bing So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
monica_geller Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
chandler_bing You don't like him.
monica_geller I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
chandler_bing Alright! Just follow my lead!
zack You guys have such a great place here.
chandler_bing Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
zack Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
chandler_bing That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
zack Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
monica_geller Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
zack No...
monica_geller Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
zack You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
monica_geller We're just making conversation.
zack Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
chandler_bing You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness
zack Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
chandler_bing@monica_geller Sure! Alright...
zack Ravioli's delicious!
chandler_bing I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
zack No I didn't.
monica_geller Yess!!
chandler_bing We're teeth people Zack!
rachel_green Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
phoebe_buffay Good plan.
rachel_green Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
phoebe_buffay Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
rachel_green Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
charlie_wheeler Oh! trying on clothes.
rachel_green Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
charlie_wheeler Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
rachel_green Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
charlie_wheeler No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
rachel_green Yeah.
charlie_wheeler It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
rachel_green Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
charlie_wheeler Wow!
rachel_green Yeah...
charlie_wheeler You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
rachel_green I try...
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!
professor_sherman You're welcome.
joey_tribbiani Wow! You look..... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
phoebe_buffay Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
joey_tribbiani Then don't go!
phoebe_buffay Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
joey_tribbiani Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
phoebe_buffay You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
phoebe_buffay David?
david Phoebe! Hi!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
david Wow, you look unbelievable.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
david Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
phoebe_buffay What happened?
david Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
david Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
phoebe_buffay Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
david Good, good, life is good...
phoebe_buffay Good!
david Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
phoebe_buffay Oh, good for you.
david She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
phoebe_buffay Mike and I broke up.
david You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
phoebe_buffay Really?
david Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
phoebe_buffay I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
david Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
phoebe_buffay Well... no.
david Do you wanna get a drink?
phoebe_buffay I'd love to.
david Great.
phoebe_buffay Ok.
david Do you smell beets?
phoebe_buffay Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
charlie_wheeler Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
rachel_green No, that's David.
charlie_wheeler There's a third guy?
rachel_green Tip of the iceberg.
zack I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
chandler_bing You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
zack No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
chandler_bing Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
zack No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
chandler_bing Ok.
chandler_bing I think we've found our sperm!
monica_geller Does seem pretty perfect.
chandler_bing Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
monica_geller No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
chandler_bing Yeah, he's better!
monica_geller No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
chandler_bing Really? Are you sure?
monica_geller Yeah, I'm sure.
chandler_bing Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
monica_geller That is so sweet. I love you.
chandler_bing So you know this leaves us with...
monica_geller Adoption.
chandler_bing How do you feel about that?
monica_geller I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
chandler_bing Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
monica_geller So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
chandler_bing Yeah.
monica_geller Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
chandler_bing We are gonna be great parents.
monica_geller And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
chandler_bing Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
chandler_bing Hey, Zack!
zack Hey Chandler.
chandler_bing Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
zack No you didn't.
chandler_bing Really?
zack No you did.
chandler_bing My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
jeanette Here are the boards for Friday's pitch
zack Oh, thank you.
chandler_bing You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
