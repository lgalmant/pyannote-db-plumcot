joey_tribbiani Morning, roomie!
rachel_green Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
joey_tribbiani Fifth day's a charm.
rachel_green Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
dr_ross_geller Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
rachel_green Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
joey_tribbiani She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
rachel_green Bye!
dr_ross_geller Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
joey_tribbiani No, hey, it's been great.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that'll do it.
joey_tribbiani Wow! So, how are you?
dr_ross_geller I'm, I'm okay.
joey_tribbiani Really?
dr_ross_geller Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
joey_tribbiani Well, actually it...
dr_ross_geller No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
joey_tribbiani Wow, really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
joey_tribbiani Sure, I know lots of girls.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Any names come to mind?
joey_tribbiani Ooh, names?
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
phoebe_buffay What you got?
joey_tribbiani Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
phoebe_buffay Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
joey_tribbiani I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
joey_tribbiani Why are they doing this?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
joey_tribbiani You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
phoebe_buffay I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
joey_tribbiani I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
phoebe_buffay I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
joey_tribbiani Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
phoebe_buffay You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
phoebe_buffay So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
joey_tribbiani I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, that's a great plan!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."
joey_tribbiani Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
chandler_bing See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
rachel_green I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
monica_geller Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
rachel_green Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
monica_geller Oh my god.
chandler_bing Wow.
rachel_green Why? What's the big deal?
monica_geller Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
rachel_green What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
chandler_bing Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
monica_geller You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
rachel_green So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
monica_geller Oh, it's perfect.
rachel_green Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
chandler_bing Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
joey_tribbiani All right! Who is he?
phoebe_buffay Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
joey_tribbiani Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah.
joey_tribbiani She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
phoebe_buffay A teacher?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
phoebe_buffay Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
joey_tribbiani Oh my god, you're right!
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
joey_tribbiani She even reads for pleasure!
phoebe_buffay How do you even know a woman like that?
joey_tribbiani What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
phoebe_buffay Joey.
joey_tribbiani I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
phoebe_buffay So now what do we do?
joey_tribbiani Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
phoebe_buffay What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
joey_tribbiani Ooh...I hear that's bad.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
joey_tribbiani Ah, yes, The Plan!
phoebe_buffay It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
phoebe_buffay No, I think we killed it.
chandler_bing Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
chandler_bing No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
monica_geller Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
chandler_bing I don't do that.
chandler_bing I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
monica_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Today is the sixth.
monica_geller No, it's not.
chandler_bing Yes, it's also 2003.
monica_geller Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
chandler_bing It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Tough crib.
monica_geller Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
chandler_bing I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
dr_ross_geller Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
the_waiter Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
dr_ross_geller Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
the_waiter Can I get you another glass of wine?
dr_ross_geller Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
the_waiter Got stood up, huh?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
the_waiter Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
dr_ross_geller No!
monica_geller We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
chandler_bing Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
monica_geller So, let's do this.
chandler_bing I - I don't think I can.
monica_geller Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
chandler_bing Because of Emma.
monica_geller Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
chandler_bing Sorry.
monica_geller Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
chandler_bing Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
monica_geller Canoodling?
chandler_bing Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
monica_geller I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
chandler_bing Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
monica_geller I guess you're right.
chandler_bing You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
monica_geller But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
rachel_green Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
steve I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
rachel_green Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
steve I'm kind of funny looking.
rachel_green What?
steve Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
rachel_green So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
steve I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
rachel_green Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
steve I lost it. To drugs.
steve I silk-screen t-shirts now.
rachel_green Really? What's that like?
steve It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
rachel_green Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
steve I do like my hair.
rachel_green Really?
phoebe_buffay Hello?
rachel_green Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Rach!
rachel_green This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
phoebe_buffay You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
rachel_green I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
phoebe_buffay Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
rachel_green He's not stoned.
phoebe_buffay Did he go out for a cigarette?
rachel_green Yeah, four times.
phoebe_buffay My dear, sweet Rach.
phoebe_buffay Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
joey_tribbiani Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
phoebe_buffay By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
monica_geller She's asleep. Chandler?
monica_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing Emma was doing it!
monica_geller She's asleep.
chandler_bing Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
monica_geller Yes, but we have to be fast.
chandler_bing Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
monica_geller Okay, I'll try.
joey_tribbiani Hello?
joey_tribbiani Emma? Hey! Hi!
joey_tribbiani How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
joey_tribbiani You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
the_waiter I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
dr_ross_geller Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
the_waiter Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
dr_ross_geller Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
the_waiter Ooh...
dr_ross_geller Just the crab cakes.
waiter_2 What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
the_waiter Just get out of here, okay?
dr_ross_geller What's - what's going on?
the_waiter Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
dr_ross_geller What? You - you're making money off my misery?
the_waiter Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
dr_ross_geller This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
monica_geller Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
chandler_bing I think we may have really done it this time.
monica_geller Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
chandler_bing You may wanna get some more of those too.
chandler_bing Where's Emma?
monica_geller Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
chandler_bing Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
monica_geller Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
steve I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.
rachel_green No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
steve Really?
rachel_green Don't touch my coat!
rachel_green Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
monica_geller Hey, Rach, how's it going?
rachel_green Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
rachel_green Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
monica_geller Hey, did you stop by here?
rachel_green No.
monica_geller Oh my god, then...
monica_geller Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
rachel_green What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
monica_geller Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
monica_geller Why the hell did you take her?
joey_tribbiani Because you two were having sex!
monica_geller No, we weren't!
joey_tribbiani Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
chandler_bing All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
joey_tribbiani Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
chandler_bing No, no, no.
monica_geller No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
joey_tribbiani Hey, I gotta! Unless...
monica_geller Unless what?
joey_tribbiani Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
chandler_bing What? Why?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
chandler_bing Your family name is Tribbiani.
joey_tribbiani You almost had me.
rachel_green Well, uh...
steve Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?
rachel_green Really, really not.
steve Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
rachel_green All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
dr_ross_geller Hey, what's wrong?
rachel_green I just had a rough night.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Crab cake?
rachel_green Eww!
dr_ross_geller Well, what happened?
rachel_green Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
dr_ross_geller Monica told me you had a blind date.
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller I did, too.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
rachel_green Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
dr_ross_geller Why does everyone keep saying that?
rachel_green Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
dr_ross_geller That bad?
rachel_green Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
dr_ross_geller Female body inspector? What size is that?
phoebe_buffay Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
joey_tribbiani It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
phoebe_buffay Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
phoebe_buffay Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
dr_ross_geller The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
rachel_green Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
joey_tribbiani We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
phoebe_buffay Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
joey_tribbiani Where?
phoebe_buffay Mexico!
joey_tribbiani Can you believe they're still not here?
dr_ross_geller I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
joey_tribbiani I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
the_waiter What?
joey_tribbiani We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
the_waiter Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
steve I have such fat hands!
