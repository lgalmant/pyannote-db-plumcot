rachel_green Ross kissed me.
monica_geller Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
rachel_green It was unbelievable!
monica_geller Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
phoebe_buffay Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
rachel_green Oh, it ended very well.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
monica_geller Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
phoebe_buffay Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
rachel_green Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
phoebe_buffay Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
rachel_green No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Ohhhh.
dr_ross_geller And, uh, and then I kissed her.
joey_tribbiani Tongue?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Cool.
chandler_bing All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
phoebe_buffay Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
chandler_bing Games and stuff.
monica_geller There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
joey_tribbiani Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
monica_geller There's an ad for a naked chef?
joey_tribbiani No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
dr_ross_geller Hi.
phoebe_buffay Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
dr_ross_geller That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
monica_geller Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
joey_tribbiani You got all that from saline solution?
monica_geller We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and..... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
rachel_green Hey, you.
dr_ross_geller How are you?
rachel_green Good. How are you?
dr_ross_geller Good.
julie Hi, honey.
dr_ross_geller Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
julie Good.
dr_ross_geller Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, actually.
dr_ross_geller Play it.
phoebe_buffay Ok, all right.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
julie What?
dr_ross_geller Ssshh.
phoebe_buffay Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
phoebe_buffay There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
mr_rastatter This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
monica_geller So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
mr_rastatter Mockolate.
monica_geller I'm sorry?
mr_rastatter Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
monica_geller Ohh.
mr_rastatter Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
monica_geller All right. Mmm-mmm.
mr_rastatter Yeah?
monica_geller I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
mr_rastatter No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
monica_geller Mmm-mmm.
mr_rastatter But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
monica_geller Wow.
mr_rastatter Aren't you going to swallow that?
monica_geller Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
mr_rastatter Yeah, isn't that great?
monica_geller Mmm.
mr_rastatter Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
monica_geller Abso......lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
mr_rastatter Really?
monica_geller Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
monica_geller How about Mockolate mousse?
phoebe_buffay It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
monica_geller Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
phoebe_buffay What makes it pilgrim?
monica_geller We'll put buckles on it.
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Did uh, Ross call?
monica_geller No, I'm sorry.
rachel_green Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
phoebe_buffay No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
dr_ross_geller I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
chandler_bing Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
joey_tribbiani Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
chandler_bing Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
joey_tribbiani Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
chandler_bing Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
dr_ross_geller Can't we just use a pen?
chandler_bing No, Amish boy.
joey_tribbiani Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
dr_ross_geller I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
joey_tribbiani You could say that.
dr_ross_geller And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
chandler_bing Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
dr_ross_geller I don't know.
joey_tribbiani Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
chandler_bing Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
dr_ross_geller She's not Rachel.
monica_geller Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
rachel_green Oh my god.
monica_geller Oh my god good?
rachel_green Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
phoebe_buffay Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
chandler_bing I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
joey_tribbiani Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
dr_ross_geller Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
chandler_bing So, Spock actually hugs his father?
rachel_green Hey, do you guys have......hi.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Where you goin'?
dr_ross_geller I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
rachel_green Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
dr_ross_geller Well, uh.
joey_tribbiani He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller Really. It's always been you, Rach.
rachel_green Oh, god.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Ohhh.
rachel_green Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
dr_ross_geller I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
rachel_green Let me get my coat.
dr_ross_geller Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
rachel_green Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
chandler_bing What? Nothing.
rachel_green What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
chandler_bing No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
rachel_green Well what is it? Let me see.
dr_ross_geller Hey, someone order a coat?
rachel_green Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
dr_ross_geller He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
chandler_bing Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
rachel_green And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani No!
rachel_green Come on.
joey_tribbiani Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
chandler_bing Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
dr_ross_geller That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
rachel_green All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
dr_ross_geller No, you don't.
rachel_green All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
rachel_green What is this? Ross, what is this?
chandler_bing Good luck.
dr_ross_geller Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
rachel_green Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
dr_ross_geller Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
rachel_green Just a waitress?
dr_ross_geller No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
rachel_green Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
dr_ross_geller No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
rachel_green She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
dr_ross_geller No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
chandler_bing My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
monica_geller You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
phoebe_buffay I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
joey_tribbiani Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
phoebe_buffay What?
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
monica_geller This was your idea?
phoebe_buffay What were you thinking?
chandler_bing All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
monica_geller Yeah. You!
chandler_bing All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
dr_ross_geller Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
rachel_green When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
dr_ross_geller I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
rachel_green Not interested.
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
dr_ross_geller Number six: the way you smell.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
dr_ross_geller Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, I do.
chandler_bing What are you doing out there?
dr_ross_geller I am, uh, I am...
monica_geller Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
dr_ross_geller Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
rachel_green No.
dr_ross_geller No?
rachel_green That's what I said.
chandler_bing Look, maybe we should go?
rachel_green No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
dr_ross_geller Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
rachel_green No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
dr_ross_geller No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
rachel_green Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
dr_ross_geller You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
rachel_green Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
joey_tribbiani I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
monica_geller Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
mr_rastatter Doesn't matter.
monica_geller What?
mr_rastatter Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
monica_geller Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
mr_rastatter Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
monica_geller Well, uh, I ate some.
mr_rastatter Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
monica_geller Hello?
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
monica_geller Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
dr_ross_geller Look, can, can you do something for me?
monica_geller Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
radio#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode08 The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
radio#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode08 Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
mr_rastatter Hi, thanks for coming in again.
monica_geller Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
mr_rastatter It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
monica_geller Cat hair.
mr_rastatter Oh, sorry.
