rachel You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
joey Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
rachel I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
joey No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
monica Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
rachel Of course, I'd be honored!
chandler Thanks!
monica Thank you!
joey U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
chandler Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
monica Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
joey Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
monica Clearly we were wrong.
joey I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
monica You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
joey Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
chandler So excited about your letter!
phoebe Hey!
all Hey Phoebe!
joey Hey!
monica Wow! Don't you look nice?!
phoebe Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
rachel OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
phoebe YEAH!
chandler So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
phoebe Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
joey Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
phoebe Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
monica You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
chandler That's where people make number two!!
charlie Hey!
ross Hey...
charlie So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
ross Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
charlie Fine, it's fine... I'll just shower by myself...
ross B, B, B, B, B!
charlie Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
ross Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
ross Damnit!
amy Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! I have to talk to you!!
ross Hi Amy!
amy You're not Rachel.
ross Still sharp as a tack!
amy Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
charlie Hi!
amy Hi!
charlie Nice to meet you.
amy H-Hi!! And you are...?
ross Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
amy N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
ross Yes, yes, you did.
ross Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
rachel Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
amy Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
joey That's right, yeah.
amy You're not good!
joey Always nice to meet a fan!
rachel So now, what are you doing here?
amy Well, I have huge news.
rachel Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
amy Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
ross Ehm... Her name is Emma.
amy Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
ross What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
amy Hey, your English is getting better!!
ross Oh my God!
joey I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
ross What... what you working on?
joey Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
ross Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
joey What did I just say?
ross Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
joey Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
rachel God!
amy So beautiful.
rachel Oh, I know, isn't she?
amy No, I was talking about your bedding.
rachel All right. What's your news, Amy?
amy Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
rachel What? Oh my God! To who?
amy This guy! He has a killer apartment.
rachel A-And??
amy A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
rachel No, what's he like?
amy Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
rachel Yeah.
amy It's his dad.
rachel Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
amy Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
rachel Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
amy Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
rachel Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
amy Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
rachel Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
amy You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!
rachel Ok.
amy I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
rachel Ok, let's keep talking.
phoebe Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they're in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! Can't believe it's been a whole year!
mike I know. This has been the best year... THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
phoebe ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
mike I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
phoebe YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
announcer Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
phoebe Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.
mike Really?
phoebe Oh, it's the worst way to propose!
mike Excuse me...
joey Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
chandler I don't... uh... understand.
joey Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
monica It doesn't make any sense.
joey Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
chandler On every word?
joey Yep!
monica Alright, what was this sentence originally?
joey Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
chandler And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
joey Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
monica Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
joey Why not?
monica Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
chandler You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
rachel Amy, hi!
amy I took your advice, I left Myron.
rachel Oh, good for you!
amy I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
rachel Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
amy Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
rachel But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
joey Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
amy Well, I'm staying with you guys!
joey What?
amy We're gonna be roomies! Come on!
joey You slept out here?
rachel Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'
joey But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
rachel Joey, I can't do that!
joey Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
rachel Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
joey 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
rachel No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
joey Yeah, Monica made us!
rachel Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
amy Good morning.
joey Yeaah.
rachel Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
amy Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
rachel Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
amy Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
joey I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
phoebe Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
chandler I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
monica Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
ross Seriously?
chandler Word!
phoebe Well, mine was worse than that.
rachel Well, what happened?
phoebe We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
rachel Oh, that is so tacky.
phoebe Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
monica Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
rachel Phoebe, that's huge!
ross Well, do you wanna marry him?
phoebe Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
chandler She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
monica Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
phoebe Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
monica I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
chandler Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
monica Thank you.
phoebe Well, do you think I should propose?
rachel I think it could be kind of great!
ross Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
phoebe Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
monica How about at a game, on the big screen?
rachel Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
monica What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
phoebe Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
chandler Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
amy Nana is on the phone
rachel Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
amy She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
rachel Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
ross No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
rachel Menstrual cramps.
ross I don't think that's what this is.
rachel Can any of you watch Emma?
monica No, sorry sweety..
phoebe No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
rachel Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
amy Well, I can do it.
rachel Well, actually...
ross Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
rachel Yeah.
ross Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
rachel Why not?
ross Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella! Rachel: Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
ross Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
rachel Wha... the next one?
ross Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
rachel Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
ross I... I don't know..
rachel Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
amy um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me...
rachel Absolutely.
amy Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
chandler Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
joey Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
monica You dropped it off?
joey Yeah.
chandler Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
joey No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
monica You hand-wrote it?
joey Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
monica Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
chandler It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
monica Okay good.
chandler Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye.
monica Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
chandler They loved it.
monica What?
chandler They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
monica They thought Joey was a child?
chandler She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
amy Hi!
monica Hey, what did you guys do today?
amy Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
chandler That sounds like fun.
amy Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
rachel Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
amy I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
rachel Yeah!
amy Ta-daaa!
rachel You pierced her ears!?
amy Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
rachel You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
amy Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
chandler I think she looks cute.. but I am wrong!
rachel Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
amy Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
rachel Ugh.
ross Hey guys. Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
ross Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.
rachel Nah, I don't really want her to see.
ross Why not?
monica Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
chandler Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
ross Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
ross What?
rachel Nothing.
ross Hi! What... Please tell me those are clip-ons.
rachel Oh, they're real!
ross Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
rachel I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
amy Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
monica I'm a cool, fun aunt!
amy O-Okay!
chandler Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
rachel I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
amy Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
rachel Oh yeah? Since when?
amy Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
rachel What?
ross That's not a thing!
amy Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
rachel Babies don't care if they're slim.
amy Enter Amy!
ross Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
amy What? What are you gonna do?
ross No more falafel for you!
mike Great game, huh?
phoebe Uhuh, uhuh...
mike Why do you keep looking at the screen?
phoebe I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
mike Going go to the bathroom.
phoebe Well, I think you should wait.
mike Why?
phoebe Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
announcer Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
phoebe Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
announcer Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
phoebe That's not very enlightened!
phoebe Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
joey Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
rachel Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
joey Whoo-hoo!
amy You're kicking me out?
rachel You put holes in my baby's ears!
amy Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
rachel I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
amy You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
rachel Excuse me?
amy You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?
rachel Joey, where are those bags?
joey She has a lot of crap!
amy You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
rachel Seriously?
amy hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
rachel Hips or thighs?
amy Ass and face.
rachel Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
amy She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
rachel Oh, I can give you that.
amy You can?
rachel Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
amy Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
rachel Did you just say Emma?
amy Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
phoebe That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
mike But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
phoebe I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
phoebe It's in the cake, isn't it?
mike Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
phoebe What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
mike No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
mike I'm gonna do this now.
phoebe Oh my God!
mike Phoebe, I...
phoebe Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
mike Ready?
phoebe Uh-huh!
mike Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
phoebe Yes!
mike I love you!
phoebe I love you more!
mike Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
rachel So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
amy Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
rachel That's shocking!
amy Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! Hello-oo Ross! He's rude!
