phoe No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
joey Maybe he's. . . gay.
phoe Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.

mich Alright.
rach OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
phoe So, I figured it out.

rach Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
mich Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."

And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
