_joey Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
monica 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
rachel Ok honey, you really need a job.
ross Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
monica Really.
_phoebe Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
ross On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
_phoebe No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
everyone Ahh.
phoebe And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
monica His indian name?
phoebe No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
ross Freakish.
monica Wow.
joey Freaky.
monica Weird, weird.
_rachel Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
phoebe Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
monica Why?
phoebe Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
_chandler Man, I am so beat.
ross Oh yeah.
chandler Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
ross Yeah alright.
_big_bully Hey you're in our seats.
ross Oh, sorry we didn't know.
little_bully Hey, we were sitting there.
chandler Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
_little_bully Is that supposed to be funny?
chandler No actually, I was just going for colorful.
big_bully What's with this guy?
little_bully What's with you?
ross Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
chandler What just happened?
little_bully I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
chandler That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
little_bully No.
chandler No?
big_bully No.
ross Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
big_bully Why should we?
chandler Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
big_bully You got a problem with that?
chandler No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
rachel Hey, how'd the interview go?
monica It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter.
rachel So don't do it.
monica How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
_joey Monica, relax, go get a beer.
monica I don't want a beer.

_joey Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
chandler Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
monica Hey, I went up.
rachel What?
monica My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
joey Do what?
monica Put all my money in me.
rachel Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
_monica What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
joey See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?

chandler Hey.
ross What?
_chandler Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
ross Do you say this stuff to girls?
big_bully Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
little_bully And look where they're sitting.
ross You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
big_bully Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
little_bully Yeah.
_big_bully This couch belongs to us.
chandler Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
big_bully You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
_ross Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
gunther Fellas, these guys were here first.
big_bully Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
little_bully Sorry.
gunther There you go.
ross Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
_little_bully He told on us?
big_bully You told on us?
ross Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
chandler Don't play with his things.
ross I know.
_big_bully Alright, let's take this outside.
ross Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
big_bully The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
chandler You had to ask.
ross Yeah.
_ross Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
little_bully Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
chandler I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
joey Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
phoebe Yeah, I don't know.
rachel What's the matter?
phoebe I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
rachel Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
joey Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
phoebe Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
_phoebe What was that?
joey Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
monica I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and
rachel Time is money my friend?
joey Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
_monica Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
joey Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
rachel How did you make $17.
monica Well, my financially challenged friends,
joey How come those?
monica Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
rachel What happened to uh, MEG.?
_monica MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
joey That is so not my motto.
phoebe Hey.
rachel Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
phoebe Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
joey Good.
rachel Oh, thank God.
_phoebe Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
rachel Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
phoebe I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone.
joey Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
phoebe Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
rachel She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
joey It's a woman.
phoebe So talk to her.
_joey Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
rachel Why the voice.
joey Hard to say.
chandler Your cappucino sir.
ross Thank you.
chandler Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
ross Absolutely.
_ross How come it's not mixing with the water?
chandler Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
joey Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
chandler Ok.
ross No.
chandler No?
_ross No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
chandler Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
joey Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
ross Yeah, sure.
joey By someone besides Monica?
_ross No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
chandler Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
monica I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
rachel What?
monica Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
rachel For what?
monica I've gotta get back in the game.
rachel Why, when did you get out of the game?
monica I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
rachel Oh no.
monica Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
rachel Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
monica Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
rachel I, I don't have it.
_monica But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
rachel Nobody does honey.
phoebe Hi.
_mrs_buffay Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
phoebe It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
mrs_buffay What are these, stitches?
phoebe Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
mrs_buffay Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
phoebe Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
mrs_buffay How do you know Frank?
phoebe Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
mrs_buffay Yeah. Frank.
frank Yeah. What?
_phoebe Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
mrs_buffay He went out for groceries.
phoebe Ok so will he be back soon?
mrs_buffay Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
phoebe Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
frank Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
phoebe Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
frank Heavy.
phoebe Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
frank No but he didn't really talk about anything.
phoebe Oh.
frank Except stilts.
phoebe Stilts?
frank Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
phoebe Wow.
frank Yeah.
phoebe I don't know what to do with that.
_frank Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
phoebe Yeah.
frank This is huge, you can buy me beer.
phoebe I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
frank I gotta friend named Mark.
phoebe That'll work too.
frank Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
phoebe Yeah, that'd be ok.
frank Alright.
phoebe Ok, I'm in the book.
frank Ok, yeah.
phoebe Alright. So um, stilts huh?
frank Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
phoebe Ok.
_ross Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
chandler Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
chandler Ah, there we go.
ross I think we proved our point.
chandler You burn your mouth?
ross Cannot feel my tounge.
_chandler Bullies, big bullies.
little_bully Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
big_bully Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.

little_bully It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
chandler Alright, let's do this.
little_bully Alright.
chandler Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
ross Whad'ya mean?
chandler Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
big_bully No, you can't use your watch.
chandler Ok.
big_bully Or your keys.
chandler Ok.
little_bully Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.

big_bully Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
ross Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
little_bully Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
big_bully Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
little_bully Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
big_bully Yeah.
chandler Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
_big_bully C'MON!
