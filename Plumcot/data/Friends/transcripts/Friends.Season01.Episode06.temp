rachel Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
chandler You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
phoebe The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
ross Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
joey Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
rachel God. I feel violated.
monica Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
chandler Ross, ten o'clock.
ross Is it? Feels like two.
chandler No, ten o'clock.
ross What?
chandler There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
ross Oh. Hel-lo!
chandler She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
monica Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
chandler Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
rachel Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
chandler Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
ross He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
chandler Thank you, buddy.
phoebe Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
monica You could do that!
chandler Y'think?
all Yeah!
chandler Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
ross C'mon! C'mon!
chandler Here goes.
aurora ..Yes?
chandler Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.
aurora Yes, you said that.
chandler Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
aurora Chandler?
all Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
joey Whadja think?
all ..Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
joey C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
all Saw your head. Saw your head.
chandler She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
rachel What is it?
joey The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
phoebe Based on this play?..Based on this play!
chandler Hey, kids.
all Hey.
phoebe No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
chandler Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
monica Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
chandler It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
aurora ..Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I-..I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
chandler Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
chandler We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
aurora ..All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
chandler Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
aurora 'We' would be me and Rick.
joey Who's Rick?
chandler Who's Rick?
aurora My husband.
all Ooooohhh.
chandler Oh, so you're divorced?
aurora No.
chandler Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
aurora No, I'm still married.
chandler So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
aurora Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
chandler Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
aurora Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
all What?!
chandler So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
aurora I suppose mainly sexual.
chandler ..Hm.
monica Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
chandler What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
monica Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
chandler Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
phoebe Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
ross No, of course not!.Yeah, yeah, it is.
monica What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
joey I couldn't do it.
monica Good for you, Joey.
joey When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
ross Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
ross Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
monica We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
all Yeah! C'mon!
ross Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
rachel Tah-daaah!
chandler Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
rachel Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
ross Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
rachel Well, whaddya think?
all Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
monica ..Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
all Uh-oh...
monica How-how did that happen?
rachel I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
monica Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
phoebe I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
chandler Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
monica You guys, I am not that bad!
phoebe Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
monica That is so unfair!
ross Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
monica Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
ross Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
monica Why not?
ross Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
monica I could do that.
rachel Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
monica Why would someone do that?!..One might wonder.
chandler Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
monica STOP IT!!..Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
ross Monica? You're Mom.
phoebe Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
joey Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
all Oh my God! Whoah!
monica Well, what's the part?
joey Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
phoebe Seriously, what-what's the part?
joey "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
ross C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
joey ..I'm his
rachel .You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
joey ..I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
monica Oh my God.
joey C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
chandler Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
joey Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
ross You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
monica Alright, alright, alright...
joey Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
monica For what?
joey Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
monica Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
joey Thank you!
chandler Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
monica He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
chandler C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
monica I warned you...
rachel Who is being loud?
chandler Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
monica Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
chandler Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
rachel Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
chandler No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
monica Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
director ..Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
joey Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
director Lose the robe.
joey Me?
director That would work.
joey Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
director Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working. and... action.
director And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
joey Well, I'm- I'm showering.
director No, that was clenching.
joey Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
director I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
joey I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
chandler God, I love these fingers...
aurora Thank you.
chandler No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
aurora Oh my God, I'm late.
chandler Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
aurora Okay.
chandler Don't go.
aurora Okay. Oh no, I have to.
chandler Too bad, she's leaving.
aurora I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
chandler Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
aurora It's not Rick.
chandler What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
aurora No, it's-it's Andrew.
chandler I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
aurora He's... new.
chandler Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
aurora No, that's not exactly what I was..
chandler Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
aurora So what do you want?
chandler You.
aurora You have me!
chandler Nono, just you.
aurora Whaddyou mean?
chandler Lose the other guys.
aurora ..Like,..all of them?
chandler C'mon, we're great together, why not?
aurora Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
chandler ..Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
aurora So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
chandler I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
aurora Which one?
chandler ..The second guy.
aurora Well, call me if you change your mind.
chandler Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
ross Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
all Hey!
monica Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
joey Nope.
ross No? What happened, big guy?
chandler "Big guy?"
ross It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
joey I got fired.
all Oh!
joey Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
rachel Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
joey My mom will.
chandler Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
joey Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
monica Maybe this wasn't your shot.
ross Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
joey Hard to tell, I was naked.
phoebe No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
joey Yeah? That's so nice!
monica I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
all Night.
rachel Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
monica Uh-huh!
rachel Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
monica Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
ross She is a kook.
monica If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back!..I need help!
