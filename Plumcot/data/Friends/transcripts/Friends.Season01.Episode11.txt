phoebe_buffay Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
monica_geller Why?
phoebe_buffay Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
monica_geller Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
phoebe_buffay Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
monica_geller He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode11 Nice hat.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Thanks.
phoebe_buffay We should do something. Whistle.
monica_geller We are not going to whistle.
phoebe_buffay Come on, do it.
monica_geller No!
phoebe_buffay Do it!
monica_geller No!
phoebe_buffay Do it do it do it!
monica_geller Woo-woo!
phoebe_buffay I can't believe you did that!
monica_geller Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
phoebe_buffay I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
monica_geller Phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Maybe nobody's tried this.
monica_geller I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
monica_geller Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
phoebe_buffay Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
monica_geller I wish all guys could be like him.
phoebe_buffay I know.
chandler_bing Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
monica_geller He doesn't have anyone.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
rachel_green Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
jay_leno Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
chandler_bing Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
rachel_green No way, forget it.
joey_tribbiani C'mon, she's your mom!
chandler_bing Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
rachel_green Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
chandler_bing Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
dr_ross_geller C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
chandler_bing You can say that because she's not your mom.
dr_ross_geller Oh, please...
paolo Bona sera.
rachel_green Oh, hi sweetie.
dr_ross_geller When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
monica_geller Last night.
dr_ross_geller Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
phoebe_buffay Hey hey hey! She's on!
paolo Ah! Nora Bing!
jay_leno ..Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
phoebe_buffay Your mom was arrested?
chandler_bing Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
nora_tyler_bing ..This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
chandler_bing Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
all@ Shhh.
nora_tyler_bing ..I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
chandler_bing THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
jay_leno Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
nora_tyler_bing Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
all@ Awww!
chandler_bing This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
jay_leno Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
nora_tyler_bing Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
chandler_bing ..And then he burst into flames.
monica_geller Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
phoebe_buffay What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
monica_geller Nah... not-not special enough.
phoebe_buffay Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
monica_geller Waaay too special.
nora_tyler_bing I am famished. What do I want...
chandler_bing Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
nora_tyler_bing Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
chandler_bing Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
dr_ross_geller What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
nora_tyler_bing Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
chandler_bing I know I am.
nora_tyler_bing Who's doing shots?
monica_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay I'm in.
nora_tyler_bing There y'go. Ross?
dr_ross_geller Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
rachel_green Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
dr_ross_geller ..But a man can change.
dr_ross_geller Anyone want me to appraise anything?
rachel_green Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
nora_tyler_bing Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
chandler_bing Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
nora_tyler_bing Yeah, any messages for room 226?
nora_tyler_bing You okay there, slugger?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
nora_tyler_bing What is with you tonight?
dr_ross_geller Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
nora_tyler_bing Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
dr_ross_geller No. It's the one he's licking.
nora_tyler_bing She's supposed to be with you.
dr_ross_geller You're good.
nora_tyler_bing Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
dr_ross_geller The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
nora_tyler_bing No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
dr_ross_geller When?
nora_tyler_bing He's not a hero...You know who our hero is.
dr_ross_geller The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
nora_tyler_bing No, it's you!
dr_ross_geller Please.
nora_tyler_bing No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
dr_ross_geller Right.
nora_tyler_bing You are gonna be fine, believe me.
dr_ross_geller Uh-oh...
joey_tribbiani Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
dr_ross_geller Hey, is Chandler here?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
joey_tribbiani Right. No big deal.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
dr_ross_geller What code?
joey_tribbiani You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
chandler_bing What are you guys doing out here?
dr_ross_geller Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
dr_ross_geller No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
chandler_bing Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
joey_tribbiani Ross, how could you let this happen?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
joey_tribbiani You don't think my mom's sexy?
dr_ross_geller Well... not in the same way...
joey_tribbiani I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
dr_ross_geller Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green What're you guys doing out here?
dr_ross_geller Well, not playing raquetball!
joey_tribbiani He forgot to leave his grip size!
dr_ross_geller He didn't get the goggles!
rachel_green Well,sounds like you two have issues.
rachel_green Goodbye, baby.
paolo Ciao, bela.
dr_ross_geller Do they wait for me to do this?
joey_tribbiani So are you gonna tell him?
dr_ross_geller Why would I tell him?
joey_tribbiani How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
dr_ross_geller Oh...
monica_geller What are you guys doing here?
joey_tribbiani Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
monica_geller ..What did I ask?
monica_geller Hi.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
monica_geller What are you doing here?
phoebe_buffay Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
monica_geller I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
phoebe_buffay No. No! No!..So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
monica_geller How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
phoebe_buffay Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
chandler_bing Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
chandler_bing I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
chandler_bing What?
dr_ross_geller I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
chandler_bing You knew about this?
joey_tribbiani Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
chandler_bing I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
dr_ross_geller Thanks, man, big help.
chandler_bing I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
dr_ross_geller I wasn't- I mean, I-
chandler_bing Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
dr_ross_geller I know-
chandler_bing I can't believe you did this.
dr_ross_geller Chandler-
joey_tribbiani Me neither, y'know what-
chandler_bing I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
joey_tribbiani What are you mad at me for?!
dr_ross_geller Chandler-
chandler_bing You gotta let me slam the door!
joey_tribbiani Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
dr_ross_geller Joey-
joey_tribbiani Ah! Huh?
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
monica_geller 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
rachel_green Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
monica_geller Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach.
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hello.
monica_geller Hello.
phoebe_buffay Going to the hospital tonight?
monica_geller No, you?
phoebe_buffay No, you?
monica_geller You just asked me.
phoebe_buffay Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
rachel_green Okay. I am so hot!
joey_tribbiani Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
dr_ross_geller I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
joey_tribbiani C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
rachel_green Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe_buffay Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
rachel_green Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
chandler_bing What was that?
dr_ross_geller Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
chandler_bing Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
joey_tribbiani Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
dr_ross_geller Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
chandler_bing Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
dr_ross_geller Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
chandler_bing Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
dr_ross_geller We're rehearsing a Greek play.
chandler_bing That's very funny. We done now?
dr_ross_geller No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
chandler_bing That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
dr_ross_geller Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
phoebe_buffay Alright, whadyou do with him?
monica_geller Oh! You're awake!
phoebe_buffay Look at you! How, how do you feel?
coma_guy Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
monica_geller You look good!
coma_guy I feel good!..Who are you?
monica_geller Oh, sorry.
phoebe_buffay I'm Phoebe Buffay.
monica_geller I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
phoebe_buffay Well, we both have.
coma_guy So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
phoebe_buffay Well, actually it's just from me.
monica_geller I got you the foot massager.
phoebe_buffay You know who shaved you? That was me.
monica_geller I read to you.
phoebe_buffay I sang. Hah!
coma_guy Well,... thanks.
monica_geller Oh, my pleasure.
phoebe_buffay You're welcome.
coma_guy So. I guess I'll see you around.
phoebe_buffay What, that's it?
monica_geller "See you around?"
coma_guy Well, what do you want me to say?
monica_geller Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
coma_guy Alright, I'll call you.
phoebe_buffay I don't think you mean that.
monica_geller This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
nora_tyler_bing Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
chandler_bing No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
nora_tyler_bing Alright, well, be good, I love you.
chandler_bing You kissed my best Ross!..Or something to that effect.
nora_tyler_bing O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
chandler_bing Really stupid.
nora_tyler_bing Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
chandler_bing Yeah. No. No...
dr_ross_geller Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
joey_tribbiani Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
dr_ross_geller You're kidding.
joey_tribbiani No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
dr_ross_geller Wow!
joey_tribbiani Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
dr_ross_geller 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
joey_tribbiani That makes more sense.
dr_ross_geller So, what's going on now?
joey_tribbiani I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
dr_ross_geller Whaddya see?
joey_tribbiani Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
nora_tyler_bing You okay, kiddo?
chandler_bing Yeah, okay.
nora_tyler_bing Alright.
chandler_bing Nice save.
dr_ross_geller Mrs. Bing.
nora_tyler_bing Mr. Geller.
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller You mean that?
chandler_bing Yeah, why not. So I told her.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? How'd it go?
chandler_bing Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
dr_ross_geller Well, howdya feel?
chandler_bing Pretty good! I told her.
dr_ross_geller Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
rachel_green Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
monica_geller What's a 'niffle'?
joey_tribbiani You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
rachel_green Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
dr_ross_geller Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
rachel_green Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
all@ Nooo!
