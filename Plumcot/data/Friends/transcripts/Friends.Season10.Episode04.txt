monica_geller Hey guys!
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Hey!
chandler_bing Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
monica_geller That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
rachel_green Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
rachel_green We're having a party.
monica_geller Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
chandler_bing Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
dr_ross_geller C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
monica_geller Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
chandler_bing There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
rachel_green Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
rachel_green And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
monica_geller All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
chandler_bing Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
monica_geller Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
rachel_green You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
phoebe_buffay Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
dr_ross_geller Hey guys!
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
rachel_green Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
phoebe_buffay Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
dr_ross_geller That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
rachel_green Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
dr_ross_geller Ah, and where is Joey?
rachel_green I said it's still nap time.
dr_ross_geller Hey, there is uncle Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
joey_tribbiani 18, uh? Ross: Joey, NO!
joey_tribbiani What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
dr_ross_geller When they see this you'll be 52!
joey_tribbiani And starting to think about settling down!
rachel_green Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
joey_tribbiani I'd love to! Yeah! Joey: We were supposed to bring presents?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
phoebe_buffay Joey, it's a birthday party.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! Yeah... that's a funny cup!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
rachel_green Oh, she's still napping
chandler_bing Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
rachel_green Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
monica_geller All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
rachel_green No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
monica_geller Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
jack_geller@judy_geller HI!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller So glad you came!
jack_geller I can't believe Emma is already one!
judy_geller I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! Ross: There's something you didn't know about your dad!
joey_tribbiani Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
jack_geller Thank you!
joey_tribbiani Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
jack_geller Which one are you?
monica_geller I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
chandler_bing I know, what are we gonna do?
monica_geller I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
chandler_bing I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents! Phoebe: So you're gonna... hit on her?
joey_tribbiani No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
phoebe_buffay Oh!
joey_tribbiani You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
phoebe_buffay Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
joey_tribbiani Hey, I think Emma might like it!
rachel_green Oh! Emma might like what?
joey_tribbiani Um, my present!
rachel_green What did you get her?
joey_tribbiani Actually we prepared performances.
phoebe_buffay Separate performances.
joey_tribbiani But equally real!
rachel_green Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
phoebe_buffay Sure, yeah!
joey_tribbiani O K.
rachel_green All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
dr_ross_geller Oh, great!
phoebe_buffay Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
rachel_green So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
joey_tribbiani I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
rachel_green Oh, ok, which one?
joey_tribbiani Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, "Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression" eesh! "Love you forever". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be". And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".
rachel_green Wow! That was amazing!
dr_ross_geller Thank you so much for that gift!
chandler_bing I was not ready for this today!
dr_ross_geller Amazing... amazing.
rachel_green Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
phoebe_buffay That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
rachel_green Is that it?
phoebe_buffay No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading "Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.
everybody#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode04 No, no, no, no, no!
judy_geller Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
jack_geller Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
judy_geller Yes, you'll be all grown up by then. We'll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.
jack_geller That's true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
judy_geller After all, my parents died very young.
jack_geller And my cholesterol's off the charts!
judy_geller Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
dr_ross_geller Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
rachel_green Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
dr_ross_geller Sure.
rachel_green Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
monica_geller Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
rachel_green Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
monica_geller Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
rachel_green Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
dr_ross_geller Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
rachel_green Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!
phoebe_buffay oh! Now it's a party!
rachel_green Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
joey_tribbiani Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
judy_geller Jack, look at this.
jack_geller I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
dr_ross_geller I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
rachel_green No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
dr_ross_geller Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. That is a weird sentence!
rachel_green Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
joey_tribbiani I'm so confused!
rachel_green Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
chandler_bing To be fair this one does have nuts.
dr_ross_geller Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
monica_geller Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
dr_ross_geller Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
chandler_bing Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
monica_geller We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
chandler_bing We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
monica_geller Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
phoebe_buffay And you know, I have a massage client soon.
dr_ross_geller You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
monica_geller Alright, 5 more minutes.
dr_ross_geller Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? Ok, I'll be right there.
chandler_bing Was that Emma? Is she up?
dr_ross_geller No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
phoebe_buffay Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
monica_geller No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
dr_ross_geller No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
chandler_bing I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
dr_ross_geller Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
joey_tribbiani Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
chandler_bing To the bathroom!
joey_tribbiani Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
phoebe_buffay Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
chandler_bing What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
joey_tribbiani Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
phoebe_buffay No, it did not.
joey_tribbiani No.
judy_geller Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
jack_geller Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
judy_geller Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
joey_tribbiani Ok!
judy_geller Bye... Bye dear.
joey_tribbiani Nighty-night!
judy_geller Nighty-night!
joey_tribbiani Bye, bye.
phoebe_buffay Joey? How could you just let them leave?
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
monica_geller No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
chandler_bing You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
joey_tribbiani Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
joey_tribbiani Hello?
estelle_leonard Joey! It's Estelle!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
estelle_leonard So, how did your audition go today?
joey_tribbiani What audition?
estelle_leonard The one I told you about last week?
joey_tribbiani What? You never said anything about an audition!
estelle_leonard Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
joey_tribbiani A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
phoebe_buffay Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
monica_geller Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
phoebe_buffay Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
monica_geller No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
joey_tribbiani Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
monica_geller Ok, ten.
joey_tribbiani Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
phoebe_buffay No, lets just draw straws.
joey_tribbiani Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
chandler_bing I'm begging you stop.
joey_tribbiani Right.
monica_geller Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!! Let's do that!
chandler_bing That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
monica_geller Everybody get your toys!
phoebe_buffay Ok! I want the dolphin!
chandler_bing Thats a bear.
phoebe_buffay I'm too excited!
monica_geller Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
joey_tribbiani Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
chandler_bing Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
phoebe_buffay Go! Go!
joey_tribbiani Come on robot!
monica_geller What are you barking at?
monica_geller Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
chandler_bing I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
joey_tribbiani Way to go robot!
phoebe_buffay Good job Alan!
joey_tribbiani Hey, good race you guys.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, see you later!
monica_geller No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
chandler_bing They left.
rachel_green No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...
dr_ross_geller RACHEL!
rachel_green OOH! God! Sorry!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
rachel_green Emma's awake.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
rachel_green I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
dr_ross_geller Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
rachel_green Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
dr_ross_geller Rach, she's not going to remember this.
rachel_green I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller It's not bad.
rachel_green Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
dr_ross_geller Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
rachel_green Well, I'm very impressed.
dr_ross_geller Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
monica_geller Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
monica_geller Game?
chandler_bing Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
chandler_bing Ooh! That's my girl!
monica_geller That's how old you are.
chandler_bing Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
monica_geller Ooh, I want one...
chandler_bing Me too...
chandler_bing There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
monica_geller ..and head to Canada!
chandler_bing I was kidding.
monica_geller I wasn't. Let's get going!
phoebe_buffay Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
chandler_bing No, not yet.
phoebe_buffay Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
monica_geller What about your massage client?
phoebe_buffay I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
joey_tribbiani Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
joey_tribbiani I've been here the whole time!
dr_ross_geller Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
rachel_green I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
chandler_bing Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
rachel_green What?
chandler_bing Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
emma_gellergreen Wo-ish.
rachel_green Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
rachel_green NO, no science camp!
dr_ross_geller Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
rachel_green Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
monica_geller Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
chandler_bing Let's do it, come on!
dr_ross_geller What's wrong? Are you okay?
rachel_green Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
phoebe_buffay Hey, you made it into a bunny.
joey_tribbiani What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay, you ready?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller A-a-and... record.
rachel_green Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
phoebe_buffay Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
