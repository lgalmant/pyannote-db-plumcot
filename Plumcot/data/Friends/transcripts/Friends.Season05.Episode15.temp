ross Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
chandler Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
monica What are you doing?!
chandler Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
monica Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
ross What the hell are doing?!!
rachel Hey, what's-what's going on?!
chandler Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
joey Dude! He's right there!
ross I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
chandler Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
monica I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
ross My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
rachel Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
ross What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
rachel Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
ross You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
joey Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
ross Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids
chandler Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
joey I call Godfather!
ross You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
joey Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
monica Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
chandler Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
rachel Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
phoebe Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
rachel Okay.
joey Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
katie Hi!
all Hi!
joey So, are you ready to go?
katie Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
joey Oh sure, right back there.
katie Hey, where are we going to lunch?
joey I was thinking Chinese food.
katie Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
rachel She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
joey I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
monica But what?
joey She keeps punching me.
monica In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
joey Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
monica I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
chandler Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
rachel Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
ross Aww.
phoebe Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
ross Huh.
phoebe Bread, so you never go hungry.
ross Ohh.
phoebe And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
ross Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
phoebe Yeah!
guy Hi!
ross Hi!
guy Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
ross Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
steve Oh hi Phoebe.
phoebe Mr. President.
steve I came to talk to you about Howard.
ross Howard?
steve Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
ross Oh that's nice.
steve Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or
ross Oh. Uhh
steve Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
ross No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
steve Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
ross Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
steve Oh, okay, I get it.
ross No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
steve Howard's the handy man!
ross Yes but too me he's just, man.
steve Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
ross Ugh, can you believe that guy!
phoebe Yeah. I really like his glasses.
ross ...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
chandler Sounds like a fun party.
rachel Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
ross It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
rachel Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
ross Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
rachel And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
chandler Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
rachel Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
chandler Wh-wh-why?!
rachel Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
chandler Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
rachel Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
chandler I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
rachel No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
chandler Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
rachel Not unless different means the same.
katie You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
joey Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
katie No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
joey Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
katie Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
monica Isn't this great?
chandler Hmm.
monica Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
chandler Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
monica Are you okay?
chandler Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
monica What-what are you doing?
chandler I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
monica Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
chandler What?!
monica Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
chandler Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
monica Oh and you know what I want!
chandler Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
monica I do not have baby fever!
chandler Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
monica Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
chandler Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
monica You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
chandler Well, I did not know that.
chandler It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
ross_and_joey Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
chandler By me?
ross Oh, no!
joey No-no.
ross Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
joey Yeah, big!
joey Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
monica Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
chandler Monica.
monica I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
chandler Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
monica What?!
chandler Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
monica Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
party_guests Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
ross Phoebe!
phoebe Oh, hi Ross!
ross What are you doing?
phoebe Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
guest_1 See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
ross You chipped in?!
phoebe Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
ross Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
phoebe Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
ross Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
phoebe No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
steve Oh hey, Pheebs!
phoebe Hey!
steve Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
phoebe Yeah, okay, my bad.
joey Hey!
rachel Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
joey Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
rachel Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
joey Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
katie Hi!
joey Hey! Hiya!
rachel Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
katie Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
rachel Oh! Ow!
katie Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
rachel Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
katie Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
rachel Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
katie You're so sweet!
rachel Ohh, you're so sweet!
katie Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
joey Huh.
katie Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
joey Uhh....
katie You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
joey Nah.
ross Phoebe?
phoebe That's what I'm saying.
ross Phoebe? Phoebe?
phoebe Ooh.
ross Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
phoebe No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
ross So uh, what did you tell them about me?
phoebe Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
ross Ohh.
phoebe But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
ross What?!
phoebe Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
ross Ohh, this cake is really good!
phoebe Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
guest_2 Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
steve 3-B!
all Oh yeah, aww!
steve Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
guest_3 Yeah, leave!
all Yeah, get out! Now!
steve Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
phoebe All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
phoebe Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
ross Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
chandler Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
monica I'm Monica.
chandler I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
monica Okay.
chandler Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
monica Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
chandler Monica
monica No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
chandler Will you marry me?
ross Oh-no. No. No.
joey What a bad idea!
rachel Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
monica Chandler, why are you doing this?
chandler I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
monica Chandler.
chandler I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
monica Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
chandler No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
monica Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
chandler Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
monica Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
chandler Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
monica Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
ross Hey!
joey She's right y'know.
ross Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
monica Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
chandler I didn't think I was!
monica Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
chandler Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
joey Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
ross No, I will not!
joey Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
ross You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
phoebe Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
rachel Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
chandler Okay, how long is this going to go on.
monica Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
ross This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
chandler That's not funny.
joey That's not funny at all!
