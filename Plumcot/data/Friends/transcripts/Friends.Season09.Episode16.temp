chandler Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
monica I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
chandler I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
monica I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
chandler Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
monica Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
chandler You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
monica Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
chandler No! We're not borrowing money.
monica Why not?
chandler Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
monica Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
chandler That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
mike I'm gonna go.
phoebe Why??
mike I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
phoebe Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
mike I put that tube top on as a joke.
phoebe I want you to stay.
mike I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..
phoebe Why don't you turn them inside ou...
mike Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
phoebe I'll miss you.
mike Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
phoebe Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
mike No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
phoebe Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
mike So we're doing it?
phoebe Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
mike Yeah!
phoebe I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
monica Hey Joey!
joey Hey!
monica Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
joey I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
monica Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
joey Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
monica But Chandler lent you money!
joey And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
monica Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
joey Oh...how much?
monica Two thousand dollars?
joey Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
monica Yeah...
joey That's right I am!
rachel Hi you guys!
joey_monica Hey!
joey Oo...what's in the bag?
rachel Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
joey Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
monica Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
rachel No. I was just going to do this myself.
joey You're gonna do it?
rachel Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
joey Oh, women can. You can't.
rachel Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
monica You're a pig. And you can't do this.
rachel Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
joey The hardware store is right down the street.
rachel There is a hardware store right down the street?
phoebe Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
mike Phoebe and I are moving in together.
monica_chandler_ross Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
phoebe I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
monica Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
chandler Yeah.... she's not so cute.
mike I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
phoebe Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
mike Yes dear.
monica Is that a bit you guys do?
phoebe Uh huh...we're playing you two.
monica We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
chandler Yes dear.
ross I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
monica I hear wedding bells.
phoebe Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
ross Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
phoebe I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
mike You ready to go?
phoebe Yeah! You bet roomy!
monica Don't you mean..groomy?
mike What are you talking about?
phoebe Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.
phoebe China patterns!!!!!
rachel This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
chandler Hey Joe!
joey Hey!
chandler Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
joey I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
chandler And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
joey Yeah, I know.
chandler What? What do you mean you know?
joey Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
chandler Oh! Right.
joey That's the fastest I have ever thought!
chandler Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
joey Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
chandler Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
joey Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
chandler Oh ok.
joey I am on fire!
chandler Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
joey Err... Kind of.
chandler I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
joey Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
chandler What?
joey Something personal.
chandler What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
woman Excuse me.
joey Boob job.
monica I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
joey Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
mike Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
phoebe Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
mike I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
phoebe Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
mike Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
phoebe What do you mean?
mike Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
phoebe Oh. Wow.
mike It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
phoebe Was it really that bad?
mike At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
phoebe Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
mike Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
phoebe But it's just...
mike Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
phoebe Oh!
mike I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
phoebe No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
mike Trust me, I will never...
phoebe Yeah I get that.
rachel Hi!
monica So you gave in and decided to call someone?
rachel Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
handyman You're all set.
rachel Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
handyman Thanks.....
chandler Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
rachel Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
monica Thank you?
chandler Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
monica Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
chandler No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
monica Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
chandler Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
monica Okay...
chandler I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
rachel Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
monica I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
rachel I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
monica Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
rachel No you really think that's what it is?
monica You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
rachel Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!
phoebe Hi
ross Hey!
phoebe Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
ross Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
phoebe No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
ross Why?
phoebe Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
ross Never?
phoebe Never.
ross wow, are you still going to move in with him?
phoebe I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
ross Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
phoebe That's not how you really feel is it?
ross No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
phoebe Seriously? You divorce-o?
ross If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
phoebe It's ok that's how you feel.
ross But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
phoebe I do love Mike.
ross Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
phoebe Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
ross The Divorcer, to the rescue!
phoebe It's not cooler.
ross Yeah I just hurt it.
joey Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
chandler Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
monica Honey?
chandler Yeah?
monica About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
chandler But honey you don't have to.
monica I'm going to get bigger!
chandler Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
rachel Argh. fascist
monica Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
chandler your ass?!?!?
rachel Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
chandler They...do that?
monica It's kind of a package deal!
chandler God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
monica I thought I was something that we both wanted!
chandler Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
rachel Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
chandler What?
rachel Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
joey Because she is!
monica Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
joey Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
monica_rachel_chandler It's over/Joe!
joey OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
ross Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
phoebe Better.
mike Very cool.
ross Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
phoebe Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
ross Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
phoebe What do you mean?
ross Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
phoebe They are awfully boxy...
ross I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
phoebe Uh huh.
ross Hey hey, can I help?
chandler Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
ross You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
joey Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
rachel Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
phoebe Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
mike No but... You don't want to get married either right?
phoebe Right. Except that I do want to get married.
joey Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
mike You wanna get married?
phoebe Someday.
chandler Aaaaand....... hernia.
phoebe I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
mike But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
phoebe Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
mike I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
phoebe But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
mike Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
phoebe Are you gonna change yours?
mike No.
phoebe Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
mike But I don't want this to end.
phoebe I don't want it to end either.
mike I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
phoebe Yeah.
mike Ok... so... Goodbye.
chandlerjoeyrachelmonica Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
rachel I'm so sorry Pheebs.
monica We're all sorry...
chandler Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
joey AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
