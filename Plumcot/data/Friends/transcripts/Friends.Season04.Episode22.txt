phoebe_buffay That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
monica_geller That's also like the tenth time you told us.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause - Oh! I'm pregnant!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, did... you want a cookie?
phoebe_buffay Thank you so much.
rachel_green So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?

chandler_bing Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
dr_ross_geller So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
chandler_bing Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
dr_ross_geller I sort've already asked Chandler.
joey_tribbiani What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
dr_ross_geller Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
joey_tribbiani Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
chandler_bing You can be the best man when I get married.
joey_tribbiani I'll never get to be a best man!
dr_ross_geller Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, you - yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
joey_tribbiani What about me?! You-you just said I could!
chandler_bing I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you're not picking me.
dr_ross_geller Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
chandler_bing I'm not even... I'm not even
dr_ross_geller Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
joey_tribbiani Yes! Shame about you man.

monica_geller I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
rachel_green Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
monica_geller Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
rachel_green Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
monica_geller Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
rachel_green Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
monica_geller Oh, she's gonna love that!

chandler_bing You slept with the stripper?
joey_tribbiani Of course!!
phoebe_buffay Hi, guys.
rachel_green Hi! Phoebe.
monica_geller Hi Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay I-I wanted to apologise if I - y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
rachel_green No we
monica_geller Hormones.
rachel_green hormones, yeah.
phoebe_buffay Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
monica_geller Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
phoebe_buffay Good. Y'know - no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
rachel_green Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
rachel_green It just might be too hard, given the history and all that
phoebe_buffay Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
rachel_green Well, h-how is this like that?
phoebe_buffay Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know
rachel_green I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that
phoebe_buffay Alrighty, here come the water works.
joey_tribbiani Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
dr_ross_geller Hey guys!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey
dr_ross_geller I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
joey_tribbiani So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, right!
joey_tribbiani I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
dr_ross_geller That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
chandler_bing So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
dr_ross_geller Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
chandler_bing So you might say, it's a magic ring.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, the stripper stole it.
dr_ross_geller My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
chandler_bing Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
dr_ross_geller All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
joey_tribbiani Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
dr_ross_geller Not on you! On the stripper!
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
dr_ross_geller Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
joey_tribbiani I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
dr_ross_geller So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
joey_tribbiani Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I
chandler_bing Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
joey_tribbiani Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
monica_geller Here's your tea Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay It's so good. Oh, thanks.
rachel_green Good.
monica_geller I'm so glad you liked it.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green What?! She made the tea!
phoebe_buffay Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
rachel_green You what?
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
monica_geller Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
rachel_green Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
phoebe_buffay No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
monica_geller Rachel, get the book! The book!
rachel_green Okay! Okay! Here!
monica_geller The Bible?!
rachel_green I don't know!
joey_tribbiani All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
dr_ross_geller Diverse.
the_stripper Did anybody call for security?
chandler_bing You be cool.
the_stripper Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
dr_ross_geller Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
chandler_bing Way to be cool, man.
the_stripper What's he talking about?
joey_tribbiani There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
the_stripper Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode22 Yeah!
dr_ross_geller We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
the_stripper Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
chandler_bing Marry me.
joey_tribbiani I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
rachel_green I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
phoebe_buffay Well, do you see any babies?
monica_geller How do you feel?
phoebe_buffay Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
rachel_green Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
phoebe_buffay I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
monica_geller Some moms do that.
phoebe_buffay Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
monica_geller Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay.
rachel_green No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
monica_geller I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
rachel_green And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
phoebe_buffay They are gonna love me.
rachel_green Oh!
phoebe_buffay Thanks you guys! Again.
monica_geller Oh, sweetie!
phoebe_buffay You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
monica_geller@rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay Just kidding. Ahh!
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
joey_tribbiani If anything should happen to him
dr_ross_geller Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
joey_tribbiani So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
chandler_bing He will, Joe.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
joey_tribbiani I'm so worried about him, y'know?
the_doctor Somebody lose a ring?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
joey_tribbiani H-h-h-how's the duck?
the_doctor He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
dr_ross_geller No, that's all right.
joey_tribbiani No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
chandler_bing Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
chandler_bing No, you should.
joey_tribbiani Now, don't argue with me
dr_ross_geller Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
chandler_bing Really?
