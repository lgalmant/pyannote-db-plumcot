monica_geller Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
chandler_bing Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
monica_geller No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
chandler_bing Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
monica_geller What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
chandler_bing What is the point of having them if we never use them?
monica_geller Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
chandler_bing I will explain it to her.
monica_geller Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
joey_tribbiani wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
tv_announcer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode08 Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
chandler_bing Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo! TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
chandler_bing Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
chandler_bing What are you going to do?
joey_tribbiani I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
chandler_bing Well you proved them wrong.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
dr_ross_geller A lot of people are thankful for those.
woman_at_door#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode08 Hello? Rachel?

amy_green Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
rachel_green Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
amy_green I decorated Dad's office.
rachel_green Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.
amy_green Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
amy_green Oh my God!
rachel_green mh hmm..
amy_green Is this Emmett?
rachel_green Uh.... its Emma.
amy_green Its a girl?
dr_ross_geller Hey Amy.
rachel_green Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
amy_green Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.
dr_ross_geller That was me.
amy_green No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.
dr_ross_geller Still me.
amy_green No, I'm not talking about you. It was your fat friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?
dr_ross_geller Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. All me.
monica_geller Careful. Careful. CAREFUL!
chandler_bing I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
monica_geller I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
chandler_bing Why?
monica_geller well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
chandler_bing Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
phoebe_buffay Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
joey_tribbiani Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey, what's going on Joe?
joey_tribbiani I.. I.. I need a good lie.
phoebe_buffay Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
joey_tribbiani No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
joey_tribbiani I do not.
phoebe_buffay Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
joey_tribbiani Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. He said.. "Joey you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
phoebe_buffay Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
joey_tribbiani Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Sure, what.. what was the work thing?
joey_tribbiani Uh..
phoebe_buffay "Pick up grandma at the airport"?
joey_tribbiani Oh.. man..
rachel_green Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
amy_green Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
dr_ross_geller Sure, we don't live there but...
amy_green Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? I thought you were a doctor.
rachel_green Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
amy_green Ew.
rachel_green God she is unbelievable.
dr_ross_geller I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
rachel_green Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
amy_green Stupid Thanksgiving.
rachel_green What? What happened?
amy_green My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.
dr_ross_geller Don't say that.
amy_green Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.
rachel_green Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
dr_ross_geller Sure, you want to go upstairs?
rachel_green Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
dr_ross_geller You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
rachel_green Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
dr_ross_geller Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
rachel_green Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!
rachel_green Hi.
everyone_there_says#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode08 Hi, hey.
rachel_green Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode08 Hi.
amy_green Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
amy_green wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
joey_tribbiani Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
monica_geller Hi.
monica_geller Hey you.
monica_geller So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
phoebe_buffay Phoe-Be.
amy_green Oh. That's a funny noise.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, I still need some help here
phoebe_buffay Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
joey_tribbiani Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
phoebe_buffay You are a terrific actor.
amy_green Hey. Hey where's the baby?
rachel_green Oh we just put her down for a nap.
amy_green Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.
dr_ross_geller Thank you Amy.
amy_green no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.
phoebe_buffay Thats a great movie.
amy_green Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
dr_ross_geller Emma.
amy_green Emma, Ross wants you.
phoebe_buffay PHOE-BE.
amy_green Why does she keep making that noise?
rachel_green Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
amy_green Well who would?
dr_ross_geller Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
chandler_bing I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
monica_geller yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
amy_green I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
rachel_green See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
amy_green Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's a lump.
chandler_bing You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
amy_green This guy? Seriously?
monica_geller Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
monica_geller Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved.
joey_tribbiani Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
monica_geller No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe I won.
amy_green Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
rachel_green Monica is Ross' sister.
amy_green No, Ross' sister was really fat.
monica_geller That was me.
amy_green No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
rachel_green Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
monica_geller Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
monica_geller Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
amy_green Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
chandler_bing No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
rachel_green Well actually...
chandler_bing Actually what?
dr_ross_geller well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
chandler_bing What?
amy_green Hurts, doesn't it?
joey_tribbiani Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?
chandler_bing So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
dr_ross_geller No, that that is not what we're saying.
joey_tribbiani Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
chandler_bing Well what is wrong with me? Am I. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
rachel_green Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
dr_ross_geller Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
monica_geller Thats not how you see me, is it?
phoebe_buffay No you're all about the fun.
chandler_bing Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
dr_ross_geller No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
chandler_bing Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
dr_ross_geller Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
joey_tribbiani I lie better then that, right?
chandler_bing So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
phoebe_buffay There's your movie!
monica_geller Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
chandler_bing Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
monica_geller Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
chandler_bing Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
monica_geller No you learn these things. You grow into it.
chandler_bing Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
monica_geller I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
monica_geller Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
chandler_bing You said that to me last week.
monica_geller How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.
joey_tribbiani The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
phoebe_buffay It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, what happened?
joey_tribbiani Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
phoebe_buffay No! Nothing with a raccoon.
joey_tribbiani Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it.
monica_geller Oh wait.. What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Setting the table.
phoebe_buffay Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
monica_geller Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
dr_ross_geller Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
chandler_bing Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.
amy_green Ucch. Uchh. In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
rachel_green UCHH!
amy_green You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
rachel_green Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
amy_green This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.
rachel_green What? What carrer?
amy_green Um.. I'm a decorator.
rachel_green Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
amy_green Why can't you ever be supportive?
rachel_green Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
amy_green Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
rachel_green I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
dr_ross_geller Emma.
rachel_green Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
amy_green How hard could it be? You do it.
joey_tribbiani ooh oooh..
amy_green Do you want to know why you don't want me to have the baby?
rachel_green uh huh.
amy_green Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
rachel_green Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
amy_green Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
rachel_green Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
amy_green Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
rachel_green I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
amy_green Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
rachel_green ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
amy_green You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
dr_ross_geller Too far, Amy. Too far.
rachel_green You take that back.
amy_green No.
rachel_green Take it back!
amy_green No! What are you going to do? Make me?
rachel_green Heey man, I work out.
amy_green So do I.
rachel_green I do pilates.
amy_green I do yoga.
rachel_green Bring it on!
monica_geller Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
rachel_green Did you just push me?
amy_green Uh, yeah I think I did.
rachel_green Alright. Thats it!
monica_geller Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
rachel_green Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
phoebe_buffay Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
joey_tribbiani What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
rachel_green Ew! Gross.
chandler_bing Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
amy_green I'm sorry.
rachel_green Mon, I'm so sorry.
chandler_bing Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
amy_green Sorry.
chandler_bing By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
dr_ross_geller Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
chandler_bing Oh yeah? Well thanks.
dr_ross_geller So, so now do I get Joey?
chandler_bing Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
rachel_green Are you okay Mon?
monica_geller uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
phoebe_buffay It's all right. You can mourn.
monica_geller Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
joey_tribbiani Actually its not pies, its just pie.
monica_geller I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
rachel_green Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
amy_green So you're going to give me the baby?
rachel_green Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
amy_green You are not going to regret this.
rachel_green She needs changing.
chandler_bing Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
phoebe_buffay Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
chandler_bing Nope...
phoebe_buffay Broke them all, huh?
chandler_bing Yep...
phoebe_buffay You gonna tell her?
chandler_bing Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
monica_geller Like only if the queen comes?
chandler_bing Maybe not even then.
joey_tribbiani Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay No problem! Next week: stealing...
monica_geller Bye plates!
joey_tribbiani Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
monica_geller What? Something happened with the plates?
joey_tribbiani Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
