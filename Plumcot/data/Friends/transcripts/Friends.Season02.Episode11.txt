dr_ross_geller Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
carol_willick So how did everything go?
dr_ross_geller Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
carol_willick Well, we've gotta go.
dr_ross_geller Ok.
carol_willick Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you and me?
carol_willick Uh, no, Susan and me.
susan_bunch The other us.
dr_ross_geller Ok.
carol_willick We're uh, we're getting married.
dr_ross_geller As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
carol_willick Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
dr_ross_geller Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
carol_willick Look I just thought that...
dr_ross_geller No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
susan_bunch Is your finger caught in that chair?
dr_ross_geller Mmm hmmm.
carol_willick Want us to go?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
joey_tribbiani It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
monica_geller Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Yes!
monica_geller They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
dr_ross_geller Would it matter?
monica_geller Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
joey_tribbiani Are you really not going?
dr_ross_geller I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
monica_geller They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
dr_ross_geller If you wanna call that a reason.
chandler_bing Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
monica_geller Ross, I thought you were over this.
dr_ross_geller Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
joey_tribbiani Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
rachel_green Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
joey_tribbiani No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
chandler_bing Whoa, she's pretty.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
rachel_green I'm sorry, what?
monica_geller What?
joey_tribbiani It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
chandler_bing Oh, ok.
joey_tribbiani There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
mrs_wallace#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode11 Is she gonna be all right?
joey_tribbiani I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
chandler_bing Nice!
rachel_green That's great!
dr_ross_geller Excellent!
chandler_bing For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
dr_ross_geller That is so good! Do it again!
joey_tribbiani All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
chandler_bing That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
dr_ross_geller No no, that's me.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah.
dr_ross_geller Oh, hello.
phoebe_buffay Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
dr_ross_geller Is everything ok?
phoebe_buffay Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
dr_ross_geller Oh my god.
chandler_bing That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
monica_geller Oh, honey.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
rachel_green What do you mean?
phoebe_buffay I think it went into me.
monica_geller God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
chandler_bing Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
rachel_green Ok, who ordered what?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
chandler_bing Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
rachel_green Oh god.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
rachel_green I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
phoebe_buffay Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
joey_tribbiani Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
sandra_green There she is.
rachel_green Mom!
sandra_green Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
rachel_green Pretty much.
sandra_green Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
rachel_green This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
sandra_green Oh hello, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hi, Mrs. Green.
sandra_green So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
rachel_green Oh Mom!
sandra_green If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
chandler_bing Believe me, sometimes that happens.
sandra_green This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
rachel_green Really?
sandra_green Yes.
phoebe_buffay I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
sandra_green Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
rachel_green Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
sandra_green You have some life here, sweetie.
rachel_green I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
sandra_green I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
rachel_green For...me.
sandra_green Well, not just for you.
rachel_green Well, what do you mean?
sandra_green I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
monica_geller All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
rachel_green Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
monica_geller Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
dr_ross_geller And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
rachel_green None.
joey_tribbiani They didn't fight a lot?
rachel_green No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
phoebe_buffay In my day, divorce was not an option.
joey_tribbiani Hey, look who's up.
rachel_green I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
monica_geller Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
rachel_green Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
chandler_bing You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
phoebe_buffay That's him.
chandler_bing Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
mr_adelman Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
mr_adelman Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
phoebe_buffay Um, do you wanna sit?
mr_adelman Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
phoebe_buffay I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
mr_adelman You're saying, my wife is in you?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
mr_adelman Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
phoebe_buffay Everything?
mr_adelman Everything.
phoebe_buffay Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
mr_adelman Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
mr_adelman Worth a shot, huh?
sandra_green Look at this.
rachel_green These are from Halloween three years ago.
sandra_green Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
rachel_green No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
monica_geller Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
rachel_green Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
monica_geller Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
rachel_green Hey, Mon, you want some help?
monica_geller If you want.
phoebe_buffay Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
rachel_green She's still with you?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
sandra_green This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
rachel_green God!
monica_geller All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
sandra_green That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
rachel_green Oh! What's new in sex?
sandra_green The only man I've ever been with is your father.
monica_geller I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
sandra_green I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
sandra_green No.
rachel_green You want me to talk you out of it?
sandra_green No.
rachel_green Then what? What do you want?
sandra_green I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
rachel_green Why on earth would I understand this?
sandra_green You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
rachel_green Oh.
monica_geller All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
chandler_bing Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
monica_geller Joey, speed it up!
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
phoebe_buffay Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
monica_geller Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
phoebe_buffay Sir! No sir!
monica_geller All right, you!
dr_ross_geller No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
monica_geller All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
chandler_bing Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
monica_geller Hi.
carol_willick How's it going?
monica_geller It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
carol_willick Fine, whatever.
dr_ross_geller What's the matter?
carol_willick Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
dr_ross_geller Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
carol_willick My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
dr_ross_geller Oh my god.
carol_willick I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
dr_ross_geller It's ok. I'm sorry.
carol_willick And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
dr_ross_geller I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
carol_willick You do?
dr_ross_geller Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
carol_willick Of course I do.
dr_ross_geller Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
carol_willick You're right. Of course you're right.
monica_geller So we're back on?
carol_willick We're back on.
monica_geller You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
joey_tribbiani It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
chandler_bing Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
phoebe_buffay Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
carol_willick Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Any time.
carol_willick Ross.
minister You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
monica_geller Would you look at them?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, can't help but.
joey_tribbiani How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
phoebe_buffay I miss Rose.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah?
phoebe_buffay I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
woman You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
phoebe_buffay Ok, that's so nice.
chandler_bing I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
rachel_green Hey, Mom? Having fun?
sandra_green Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
rachel_green There's more alcohol, right?
susan_bunch How you doin'?
dr_ross_geller Ok.
susan_bunch You did a good thing today.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
susan_bunch You wanna dance?
dr_ross_geller No, that's fine.
susan_bunch Come on. I'll let you lead.
dr_ross_geller Ok.
chandler_bing All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
monica_geller Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
dr_ross_geller Well, Mon, I was married.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, me, too, technically.
rachel_green I had a wedding.
monica_geller All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
joey_tribbiani I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
chandler_bing Isn't Ben in this?
all@ Oh, yeah!
