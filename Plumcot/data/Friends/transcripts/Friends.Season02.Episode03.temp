chandler Hey.
monica So how was Joan?
chandler I broke up with her.
chandler They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
rachel Come on, they were not that huge.
chandler I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
monica How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
joey Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
chandler You or me?
ross I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
joey You guys are messin' with me, right?
all Yeah.
joey That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
phoebe You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
chandler Maureen Rosilla.
ross Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
monica Hello, Mr. Heckles.
mr_heckles You're doing it again.
monica We're not doing anything.
mr_heckles You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
rachel You don't have birds.
mr_heckles I could have birds.
monica Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
mr_heckles Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
rachel All right, bye-bye.
chandler Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
ross We'll give you Janice.
phoebe I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
rachel "Oh, my, god."
joey "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
monica Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
rachel We won. We won!
monica Mr. Heckles.
rachel How did this happen?
mr_treeger He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
monica That's terrible.
mr_treeger I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
mr_treeger You never know.
phoebe Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
chandler Ok, Phoebe.
phoebe I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
joey Such as?
phoebe Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
ross Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
phoebe Nah. Not really.
ross You don't believe in evolution?
phoebe I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
ross Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
phoebe Yeah, I just don't buy it.
ross Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
phoebe Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
ross You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
phoebe Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
chandler Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
mr_treeger There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
monica What can we do for you?
mr_boyle All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
monica Well, what about his family?
mr_boyle He didn't have any.
rachel Ok, so let's talk money.
mr_boyle All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
monica I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
rachel Have you ever seen so much crap?
chandler Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
joey Check this out. Can I have this?
ross How can you not believe in evolution?
phoebe Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
ross Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
phoebe Really? You can actually see it?
ross You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
phoebe See, I didn't know that.
ross Well, there you go.
phoebe Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
chandler Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
joey Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
chandler April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
rachel Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
monica Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
rachel What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
monica It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
rachel Well, what about my stuff?
monica You don't have any stuff.
rachel You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
monica No.
rachel Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
monica Mmmmm.
rachel Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
ross Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
phoebe Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
ross Please tell me you're joking.
phoebe Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
ross No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
phoebe What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
ross Is there blood coming out of my ears?
joey Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
chandler Wow, he looks so normal.
phoebe He's even kind of cute.
joey "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
chandler Funniest? Heckles?
joey That's what it says.
chandler Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
phoebe I'd call that excessive.
chandler Whoa!
joey What?
chandler Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
joey So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
chandler I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
joey Have you been here all night?
chandler Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
joey Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
chandler Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
joey All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
chandler What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
joey Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
chandler How do you know that? How?
joey I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
chandler You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
joey Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
chandler Yeah, I understand.
joey You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
chandler You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
joey Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
chandler Hi, it's me.
janice Oh, my, god.
phoebe Janice? You called Janice?
chandler Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
ross You remember Janice, right?
chandler Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
janice Helloo!!
chandler Oh, my, god!
joey Geez, look how fat she got.
janice Hey, it's everybody.
chandler Janice, you're--
janice Yes, I am.
chandler Is it--?
janice Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
chandler Congratulations.
janice Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
chandler You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
janice And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
monica Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
rachel What?
monica Hide the Lamp.
rachel Monica, let it go.
monica Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
rachel Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
phoebe Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
ross Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
phoebe Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
ross It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
phoebe Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
ross There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
phoebe I can't believe you caved.
ross What?
phoebe You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
rachel I am. Let me just get my coat.
monica Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
rachel Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
monica Phoebe, tell her!
phoebe Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
rachel Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
chandler Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
rachel Ok, you win.
monica Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
chandler Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
phoebe Uh huh. Why is that?
chandler If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
monica You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
chandler Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
rachel Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
monica You are not a freak. You're a guy.
rachel She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
monica Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
chandler In a bad way?
monica No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
rachel Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
phoebe Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
monica You made it!
phoebe You're there!
rachel You are ready to make a commitment!
chandler Whoa! Don't know about that.
rachel What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
monica No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
rachel Thank you.
monica That's fine.
chandler Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
joey Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
chandler I'll take that.
joey You want his yearbook?
chandler Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
monica Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
rachel It's really not that big!
chandler Takin' that with you, huh?
joey Oh, yeah.
ross You comin'?
chandler Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
alison Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
chandler Sure.
