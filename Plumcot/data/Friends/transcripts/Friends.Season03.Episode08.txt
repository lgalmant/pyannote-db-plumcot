rachel_green Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
chandler_bing I will have one.
chandler_bing Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
dr_ross_geller Neither will I.
phoebe_buffay No, no, it's just my tooth.
chandler_bing All right I'll have one.
dr_ross_geller So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
phoebe_buffay No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
chandler_bing See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
dr_ross_geller Why? Why can't you go to him?
phoebe_buffay Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
chandler_bing That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
rachel_green Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
rachel_green And all these people actually died?
phoebe_buffay Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
phoebe_buffay Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
dr_ross_geller Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
gunther Oh, like you don't already have everything.
phoebe_buffay Ow! Ow!
rachel_green Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
phoebe_buffay All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
rachel_green I promise.
phoebe_buffay Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
joey_tribbiani Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
dr_ross_geller No, no he's not.
monica_geller You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
dr_ross_geller What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
joey_tribbiani Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
rachel_green Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
joey_tribbiani It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
phoebe_buffay Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
joey_tribbiani Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
dr_ross_geller Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
joey_tribbiani What did they do?
dr_ross_geller Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
monica_geller So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
dr_ross_geller Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
rachel_green Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
dr_ross_geller You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey, Ross?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani I've got a science question.
dr_ross_geller Hmm?
joey_tribbiani If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
dr_ross_geller Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
rachel_green Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.

monica_geller Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
rachel_green Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
monica_geller He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
rachel_green We're not?!
monica_geller No we're not.
rachel_green All right, I like that.
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
monica_geller Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
rachel_green I cannot push it in!
monica_geller Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
rachel_green Okay, okay, okay.
monica_geller I got it!
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
rachel_green Or. We could put a hat on his head.
monica_geller A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
rachel_green We need a hat..
monica_geller Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
rachel_green Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
monica_geller Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
rachel_green Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
monica_geller Give it. Give it.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller@rachel_green Oh!!
rachel_green Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
chandler_bing Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
joey_tribbiani I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
chandler_bing Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
chandler_bing That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
chandler_bing All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
joey_tribbiani No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
chandler_bing Why not?!
joey_tribbiani Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
chandler_bing What is the thing?
joey_tribbiani Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.

chandler_bing Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
joey_tribbiani I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
monica_geller It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
rachel_green Right.
monica_geller Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
phoebe_buffay No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
rachel_green See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.

ben_geller Monica.
monica_geller Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
ben_geller Monica bang!
rachel_green Okay, I heard that.
monica_geller Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
monica_geller Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
ben_geller Monica bang!
monica_geller Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
rachel_green Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
monica_geller You okay?
rachel_green Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
janice How's my Bing-a-ling?
chandler_bing Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
janice Why are your eyes so white?
chandler_bing You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
janice Oh my God!!
chandler_bing All right!
janice How did you know?
chandler_bing Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
janice In the park?
chandler_bing No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
janice Just those two!
chandler_bing Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
janice Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
chandler_bing Here.

janice I don't know.
phoebe_buffay Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
monica_geller Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
rachel_green Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
joey_tribbiani You said number two.
rachel_green I also said number one.
joey_tribbiani I know.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Everyone.
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller How's my little boy?
rachel_green He's perfect, he's never been better.
dr_ross_geller What'd you do, take him whaling?
ben_geller Monica.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
ben_geller Monica bang!
monica_geller Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
phoebe_buffay Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
joey_tribbiani Uh.
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
rachel_green Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
joey_tribbiani I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
monica_geller All right, we should call somebody.
dr_ross_geller And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
rachel_green Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
monica_geller How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
joey_tribbiani Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Well, now we got a reason.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
chandler_bing All right.
joey_tribbiani Hey uh, what's a matter?
chandler_bing I talked to Janice.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God, is she going back to him?
chandler_bing She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
joey_tribbiani What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
chandler_bing I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
joey_tribbiani Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
chandler_bing Come on, tell me.
joey_tribbiani All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
chandler_bing What? What are you, what are you talking about?
joey_tribbiani They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
dr_ross_geller Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
rachel_green Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
dr_ross_geller It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
rachel_green I did!
dr_ross_geller I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
rachel_green I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
dr_ross_geller Monica did it?
dr_ross_geller Monica?
monica_geller Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
monica_geller No. Why?
dr_ross_geller Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
monica_geller Really?!
dr_ross_geller Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
monica_geller Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
rachel_green I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
monica_geller You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
dr_ross_geller Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
rachel_green I'll get the hat.
chandler_bing Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
janice Okay.
chandler_bing I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
janice Wow!
chandler_bing Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
janice Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
chandler_bing Then don't leave me!
janice What?
chandler_bing Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
janice No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
chandler_bing No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
janice I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Ohhh. Don't go.
janice No, I-I-I gotta go.
chandler_bing No. No! No! No!
janice Honey, honey, people are looking.
chandler_bing I don't care! I don't care!!
janice Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
chandler_bing You can't leave! I have your shoe!
janice Good-bye Chandler Bing.
gunther Rachel has those in burgendy.
joey_tribbiani All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
dr_ross_geller Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
phoebe_buffay I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
joey_tribbiani All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
phoebe_buffay He's alive! He's a-live!!!
monica_geller And yet, we're still poking him.
joey_tribbiani Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
dr_ross_geller He does not look happy.
rachel_green Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
joey_tribbiani Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
chandler_bing I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
phoebe_buffay Love....
chandler_bing@phoebe_buffay I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
chandler_bing No you know I don't mind.
chandler_bing@phoebe_buffay Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
chandler_bing I know.
phoebe_buffay I know.
chandler_bing I've found.
phoebe_buffay I've found....
chandler_bing@phoebe_buffay ..in you, my endless love. My endless love.
