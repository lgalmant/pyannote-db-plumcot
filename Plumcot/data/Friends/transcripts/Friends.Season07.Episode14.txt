dr_ross_geller Happy birthday!!!
monica_geller Happy birthday!!!
all@ Rach! Come on! Rach!
monica_geller It's your birthday!
tag_jones Hey.
chandler_bing She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
tag_jones Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
joey_tribbiani They do!
phoebe_buffay Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
monica_geller Chocolate-chip pancakes!
dr_ross_geller We've got presents!
rachel_green Good ones?
monica_geller They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
rachel_green Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
joey_tribbiani Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
dr_ross_geller Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
joey_tribbiani Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
rachel_green Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
dr_ross_geller Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
rachel_green Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
chandler_bing No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
joey_tribbiani And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
monica_geller Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
rachel_green Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
all@ Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
rachel_green There you go!
phoebe_buffay I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
rachel_green Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
tag_jones Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
rachel_green Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
monica_geller Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
dr_ross_geller How hot do I look in this, huh?!
chandler_bing Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
dr_ross_geller That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
joey_tribbiani Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
monica_geller I can't believe you bought this.
rachel_green Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
dr_ross_geller Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
dr_ross_geller Damnit!
phoebe_buffay Okay, who's next?
rachel_green Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
phoebe_buffay Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
rachel_green So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
tag_jones Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
rachel_green Get out, get out of my apartment.
monica_geller All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
phoebe_buffay Least of all you.
tag_jones Why? What you'd do?
monica_geller Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
chandler_bing Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
joey_tribbiani But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
chandler_bing Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
judy_geller You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
chandler_bing Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
jack_geller It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
chandler_bing Ohh!
rachel_green Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
chandler_bing Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
jack_geller Crap.
chandler_bing Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
monica_geller Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
chandler_bing Hey-hey are you drunk?
monica_geller Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!

monica_geller Really?! You promise?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'll take care of it.
monica_geller Okay. I love you so much.
chandler_bing Okay we have to do something about your breath.
monica_geller What about your breath?!

joey_tribbiani Dude, you soooo need this car.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
phoebe_buffay Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Right, why do you keep saying that?

ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
phoebe_buffay Wait!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Oh, it's you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. What?!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
phoebe_buffay Nu-uh!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
phoebe_buffay You have your birth certificate?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
phoebe_buffay Our mom.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Right! Okay.
phoebe_buffay Do you have my birth certificate?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yeah.
phoebe_buffay I just lost a whole year of my life.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Okay.
phoebe_buffay Your middle name is Pamela?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yes.
phoebe_buffay Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Yes! Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay That's my first name.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode14 Right, okay, then no.
chandler_bing Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
monica_geller Yay!
chandler_bing See? Here we go.
jack_geller Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
judy_geller Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
monica_geller Paul!
chandler_bing Phil.
monica_geller Phil!
chandler_bing Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
phoebe_buffay Hey, what's going on?
chandler_bing Monica's a little drunk.
phoebe_buffay Yay! I love drunk Monica!
monica_geller Awwwww
chandler_bing Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
phoebe_buffay Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
rachel_green What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
chandler_bing Monica's wasted.
dr_ross_geller Maybe that will liven up this party.
chandler_bing Okay, will you just go help her change please!
rachel_green Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
joey_tribbiani Yep.
tag_jones This one's from me.
rachel_green Ahh!
tag_jones It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
rachel_green A scooter!
dr_ross_geller Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
rachel_green No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
chandler_bing Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
chandler_bing For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
rachel_green Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
chandler_bing No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
rachel_green No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
chandler_bing No, because you're not a grandmother!
rachel_green No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
monica_geller All you had to do was buy the card!
dr_ross_geller Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
rachel_green Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids
phoebe_buffay Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
rachel_green As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
phoebe_buffay If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
rachel_green So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant
monica_geller Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
rachel_green No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
dr_ross_geller Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
rachel_green No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
joey_tribbiani Will you quit hoggin' it!
rachel_green I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
dr_ross_geller You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
chandler_bing Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
chandler_bing How are you feeling?
monica_geller You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
dr_ross_geller I really wish that you wouldn't.
chandler_bing Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
phoebe_buffay Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
chandler_bing Pheebs!!
phoebe_buffay Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
judy_geller Speech! Come on Monica!
dr_ross_geller Come on!
all@ Come on! Speech!
jack_geller Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
judy_geller Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
chandler_bing I think it's necessary.
monica_geller I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends
phoebe_buffay Wooo!! Hoo!!
monica_geller I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
phoebe_buffay Okay quick, help me get this off!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!!
phoebe_buffay I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
joey_tribbiani Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
phoebe_buffay Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
joey_tribbiani That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
phoebe_buffay Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
joey_tribbiani Like what?
phoebe_buffay Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
monica_geller Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
phoebe_buffay No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
rachel_green Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
joey_tribbiani Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
monica_geller Oh man!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller He's gonna eat the cake!
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah.
joey_tribbiani Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
dr_ross_geller Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
rachel_green Ross, I really don't think
dr_ross_geller Lift!! And slide!
chandler_bing Okay, here we go.
dr_ross_geller All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
rachel_green Hey Joey, can I
joey_tribbiani Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
rachel_green Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
rachel_green Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
joey_tribbiani Okay!
rachel_green Not in the street!!
joey_tribbiani Yes!
rachel_green Hi.
tag_jones Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
tag_jones How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
rachel_green Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
tag_jones Okay.
rachel_green Umm
tag_jones What's up?
rachel_green Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't
tag_jones Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
rachel_green Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
tag_jones Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
rachel_green Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
tag_jones Twenty-four actually.
rachel_green Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
tag_jones Me too.
rachel_green Yeah, I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Hey! How'd it go?
rachel_green Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
phoebe_buffay You did the right thing.
joey_tribbiani I don't like this anymore.
chandler_bing Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
dr_ross_geller God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
joey_tribbiani Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
