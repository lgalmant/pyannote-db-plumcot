commercial_voiceover Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...
commercial_voiceover ..With MonkeyShine Beer. MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.]
ross That commercial always makes me so sad.
joey Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
ross I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
phoebe I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
monica And the fact that they're both monkeys.
ross Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
rachel Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
ross Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
chandler Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
joey Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
chandler Rhythm?
joey No, my first fan mail.
all Alright!
monica 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
rachel Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
monica This wasn't addressed to
joey Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
ross Hey guys.
all Hey.
phoebe Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
ross Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
chandler You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
rachel Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
phoebe Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
phoebe I know, I know. Hello.
rob Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
phoebe Hi Rob Dohnen.
rob I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
phoebe Oh, wow.
rob Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
phoebe Oh, I would love to have kids. you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
joey Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
chandler Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
chandler Hello.
erica It's Erica.
joey Ah, the stalker.
erica Never mind, it's open.
chandler Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
joey Let's get out of here.
chandler The one time they're not home.
joey OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
chandler That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
joey She's comin'.
erica It's me.
joey Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
chandler Wait, wait, wait.
erica Hi.
joey Erica.
lipson Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
ross Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
lipson Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
ross Oh my God, what happened?
lipson Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
ross I can't believe this.
lipson I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
ross Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
lipson I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
ross Zoo dollars?
lipson Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
kids Ooohhh.
phoebe I know.
monica I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
chandler Well, you remember Cathy Bates in
rachel_and_monica Yeah.
chandler Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
rachel And she's not crazy?
chandler Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
rachel Oh my God.
monica Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
chandler Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
rob You OK?
phoebe No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
rob That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
phoebe I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
ross I was thinkin' about it.
phoebe OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
all Hi Phoebe.
phoebe OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.
erica Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
joey Yeah it is. what?
erica Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
joey Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
erica Who's they?
joey No one.
erica Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. but I won't.
joey Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
erica No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
joey Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
waiter Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
erica Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
janitor Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
ross Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men
janitor It's about your monkey. It's alive.
erica I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
joey Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
erica No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
joey But that's what...
erica I should just be happy to be near you.
joey Hey I-
erica Hey what?
joey That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
monica Excellent!
chandler Very informative!
rachel Not at all inappropriate!
phoebe Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
rob That was great, the kids loved you.
phoebe Yay, I rock.
rob And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
phoebe But.
rob How did you know there was a but?
phoebe I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
rob The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
phoebe I can do that.
rob Really?
phoebe Yeah.
rob Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
phoebe Thinkin' about it.
janitor Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
ross Buddy, my monkey?
janitor Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
ross Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
janitor The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
ross That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
janitor Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
ross That guy Lipson?
janitor Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
ross No, I, I only know Lipson.
janitor Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
ross Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
janitor Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
ross Of course.
janitor Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
ross This is unbelievable.
janitor So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
ross Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
janitor Maybe.
ross But you already told me everything.
ross Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
rachel Well, so what're you gonna do?
ross Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
chandler That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
phoebe OK, hi again.
all Hi Phoebe.
phoebe Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
tv_doctor You're the only one who can save her Drake.
joey_on_tv Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
ross Well, there goes my whole belief system.
erica It's Erica.
joey Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
rachel No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
joey Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
rachel Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
monica Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
joey Hey Erica, c'mon in.
erica How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
joey Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
erica Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
joey Who?
erica Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
joey It's not what you think, that was...
erica You told me I was the only one.
joey Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
erica Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
joey Somebody wanna help me out here?
rachel Oh, I know, I know.
erica How, how can you be here and there.
joey 'Cause it's a television show.
erica Drake, what're you getting at?
joey I'm not Drake.
ross That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
erica Is this true?
rachel Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
monica And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
chandler And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
erica Is all this true?
joey Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
erica Oh Hans.
ross Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
joey Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
erica I'll never forget you Hans.
joey OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
phoebe Fired! Why?
rob The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
phoebe I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
rob No.
phoebe I see.
rob Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
phoebe No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
rob I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
phoebe Who's Barney.
ross Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming
rachel You're kidding.
joey This is amazing.
ross I know.
joey I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
phoebe OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
rachel OK.
kid Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
phoebe Um, yeah I guess that's me.
kid She's here.
ross This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
chandler What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
security_guard C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
ross Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
security_guard I'm sorry guys, closed set.
ross Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
security_guard Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
monica Ross, there he is.
ross Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.
