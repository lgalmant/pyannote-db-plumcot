joey_tribbiani Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
chandler_bing Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
joey_tribbiani Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
chandler_bing I could fall asleep at a play.
phoebe_buffay What is it?
joey_tribbiani It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
monica_geller It sounds interesting!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
phoebe_buffay I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
joey_tribbiani You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
dr_ross_geller What? How come that you don't have to go!
joey_tribbiani I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
chandler_bing Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
rachel_green Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
joey_tribbiani Hey, here you go.
rachel_green Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
monica_geller No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
rachel_green No reason.
monica_geller No, no, Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah
monica_geller Who do you wanna fool around with?
rachel_green Nobody, forget it!
rachel_green Maybe.
monica_geller You can't!
rachel_green Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
monica_geller In the hall.
monica_geller You wanna fool around with Joey?
rachel_green Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
monica_geller Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
rachel_green Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
monica_geller Who, who are they?
rachel_green I know them from work.
monica_geller Both of them?
rachel_green No, one of them...
monica_geller Which one?
rachel_green I don't know, what were the names I just said?
monica_geller Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
rachel_green All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
monica_geller What the hell are you cooking!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
chandler_bing Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
dr_ross_geller There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
monica_geller What's so bad about that?
dr_ross_geller It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
monica_geller : Ross?
dr_ross_geller These aren't suede.
charlie_wheeler Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
gunther No.
dr_ross_geller Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
charlie_wheeler Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
charlie_wheeler It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
dr_ross_geller Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
monica_geller Is he gonna introduce us?
chandler_bing No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
charlie_wheeler And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
dr_ross_geller Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
monica_geller Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
dr_ross_geller We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
charlie_wheeler Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
dr_ross_geller I don't think so.
charlie_wheeler I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
dr_ross_geller Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?
charlie_wheeler You don't think we should wait for him?
dr_ross_geller You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
professor_spafford Professor Geller?
dr_ross_geller Oh, damn it!
jane#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode20 Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani What's happenin'?
rachel_green Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
rachel_green Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
message#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode20 "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
joey_tribbiani Stupid Jane Rogers!!
rachel_green You are having a party tonight??
joey_tribbiani Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
rachel_green And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
joey_tribbiani I do it every year.
rachel_green You do that every year??
joey_tribbiani I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
rachel_green Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
joey_tribbiani Yeah...
rachel_green And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
joey_tribbiani Yeah...
rachel_green OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you guys went for that one!
rachel_green Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
joey_tribbiani You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
rachel_green Well, then so you just invite me...!
joey_tribbiani Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
rachel_green Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
joey_tribbiani Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
rachel_green OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system!
professor_spafford And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
dr_ross_geller So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
professor_spafford And that's not all I'm allergic to.
dr_ross_geller Oh, it's not over!
professor_spafford I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
dr_ross_geller So basically all nuts?
professor_spafford Interestingly... no.
charlie_wheeler Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
professor_spafford If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.
charlie_wheeler Oh my God!!
dr_ross_geller I've lost the will to live.
charlie_wheeler Let's ditch him!
dr_ross_geller What?
charlie_wheeler Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
dr_ross_geller Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
charlie_wheeler Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
charlie_wheeler Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
phoebe_buffay Ah, ah.
charlie_wheeler Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
dr_ross_geller Ranion's theory of species variegation?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
monica_geller So, did you two have fun?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
monica_geller And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
rachel_green Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
dr_ross_geller Really? Wh-what's wrong?
rachel_green I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
charlie_wheeler Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
rachel_green .. Ok, who is this?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
rachel_green Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
monica_geller Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
rachel_green Sure! Oh...
monica_geller You're not sick!
rachel_green What? Yes, I am!
monica_geller Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??
rachel_green When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
monica_geller You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
rachel_green Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
monica_geller Ok, what is this?
rachel_green Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
monica_geller WHAT?
dr_ross_geller Wh-what's going on?
monica_geller Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
rachel_green And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
charlie_wheeler I thought you came to say you were sick.
rachel_green Ok professor or detective?
phoebe_buffay Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
rachel_green Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
phoebe_buffay And that horrible museum tour!
dr_ross_geller No, I arranged that...
joey_tribbiani Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
phoebe_buffay We know about your party Joey.

kyle_lowder Hi.
monica_geller I love you!
joey_tribbiani Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
monica_geller Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
phoebe_buffay Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
monica_geller Oh my God! Chandler!
chandler_bing Where the hell is everybody?
bitter_woman_on_stage Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
monica_geller Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
rachel_green Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
monica_geller Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
matthew_ashford It was nice to meet you Rachel.
rachel_green Nice to meet you.
matthew_ashford Call me.
rachel_green Ok
monica_geller We will!!
monica_geller Look at you with all the guys!
rachel_green Yeah!
monica_geller I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
rachel_green Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
monica_geller Please... Chandler is the love of my life..... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy!
dr_ross_geller So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
charlie_wheeler Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
dr_ross_geller Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
charlie_wheeler Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
dr_ross_geller You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
charlie_wheeler Yeah...
dr_ross_geller .. And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
charlie_wheeler Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
dr_ross_geller Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
charlie_wheeler Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
dr_ross_geller Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
charlie_wheeler Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
dr_ross_geller Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
charlie_wheeler A guy who won two.
dr_ross_geller Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
charlie_wheeler Yeah... for three years.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
charlie_wheeler .. no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
charlie_wheeler No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
dr_ross_geller Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
phoebe_buffay Hey Ross!
rachel_green How is it going with Charlie?
dr_ross_geller Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
phoebe_buffay Oh, What's the matter?
dr_ross_geller She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
rachel_green I always loved that!!
dr_ross_geller Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Worse?
dr_ross_geller Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... "Can we walk"? Oh, you... you like that?
phoebe_buffay No.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Come on! I think this is funny!
bitter_woman_on_stage Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
chandler_bing oh yes, God yes!!
bitter_woman_on_stage Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. How could he leave me?!?!
chandler_bing I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
dr_ross_geller Nice to meet you.
dirk Hey! So what show are you on?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
joey_tribbiani It's a science.
dirk Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
dr_ross_geller Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
dirk Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
dr_ross_geller I'd lead with that.
monica_geller That's it, just sign right on the bra
joey_tribbiani Monica!
monica_geller Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
joey_tribbiani What have you got there?
dr_ross_geller Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
joey_tribbiani Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
rachel_green I think I am.
joey_tribbiani Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug This guy's Canadian And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
joey_tribbiani Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
rachel_green Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
joey_tribbiani Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
rachel_green Joey, you're so sweet.
joey_tribbiani That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
rachel_green Who ?
joey_tribbiani Me.
rachel_green What? Really?
joey_tribbiani Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
rachel_green Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
joey_tribbiani Gotcha.
rachel_green Oh, Very funny... Joey.
chandler_bing So, how did you enjoy the play?
monica_geller Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
chandler_bing Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
monica_geller You really liked it?
chandler_bing Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
monica_geller Oh really!
chandler_bing Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
monica_geller No!
chandler_bing Did somebody sign your bra?
monica_geller So I got it when I was 13...
phoebe_buffay Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
dr_ross_geller It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
phoebe_buffay Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
phoebe_buffay You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
dr_ross_geller And sexy.
phoebe_buffay Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
phoebe_buffay Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
dr_ross_geller Stop going through my stuff !
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
monica_geller No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
rachel_green Please, what about you and Chandler?
monica_geller That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
rachel_green Well hello !
monica_geller What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
rachel_green I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
monica_geller Alright I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
rachel_green I'm gonna do it.
monica_geller And I can't stop you.
rachel_green No.
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
dr_ross_geller I'm smarter than him!
phoebe_buffay Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
chandler_bing Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
monica_geller Oh, you're so wonderful.
bitter_woman_on_stage Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
chandler_bing Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death
