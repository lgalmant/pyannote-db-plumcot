ross She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
monica I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
ross I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
joey Do we have to know about that?
monica Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
joey I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
chandler Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
ross God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
rachel Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
rachel What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
chandler You have to pick your moments.
phoebe Did I miss it, did I miss it?
ross She's not even here yet.
monica What's with the guitar?
phoebe I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
ross Where the hell have you been?
susan We stopped at the gift shop.
carol I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
ross Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
chandler I used to have that bumper sticker.
chandler You see what I mean.
ross Stopped for a Chunky.
carol Let it go, Ross.
susan I got an extra one. You want this?
ross No.
dr_franzblau Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
ross Dr. Franzblau, hi.
dr_franzblau So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
carol Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
susan They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
ross 59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
susan Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
carol Am I allowed to drink anything?
dr_franzblau Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
ross I'll get it.
susan No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
ross I got it - I'm getting it!
rachel Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
carol Thanks.
rachel And if you need anything else, I - - do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
dr_franzblau It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
rachel Oh, that's funny!
monica I want a baby.
chandler Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
monica Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
chandler Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
joey Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
lydia Knick fan?
joey Oh, yeah.
lydia Oh, boy, do they suck.
joey Hey, listen, lady.......whoa.
lydia Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
joey Oh yeah? And who do you like?
lydia The Celtics.
joey The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
lydia Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
joey Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
lydia There is no father.
joey Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
lydia Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
joey Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
lydia Ok.
phoebe Thanks, Ross.
ross Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
phoebe Ok.
phoebe Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
monica No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
chandler You'll get one.
monica Oh yeah? When?
chandler All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
monica Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
monica Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler No, no, no.
monica What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
chandler Uh, uh.
monica Well?
chandler Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
rachel Hey.
phoebe Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
monica Did you go home and change?
rachel Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
monica No, I haven't seen him.
rachel Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
chandler Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
rachel Yeah, why?
chandler No reason.
lydia Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
joey Tribbiani.
lydia Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
joey Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
lydia She's not much of a phone person.
joey Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
lydia Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
joey Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
lydia Maybe you should.
joey Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
joey You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
lydia Oh, that is so not true.
joey Oh, it is.
lydia It isn't.
joey It is.
lydia Isn't!
ross Breathe.
susan Breathe.
ross Breathe.
susan Breathe.
ross Breathe.
susan Breathe.
carol You're gonna kill me!
ross 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
carol Count faster.
susan It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
ross Who the hell is Jordie?
susan Your son.
ross No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
carol Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
ross What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
carol Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
ross I got it.
susan I got it.
ross I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
susan No, you don't.
carol All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
ross Why?
susan He started it!
ross No, you started it.
susan You did!
carol I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
ross But...
carol Now go!
ross Thanks a lot.
susan See what you did.
ross Yeah, listen...
carol Out!
nurse Breathe, breathe, breathe...
lydia Oh, no.
joey Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
nurse It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
joey Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
nurse Breathe, breathe, breathe.
ross Please. This is so your fault.
susan How, how is this my fault?
ross Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
susan Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
ross You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
susan You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
ross Oh, I'm threatened by you?
susan Yes.
phoebe Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
ross Yeah, Susan.
phoebe Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
phoebe Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
all Help!
ross I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
carol Are they here yet?
rachel No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
carol Ok.
rachel Ok?
carol Ok.
rachel Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
dr_franzblau It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
joey Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's - I was just - yeah, right. Push! Push!
susan What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
ross Help! Help!
phoebe They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
susan_and_ross Help!
monica Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
chandler Where have you been?
joey Oh, just had a baby.
chandler Mazel tov!
dr_franzblau I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
rachel No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
dr_franzblau No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
rachel Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
dr_franzblau No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
rachel Oh.
dr_franzblau I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
rachel I'm a waitress.
dr_franzblau Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
rachel Yeah. Gotcha.
dr_franzblau I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
rachel Ok. That's fine.
lydia So how did you know I was even here?
guy Your mom called me. So is this her?
lydia No, this is a loaner.
guy I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
lydia I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
guy Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
lydia Yeah, they're not so bad.
ross Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
susan The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
ross No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
susan You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
ross Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
phoebe This is so great.
ross You wanna explain that?
phoebe I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
carol Where are they?
monica I'm sure they'll be here soon.
rachel Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
joey Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
chandler You are really frightening me.
chandler Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
dr_franzblau All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
nurse All right, honey, time to start pushing.
carol But they're not here yet!
dr_franzblau I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
carol Oh, god.
ross Ok, got the vent open.
phoebe Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
ross Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
susan What do you see?
phoebe Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
ross Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
janitor Wait! You forgot your legs!
all Push, push!
ross We're here!
carol Where have you been?
ross Long story, honey.
dr_franzblau All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need - Excuse me, could I have this?
nurse All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
all Good luck!
chandler Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
nurse Out!
dr_franzblau All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
ross Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
carol Not.... helping!
dr_franzblau You're doing great, you're doing fine.
ross Hello! Oh, sorry.
susan What do you see? What do you see?
ross We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
susan Oh, look at that.
carol What does he look like?
ross Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
carol Really?
phoebe You guys, he's beautiful!
ross Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
susan No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
ross How 'bout Ben?
susan I like Ben.
carol Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
ross We uh, we just cooked it up.
susan That's what we were off doing.
monica Hi.
ross Hey.
monica Can we come in?
ross I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
phoebe Susan, he looks just like you.
susan Thanks.
rachel Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
chandler I know, I still am one of these.
monica Ross, can I?
ross The head, the head. You gotta...
monica Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
ross Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
chandler And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
monica He is so amazing.
rachel Oh, I know. Look at him.
joey Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
phoebe Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
joey He doesn't do much, does he?
ross No, this is pretty much it.
rachel You guys wanna get some coffee?
all Yeah.
ross All right, I'll see you guys later.
phoebe Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
