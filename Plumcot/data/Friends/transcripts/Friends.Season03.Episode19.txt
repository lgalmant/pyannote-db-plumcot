gunther Here you go.
rachel_green Thank you.
gunther Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
mark_robinson Hi!
rachel_green Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
mark_robinson Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
rachel_green Oh, okay.
mark_robinson I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
rachel_green Wow! Umm....
gunther I dropped a cup.
pete_becker ..so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
monica_geller Oh, this is so great.
pete_becker Yeah, it was.
monica_geller All right then. Bye.
monica_geller Hello, people who do not live here.
all@ Hi! Hello!
monica_geller I gave you a key for emergencies!
phoebe_buffay We were out of Doritos.
dr_ross_geller Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
chandler_bing Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
monica_geller He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
dr_ross_geller Still?!
monica_geller Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
chandler_bing Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
monica_geller Two.
chandler_bing Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
joey_tribbiani Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
dr_ross_geller I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Oh.
chandler_bing Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
the_director Joe. How's it going?
joey_tribbiani Good. Hey.
kate_miller Hi.
joey_tribbiani Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
kate_miller Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
joey_tribbiani Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
kate_miller Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
joey_tribbiani So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
kate_miller Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
joey_tribbiani Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
kate_miller Where do I know you from?
joey_tribbiani Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
kate_miller No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
kate_miller That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
joey_tribbiani See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
kate_miller Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that was real.
phoebe_buffay Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
rachel_green I know.
phoebe_buffay What, so what are you gonna tell him?
rachel_green Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
phoebe_buffay Huh.
rachel_green I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
phoebe_buffay Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
rachel_green I don't have any issues with my Father.
phoebe_buffay Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
joey_tribbiani I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
dr_ross_geller Hello.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
joey_tribbiani Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
dr_ross_geller Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
chandler_bing It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
dr_ross_geller Then be supportive like a guy.
chandler_bing If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller You ah, wanted to see me?
rachel_green Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
dr_ross_geller What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
rachel_green No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
dr_ross_geller Yes.
rachel_green Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Yes, I do.
rachel_green Good.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
rachel_green Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
dr_ross_geller It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
rachel_green Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
dr_ross_geller No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
rachel_green You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
dr_ross_geller I'm just trying to help you, move on.
rachel_green Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
dr_ross_geller Petty...
rachel_green Petty...
dr_ross_geller Petty...
rachel_green Petty...
dr_ross_geller Petty...
rachel_green Small...
dr_ross_geller Small...
rachel_green You are so just doing this out of spite.
dr_ross_geller Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
rachel_green Huh?
dr_ross_geller I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
rachel_green You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
rachel_green yeah-yeah-yeah!!
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
phoebe_buffay So, you're like a zillionaire?
chandler_bing And you're our age. You're our age.
phoebe_buffay Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
pete_becker What like Pete Dakota?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
joey_tribbiani Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
chandler_bing That's not a state Joe.
joey_tribbiani Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
pete_becker I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
all@ Okay.
chandler_bing You're our age!
pete_becker So ah, we on for tomorrow?
monica_geller Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, kinda.
kate_miller Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
joey_tribbiani Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
the_director Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
kate_miller I have a question about this scene.
the_director Yes?
kate_miller Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
the_director Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
kate_miller I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
kate_miller It doesn't say that in the script.
joey_tribbiani It does in mine!
chandler_bing I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
dr_ross_geller You bug me.
chandler_bing Is there any chance you didn't see that?
chandler_bing Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
dr_ross_geller I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
chandler_bing You didn't just break up.
dr_ross_geller Hey, it's been like three weeks!
chandler_bing You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
dr_ross_geller Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
chandler_bing And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
chandler_bing Stop what?!
dr_ross_geller I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
chandler_bing No!! You can't!!
dr_ross_geller Look, they must be stopped!
chandler_bing I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
dr_ross_geller I need juice! People need juice!!
chandler_bing Look man!
dr_ross_geller People need juice!
chandler_bing Listen to me!!
dr_ross_geller Juice, I need...
chandler_bing She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, okay.
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller It's just I miss her so much.
chandler_bing I know.
mark_robinson Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
rachel_green Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
rachel_green Y'know what?
mark_robinson No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
rachel_green I can't do this.
mark_robinson Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
rachel_green Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
mark_robinson Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
rachel_green Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
mark_robinson That's okay.
rachel_green You sure?
mark_robinson Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
spokeswoman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode19 ..has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
pete_becker Hey, can I ask you something?
monica_geller Sure.
pete_becker Where are we?
monica_geller Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
pete_becker Just tell me the truth.
monica_geller Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
pete_becker Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
monica_geller So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
pete_becker Oh, yeah. I know that.
monica_geller I so wanna be attracted to you.
pete_becker But you're not. Okay, good.
monica_geller I'm sorry.
pete_becker Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
monica_geller It's not?
pete_becker I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
monica_geller Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
pete_becker Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
spokeswoman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode19 And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
pete_becker One second.
chandler_bing I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
chandler_bing I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
joey_tribbiani Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
chandler_bing Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
joey_tribbiani God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
chandler_bing I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
chandler_bing I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
chandler_bing Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
kate_miller Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
joey_tribbiani Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
the_director You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
kate_miller Well, that was ah...
joey_tribbiani Better?
kate_miller Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
joey_tribbiani Ah, Kate?
kate_miller Yeah?
joey_tribbiani You ah, you forgot your shoes.
kate_miller I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
joey_tribbiani Hey, listen you ah....
kate_miller Hmm?
joey_tribbiani ..feel like getting a cup of coffee?
kate_miller Umm.
the_director Kate?
kate_miller Yep.
the_director You ready to go?
kate_miller Yeah.
the_director Very nice. Very nice.
kate_miller So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
phoebe_buffay Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
chandler_bing 'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
phoebe_buffay It isn't?
chandler_bing No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hey, Rach, how was work?
rachel_green Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
monica_geller By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
rachel_green Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
monica_geller Something wrong?
rachel_green No. Nothing.
chandler_bing So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
phoebe_buffay Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
chandler_bing What about things that are already gold?
phoebe_buffay Ahh, his work is done.
chandler_bing Okay, let's play my game now.
phoebe_buffay Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
