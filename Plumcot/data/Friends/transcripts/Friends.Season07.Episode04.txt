tag_jones That's it. That's my whole name.
rachel_green That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
tag_jones I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh
rachel_green Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
tag_jones It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn
rachel_green Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
chandler_bing No-no-no-no. Hey!
phoebe_buffay Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
monica_geller Hey sweetie.
chandler_bing Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
monica_geller I can't tell you. It's a secret.
chandler_bing Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
monica_geller Awww. But still no.
chandler_bing No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
monica_geller Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
chandler_bing Oh no-no, I can't do that.
monica_geller If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
monica_geller Oh my God. He threw up?
chandler_bing No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
monica_geller Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
chandler_bing That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
monica_geller That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
rachel_green Chandler, you have an assistant right?
chandler_bing Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
rachel_green No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy
chandler_bing What about him?
rachel_green I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
phoebe_buffay Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
rachel_green Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
phoebe_buffay Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
rachel_green Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
chandler_bing Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!

terry Why don't we start right now!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
terry Here are the audition scenes.
joey_tribbiani Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
terry Why would you think that?
joey_tribbiani Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
terry Everybody has to audition.
joey_tribbiani Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
terry I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
joey_tribbiani Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
rachel_green Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
tag_jones I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
rachel_green Kinda.

rachel_green Oh-ohh, thank you.

monica_geller I made you a surprise.
chandler_bing Oh yeah?
monica_geller Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
chandler_bing Did you not understand the story?
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey! What's up?
monica_geller Ross!
dr_ross_geller Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
chandler_bing Huh.

monica_geller Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
dr_ross_geller Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
monica_geller I'm not laughing.
dr_ross_geller You told her!
chandler_bing Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
dr_ross_geller Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
monica_geller You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
dr_ross_geller How could you tell her?!
chandler_bing I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
dr_ross_geller Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
chandler_bing Du-ude!
monica_geller What happened in Atlantic City?!
dr_ross_geller Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
chandler_bing Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
dr_ross_geller And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
monica_geller You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
chandler_bing In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
dr_ross_geller Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
chandler_bing Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
dr_ross_geller Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.

They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
phoebe_buffay Sorry.
rachel_green I'm sorry Joey.
joey_tribbiani Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
chandler_bing You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
dr_ross_geller All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
chandler_bing Ross came in forth and cried!
monica_geller Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
monica_geller I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
dr_ross_geller Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
monica_geller Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
dr_ross_geller Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
monica_geller It's hard for some people!
chandler_bing Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
monica_geller Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
chandler_bing Hey!!!
monica_geller Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
dr_ross_geller Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
chandler_bing That was you!
dr_ross_geller Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
joey_tribbiani How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
rachel_green Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
joey_tribbiani Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
phoebe_buffay What happened?
joey_tribbiani Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
rachel_green Joey, why would you do that?
joey_tribbiani Because they wanted me to audition!
phoebe_buffay You! An actor?! That's madness!

phoebe_buffay But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.

chandler_bing You have no trouble telling time now right?
monica_geller No!
chandler_bing Quick! What time is it?!
monica_geller I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
chandler_bing Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
monica_geller Yeah?
chandler_bing Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
monica_geller Ohh, absolutely.
dr_ross_geller And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
monica_geller Yeah, definitely!
dr_ross_geller Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
monica_geller Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
dr_ross_geller Man!
chandler_bing Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
rachel_green Hi!

rachel_green Oh really?!
tag_jones Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
rachel_green Oh, did you not want people to know that?
tag_jones But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
rachel_green Why's that?
tag_jones I don't think I should say.
rachel_green Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
tag_jones Okay.
rachel_green 'Kay.
