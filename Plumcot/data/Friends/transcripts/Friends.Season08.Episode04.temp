phoebe Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
chandler Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance
joey Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?

monica We didn't get anything for anyone.
joey Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
monica That you can have.
rachel Hi!
all Hey!
ross Hello!
rachel Welcome home.
ross So, how was the honeymoon?
monica It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
rachel Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
monica Oh great!
chandler Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
monica All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
phoebe Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
rachel Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
joey You're welcome buddy.
ross Yeah, thanks.
rachel And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
ross Umm that's...that's a little misleading.
rachel What is?
ross The lie you just told.
rachel That-that you came on to me?
ross There's the one!
rachel But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
ross Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
joey Whom. That's right.
rachel You know you kissed me first.
ross What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
rachel I was sending you signals?
ross Yeah!
rachel Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.
ross Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
rachel Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
ross Y'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
rachel No please, show me how I begged you!
ross I can show you, I have it on videotape! It's an expression.
phoebe I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
joey Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
chandler Y'know who has a great video camera?
phoebe Greg and Jenny?
monica Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
chandler Let's call 'em.
joey Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
monica Hello? Eighth street deli?
joey Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
monica Uh sorry, wrong number.
chandler Here you go.
monica Hello? It's the deli again!
joey All right! I'll have a sandwich!
monica I don't think this number's right!
chandler What?
phoebe You got fake numbered.
monica What?! People don't do that!
joey Oh I think we do.
monica They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
chandler I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
monica And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
joey Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
phoebe Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
ross Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
phoebe Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
ross Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
phoebe That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
ross Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
joey Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
ross About...about sex? That I hadn't had sex in months?
joey Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
ross Hey!
joey Hey.
ross Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
joey Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
ross I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
joey Whoa, for like months?
ross Five to be lying, six.
joey Six months? Whoa that's rough.
ross Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
joey The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
ross Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!
joey Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
ross Really? Well then tell it to me.
joey Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
ross I'll try to control myself.
joey Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe
ross You were backpacking across Western Europe?
joey Have a nice six more months Ross!
ross Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
joey I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying
ross Why?
kristen Umm, this is great wine.
ross It's from France...In Europe...Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
kristen Really?
ross Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
kristen I studied for a year in Barcelona.
ross Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
kristen I love hiking!
ross Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
kristen I think its Tibidabo.
ross Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
joey Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
ross Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
joey Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
ross No! No, I don't...don't want to.
joey How long since you've seen a girl naked?
ross I was backpacking across Western Europe.
joey I'm not feeling it.
ross I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
joey No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
ross It's been six months! I'm always hot!
joey Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
ross I'll try that.
joey All right now... All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?
ross Thanks.
joey Good luck.
ross Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
joey Yeah?
ross Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.
joey That means a lot to me man.
ross Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel!
rachel Oh Ross!
ross Hi!
rachel Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
ross That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
ross So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything.
chandler Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
monica Yeah, definitely.
ross What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
joey Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
ross Thank you. No!
joey You're right.
ross Joey! No!
joey Loud and clear!
monica I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
joey Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
monica Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
joey Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
phoebe Regina Philange.
chandler I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
monica I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
chandler I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
monica Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
chandler Well maybe it was all of your questions.
monica What about my questions?
chandler The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
monica Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?
chandler Was that another question?
rachel Hey! Is Ross still here?
joey Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
rachel Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
ross Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
rachel Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
monica Hell yeah!!!
rachel I am not gonna show you this!
phoebe No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
ross Forget it, she's destroying it.
phoebe Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
ross Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
rachel I wanna see it.
ross What?!
rachel Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
joey Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
ross I don't want people to see it for your sake.
rachel Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
ross Rachel, please
rachel Ah, a little preview!
ross Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying
rachel Okay, here we go.
ross Hello! Can I get you anything?
joey I'm so happy!
rachel Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
rachel There I am.
phoebe You're gonna get pregnant.
rachel I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I
ross You didn't do it?
rachel I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
monica Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
rachel Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
monica I know.
rachel I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh
chandler Did you do it on our invitations?!
ross Not on the ones we sent out.
chandler So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
rachel Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
ross I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost
rachel Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
ross I mean I...I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
rachel Oh I wanted to.
ross So we...we both wanted to.
rachel Interesting.
ross Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
rachel Oh yeah, sure.
rachel Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
ross And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
rachel Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
rachel Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
phoebe Oh, you came on to Ross!
rachel What?!
ross Now I'm so happy.
rachel What are you talking about?!
monica You used the Europe story!
chandler That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
rachel How do you know about that story?!
joey How do you know about that story?!
rachel I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
joey Some guy!!
rachel No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
joey Ken Adams!!
ross Hi.
rachel So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
ross Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
rachel It was an amazing night.
ross It was. It was an amazing night.
rachel You think it looked amazing?
ross I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
rachel Yeah, me neither. Yet
