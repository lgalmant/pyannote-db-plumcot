emily_waltham You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
joey_tribbiani Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?

jack_geller Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
dr_ross_geller That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
andrea_waltham Yes, Waltham interiors.
phoebe_buffay Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
andrea_waltham Who?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
andrea_waltham Oh my God, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
phoebe_buffay Hello?
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
monica_geller I know. How could we have let this happen?
chandler_bing Seven times!
monica_geller Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away
chandler_bing In a foreign, romantic country
monica_geller I blame London.
chandler_bing Bad London!
monica_geller So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
chandler_bing Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
monica_geller Only here.
chandler_bing Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
monica_geller I'll meet you there in two minutes.
chandler_bing Okay!
rachel_green Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
monica_geller Now?
rachel_green Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
monica_geller Oh, I-I don't know.
rachel_green Monica, what should I do?
monica_geller Just uh, do the right thing.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
rachel_green Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
monica_geller Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
rachel_green Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
judy_geller Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
stephen_waltham Yes.
jack_geller Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
joey_tribbiani Hey, what's up?
monica_geller Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
chandler_bing Forget it, that's off.
monica_geller Why?!
stephen_waltham The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes
monica_geller Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
joey_tribbiani Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
monica_geller That's true.
chandler_bing The man's got a point.
rachel_green Oh, hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
dr_ross_geller Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
rachel_green Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
dr_ross_geller No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you
rachel_green Right
dr_ross_geller But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
joey_tribbiani Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so
dr_ross_geller Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
joey_tribbiani You spit on me man!
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm sorry.
joey_tribbiani Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
rachel_green Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
dr_ross_geller Oh, right!
rachel_green Get the hell out of there, y'know?
dr_ross_geller Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
rachel_green Well, look at that, same thing.
chandler_bing Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
monica_geller Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
chandler_bing Oh, hello Rachel.
rachel_green Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
chandler_bing Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
monica_geller Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
chandler_bing Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
monica_geller Fifteen minutes.
rachel_green Okay.
rachel_green Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
chandler_bing Oh, yay
monica_geller Great
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hi, so what happened?
rachel_green Well, Ross said my name.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
rachel_green Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then
chandler_bing Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
monica_geller But my clothes are-ohh!
chandler_bing Wow, you look
monica_geller No time for that!
joey_tribbiani Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
chandler_bing Well, I've got a girl in here.
joey_tribbiani No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
chandler_bing Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
joey_tribbiani Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
chandler_bing Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
monica_geller Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
joey_tribbiani My Giant? I love that movie!
monica_geller You really think this is okay?
chandler_bing Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
monica_geller Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
chandler_bing Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing Okay!
dr_ross_geller Emily?!
chandler_bing Nope, not under here!
monica_geller You didn't find her?
dr_ross_geller No, I've looked everywhere!
chandler_bing Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
monica_geller Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
chandler_bing Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
monica_geller Or 45.
chandler_bing Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
dr_ross_geller No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
monica_geller Well, it's getting late.
chandler_bing Yeah, we're gonna go.
dr_ross_geller Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
monica_geller Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
chandler_bing Yeah, it's a very large plane.
dr_ross_geller That's cool.
chandler_bing But, we'll stay here with you.
dr_ross_geller Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
chandler_bing We have to leave for New York in an hour.
monica_geller I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
chandler_bing We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
dr_ross_geller Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
stephen_waltham No.
andrea_waltham You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
stephen_waltham We've come for her things.
dr_ross_geller Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
stephen_waltham She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
andrea_waltham We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
stephen_waltham Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
andrea_waltham Oh yes, there you are.
rachel_green Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside
stephen_waltham Goodbye Geller.
dr_ross_geller Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
stephen_waltham All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
andrea_waltham Call me.
stephen_waltham You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
monica_geller Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
chandler_bing Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
monica_geller I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
chandler_bing 'Kay!
joey_tribbiani Can I ask you something?
chandler_bing Uhh, no.
joey_tribbiani Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
chandler_bing No.
joey_tribbiani I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
chandler_bing Yes.
joey_tribbiani Thanks man.
chandler_bing Okay man.
joey_tribbiani But what about how much taller he is than me?
joey_tribbiani I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
joey_tribbiani Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
monica_geller I know!
joey_tribbiani Had the beef-tips, huh?
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
phoebe_buffay You ate meat! You had sex!
chandler_bing No we didn't!
phoebe_buffay I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
monica_geller Phoebe, I did not have sex.
phoebe_buffay This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
joey_tribbiani All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
phoebe_buffay Oh, me too!
joey_tribbiani Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
phoebe_buffay Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
monica_geller Well, we certainly are alone.
chandler_bing Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
monica_geller Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother
chandler_bing Right.
monica_geller Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
chandler_bing Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
monica_geller That's okay.
chandler_bing And I'm cute too.
monica_geller And you're cute too.
chandler_bing Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Bye.
chandler_bing I'm still on London time, does that count?
monica_geller That counts!
chandler_bing Oh, good!

gate_agent#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode01 This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
dr_ross_geller Pretty soon I guess.
rachel_green Yeah. I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
rachel_green No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
dr_ross_geller Same difference.
gate_agent#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode01 All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
dr_ross_geller I get it! Well, that's that.
rachel_green No, you know what, I think you should go.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know
rachel_green Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
dr_ross_geller I could, yeah, I can do that.
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
rachel_green Good!

rachel_green Right!
dr_ross_geller Right?
rachel_green Right!
dr_ross_geller Y'know-thanks!
rachel_green Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well...nah.
rachel_green What? Wait, what?
dr_ross_geller Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
rachel_green Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
rachel_green Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
dr_ross_geller Okay!

dr_ross_geller You tell them to wait!
rachel_green Okay. Wait! Wait!
dr_ross_geller Emily.
dr_ross_geller Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
rachel_green Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
