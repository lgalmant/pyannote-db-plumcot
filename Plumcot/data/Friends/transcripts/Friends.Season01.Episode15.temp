rachel Coffee.
joey Thank you.
rachel Cappuccino.
ross Grazie.
rachel And a nice hot cider for Monica.
monica Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
rachel Yeah?
monica Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
rachel Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
woman Chandler.
chandler Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
mrs_tedlock Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
chandler Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
phoebe Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
chandler Hey!
all Hey!
phoebe Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
ross What's going on?
all What is it?
chandler So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
all That's great!
chandler So.... I quit.
all Why?
chandler Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
monica Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
chandler If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
phoebe So was it a lot more money?
chandler It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
rachel .. the WENUS?
chandler Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
rachel Oh. That WENUS.
joey So what're you going to do?
chandler I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
phoebe Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
monica Um... hi there.
phoebe Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
chandler Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
phoebe Yeah, yeah!
monica Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
phoebe Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
chandler Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
phoebe OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
chandler Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
rachel No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
phoebe Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
chandler Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
rachel Career counselor?
chandler Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
rachel I don't!
chandler Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
ross Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
monica Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
phoebe Ooh! Brian's Song!
rachel The meeting with the guy went great?
monica So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
chandler Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
monica So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
rachel What are you going to make?
phoebe Yummy noises.
rachel And Monica, what are you going to make?
monica I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
phoebe Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
ross Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
joey How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
ross OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
chandler Who are you going out with?
phoebe Oh, is this the bug lady?
rachel Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
ross Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
rachel So what are you guys going to do?
ross Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
chandler And he's not speaking metaphorically.
joey So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
ross Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
joey I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
ross Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
celia I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
ross Alright...
monica OK, try this salmon mousse.
joey Mmmm. Good.
monica Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
joey It's creamier.
monica Yeah, well, is that better?
joey I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
rachel My God! What happened to you?
chandler Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
phoebe That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
chandler Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
rachel Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
monica Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
chandler Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
monica It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
chandler Well.... it is amouz-ing...
monica Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
phoebe Ten dollars an hour for what?
monica Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
rachel Waitressing?
joey Uh-oh.
monica Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
rachel But, but?
monica But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
rachel Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
chandler You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
celia Talk to me.
ross OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
celia No no no. Talk... dirty.
ross Wha... what, here?
celia Yes...
ross Ah....
celia Say something..... hot.
ross Er.... um.....
celia What?
ross Um... uh.... vulva.
joey Vulva?
ross Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
joey Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
ross Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
joey What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
ross Please be kidding.
joey Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
ross OK. I'm in my apartment...
joey ...yeah... what else?
ross That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
joey Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
ross Joey, please.
joey Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
ross Wow.
joey Alright, now you say something.
ross I... ahem... I really don't think so.
joey Come on! You like this woman, right?
ross Yeah.
joey You want to see her again, right?
ross Sure.
joey Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
ross OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
joey Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
ross Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
joey There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
ross I, er...
ross I want to take my tongue... and...
ross ...and....
joey Say it... say it!
ross ..run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
chandler ...with??
ross Funny story!
joey You're not going to believe this!
chandler It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
joey Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
chandler Again?
joey And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
chandler Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
chandler Well?
phoebe Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
chandler Look at this!
phoebe Oh! You have a window!
chandler Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
phoebe Oh look! That guy's peeing!
chandler OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
phoebe OK.
chandler This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
chandler Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
chandler Last time I do that, I promise.
monica Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
rachel Who was that?
monica Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
rachel Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
monica Ten dollars an hour.
rachel No.
monica Twelve dollars an hour.
rachel Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
monica You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
rachel Done.
rachel Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
monica Hi Steve!
steve Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
monica This is Rachel.
steve Yeah, OK.
phoebe Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
steve It's a lovely apartment.
monica Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
steve I was just being polite, but, alright.
rachel What's up?
phoebe In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
rachel What?
phoebe Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
rachel OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
steve Is it dry in here?
rachel Let me, let me get you some wine!
monica Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce..... with just a touch of mints... and..... ginger.
steve Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
monica I'm so glad you liked them!
steve Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
monica Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
steve Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
rachel Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
steve You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
steve Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
monica You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
steve Hey! Sugar-O's!
monica You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
steve Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
monica No, we don't.
steve Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
monica Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
steve No.
monica Give them to me.
steve Alright, we'll share.
monica No, give me the...
steve Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
monica That's it! Dinner is over!
steve What?
monica What?
steve Why?
monica Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
steve Hey!
joey What a tool!
rachel You don't want to work for a guy like that.
ross Yeah!
monica I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
ross Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
phoebe Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
joey So, er... how did it go with Celia?
ross Oh, I was unbelievable.
joey All right, Ross!
ross I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
joey Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
ross Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
joey You cuddled.
ross Yeah, which was nice.
phoebe You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
rachel Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
joey Yeah, where the hell is he?
chandler Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
phoebe How's this?
steve Eeeee!
phoebe Sorry. How about over here?
steve Aaaaah!
phoebe See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
steve No.
phoebe What about this?
steve Aaaaahhh!!
phoebe There you go!
