rachel_green So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
monica_geller This bottle opener.
rachel_green And?
monica_geller And it's a magnet!
rachel_green Look at that!
dr_ross_geller How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller You complete me kitchen, matey!
phoebe_buffay Ross, I know what you're thinking.
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
dr_ross_geller Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
phoebe_buffay What?!!
dr_ross_geller Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
phoebe_buffay No!
dr_ross_geller Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
monica_geller Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
rachel_green No-no, I bought those.
monica_geller Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller That you're a liar.
dr_ross_geller No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
monica_geller Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
dr_ross_geller Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
rachel_green Well, who wouldn't?!
dr_ross_geller I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
phoebe_buffay Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
rachel_green And Mrs.?!
phoebe_buffay Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
rachel_green What?!!
phoebe_buffay Just kidding!
rachel_green Ohh! Oh God!
phoebe_buffay Saved your ass.
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hi.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Oh, what's the matter?
phoebe_buffay Well, you know that psychic I see?
chandler_bing Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
chandler_bing What?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
monica_geller Phoebe that's crazy!
joey_tribbiani I can't believe she would say that too you.
rachel_green Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
phoebe_buffay I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
chandler_bing Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
phoebe_buffay No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now!
dr_ross_geller Hey everyone!
chandler_bing Oh hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
all@ Oh that'd be great. Sure!
dr_ross_geller "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
dr_ross_geller "...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
joey_tribbiani Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
dr_ross_geller No! Why?
joey_tribbiani Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
dr_ross_geller Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
chandler_bing Why don't you open with a joke?
dr_ross_geller Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
chandler_bing Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
dr_ross_geller Okay!
all@ Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
rachel_green Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
rachel_green Some uh, some visual aides.
joey_tribbiani Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
dr_ross_geller Please don't say naked chicks.
joey_tribbiani Why not?!
dr_ross_geller I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
chandler_bing That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Any good mail?
chandler_bing Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
chandler_bing "Benefits lapsed."
joey_tribbiani Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
chandler_bing Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
joey_tribbiani Let me see that!
chandler_bing All right.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
chandler_bing I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
joey_tribbiani All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
chandler_bing Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
joey_tribbiani ...look both ways before you cross the street.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
rachel_green Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
rachel_green Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
rachel_green Monica!
monica_geller Hmm?
rachel_green Did-did you take these back?
monica_geller No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
rachel_green Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
monica_geller I loved them!
rachel_green Yeah. Nice try!
dr_ross_geller Hello!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller How'd the lecture go?
dr_ross_geller It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
rachel_green Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
dr_ross_geller I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
monica_geller That you're not funny or sexy?
dr_ross_geller That's right!
joey_tribbiani Hey Estelle, listen
estelle_leonard Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
joey_tribbiani What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
estelle_leonard Really?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
estelle_leonard Oh well, no harm, no foul.
joey_tribbiani Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
estelle_leonard All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
joey_tribbiani Why?
estelle_leonard Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
joey_tribbiani Bastard!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
chandler_bing That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
joey_tribbiani What?!
chandler_bing What's wrong with you?
joey_tribbiani Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
chandler_bing This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
joey_tribbiani No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
chandler_bing That's a hernia.
joey_tribbiani Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
rachel_green Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
monica_geller Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
rachel_green Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
dr_ross_geller Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
monica_geller What the hell are you doing?!
dr_ross_geller Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
rachel_green Yeah, and not a very good one.
dr_ross_geller Will you-will you please?
the_professor Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
the_professor Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
monica_geller Monica Gellerrr.
dr_ross_geller Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
monica_geller Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
dr_ross_geller Just please stop!
rachel_green Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
chandler_bing Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
joey_tribbiani Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
chandler_bing I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
joey_tribbiani Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay What's going on?
chandler_bing Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
joey_tribbiani Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
phoebe_buffay Hey! Maybe you'll die!
joey_tribbiani Sure, now I'm scared.
phoebe_buffay No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
phoebe_buffay No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
monica_geller Gimme 'em!
rachel_green No! They are mine!
monica_geller You stole them from me!
rachel_green You stole them from me!!
monica_geller Gimme them!
monica_geller You just wanna each take one?
rachel_green Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
dr_ross_geller Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
rachel_green Well
monica_geller Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
rachel_green Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
dr_ross_geller They're not listening too me?
rachel_green Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
dr_ross_geller Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
monica_geller I think you look fine.
casting_director_1 Whenever you're ready.
joey_tribbiani Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
casting_director_1 Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
casting_director_1 Oh my God!!
joey_tribbiani So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
casting_director_2#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode04 That's where you pick up the bag.
joey_tribbiani Exactly.
casting_director_2#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode04 No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
joey_tribbiani Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
casting_director_2#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode04 No.

rachel_green Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
russell Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
rachel_green Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
dr_ross_geller All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
the_student What's happening to your accent?
dr_ross_geller Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
rachel_green Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
dr_ross_geller Well, hello Rachel!
