monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
chandler_bing Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
monica_geller Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
chandler_bing No, it wasn't you.
monica_geller Well then who?
chandler_bing I got a maid. Yay!
monica_geller I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then
chandler_bing Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control
monica_geller Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
chandler_bing Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
monica_geller Did she really say that?
chandler_bing Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
monica_geller Fine, I can do it. Whew.
chandler_bing What's the matter?
monica_geller Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
phoebe_buffay Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
dr_ross_geller I think it's coming from your bag.
phoebe_buffay I never get calls!! Hello?
eric Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fianc√°e.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
eric Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.
phoebe_buffay Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
eric Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
phoebe_buffay Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
rachel_green Wow! What did he do?
phoebe_buffay Shhh! I'm talking.
eric Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.
phoebe_buffay Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
eric Yeah uh...okay. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.
phoebe_buffay No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
eric Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.
phoebe_buffay Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
eric Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?
phoebe_buffay I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
eric Bye.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.
dr_ross_geller So apparently I'm available for lunch.
rachel_green I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
dr_ross_geller You're moving?
rachel_green Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doin'?"
dr_ross_geller So does-does Joey know you're moving?
rachel_green Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
dr_ross_geller That's not really porn.
rachel_green Not so much.
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
rachel_green Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
dr_ross_geller Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission.
rachel_green Yeah that would really be great.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. No. No you're right.
rachel_green Shall we?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
mrs_verhoeven Yes?
dr_ross_geller Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
rachel_green And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
dr_ross_geller I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
mrs_verhoeven She didn't pass.
dr_ross_geller What?
mrs_verhoeven My mother's still alive.
dr_ross_geller Oh, thank God!
mrs_verhoeven It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
rachel_green Ahh.
mrs_verhoeven Are you close with her?
dr_ross_geller Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room.
mrs_verhoeven You speak Dutch? Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten.
dr_ross_geller Y'know I would it's just painful.
rachel_green So she's really not dead.
mrs_verhoeven No, she's hanging in there.
rachel_green Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
brenda Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where'd you get it?
monica_geller Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
brenda Okay. Uhh, I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
monica_geller I love her.
brenda I'll be back in a minute.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing See? I told you.
monica_geller She stole my jeans!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
chandler_bing So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
monica_geller Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
chandler_bing She must've been planning this for years!
monica_geller I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
chandler_bing Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
monica_geller I guess.
chandler_bing So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
monica_geller Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
chandler_bing Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
monica_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
eric Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
eric Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
eric Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just...I got so angry just looking at her......face.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Yeah.
eric I'm sorry. I just...when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
phoebe_buffay Maybe this is too weird.
eric No wait! There's only a problem when I look at you. Oh I got it! I got it.
phoebe_buffay No don't tear out your eyes!!
eric I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
eric Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
phoebe_buffay Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
dr_ross_geller Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
gunther Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, we're done.
gunther Ezel.
dr_ross_geller Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
dr_ross_geller Really?!
joey_tribbiani No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
dr_ross_geller Sweet!
joey_tribbiani All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
dr_ross_geller Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
joey_tribbiani To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
dr_ross_geller No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you're switching apartments?
dr_ross_geller It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
joey_tribbiani But Rachel has an apartment.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.
joey_tribbiani She is?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
joey_tribbiani I guess I didn't really think about it.
dr_ross_geller Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
gunther Jij hebt seks met ezels.
dr_ross_geller Damnit!
monica_geller Nice jeans!
brenda Oh thanks! I like your top.
monica_geller Oh. You're not gettin' it.
brenda What happened?!
monica_geller Oh, I fell asleep.
brenda I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
monica_geller Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
brenda All right.
monica_geller Hello.
brenda What's going on?!
monica_geller I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green How was the game?
joey_tribbiani Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.
rachel_green Oh.
joey_tribbiani Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
rachel_green Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
joey_tribbiani I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
rachel_green Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
joey_tribbiani No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?
rachel_green Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
joey_tribbiani I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
rachel_green Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
joey_tribbiani I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
rachel_green I know.
joey_tribbiani Y'know I blame Ross for this.
rachel_green I do too a little bit.
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
eric Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
phoebe_buffay No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.
eric Absolutely. I love the way you kiss.
phoebe_buffay Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
chandler_bing Hi!
monica_geller Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
chandler_bing How come?
monica_geller Because I put my head between her legs.
chandler_bing To see her pants?
monica_geller They're my pants!
chandler_bing Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
monica_geller No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
chandler_bing God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
monica_geller Fine. She's wearing my bra!
chandler_bing Oh dear God!
monica_geller My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
chandler_bing And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
monica_geller Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
chandler_bing Here's another plan...No!
monica_geller I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
chandler_bing Why?
monica_geller Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
chandler_bing I fear a jury will see it the same way!
monica_geller Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
chandler_bing You see that?
monica_geller Do you see this?
chandler_bing All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
monica_geller Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
chandler_bing You need new clothes.
dr_ross_geller Hi. How is she?
mrs_verhoeven It's not looking good.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
mrs_verhoeven That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
dr_ross_geller Oh I don't know that it would.
mrs_verhoeven Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
dr_ross_geller All right then.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
eric Welcome back!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
eric I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
phoebe_buffay Why?
eric Uh, the sex.
phoebe_buffay What sex?
eric Our sex.
phoebe_buffay We didn't have sex.
eric Well if I didn't have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
phoebe_buffay Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
eric Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
phoebe_buffay You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
eric Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
phoebe_buffay You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
eric Well I was just so excited to see you.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
eric No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
phoebe_buffay So I guess this is it.
eric Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, so do you.
brenda What are you doing?
chandler_bing I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
brenda Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
chandler_bing Brenda a bee!
brenda What?
chandler_bing Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
brenda I think I know what's going on here.
chandler_bing You do?
brenda Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
chandler_bing I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Where did you get those jeans?!
rachel_green You gave them to me!
monica_geller No I didn't!
rachel_green All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
monica_geller Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
rachel_green What bra?
monica_geller The pink one with the flowers?!
rachel_green You mean the one that you're wearing?
brenda I quit!
monica_geller Sounds about right.
rachel_green What is this?
joey_tribbiani Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
rachel_green You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
joey_tribbiani Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
rachel_green But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
joey_tribbiani I'm loud!
rachel_green It's gonna be up all night!
joey_tribbiani I'm up all night!
rachel_green It's gonna poop!
joey_tribbiani Hello!
rachel_green What about all the women you want to bring home?
joey_tribbiani Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
rachel_green Joey, are you sure?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
rachel_green I want me to stay too.
joey_tribbiani Ohh!
rachel_green Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
joey_tribbiani I know! I found it on the street.
rachel_green Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
rachel_green It's moving.
joey_tribbiani Ew.
rachel_green It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
joey_tribbiani Ooh! Ah! Okay!
dr_ross_geller Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don't care, because you got the apartment. Yes!
rachel_green Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
joey_tribbiani Isn't that great?
dr_ross_geller Ezels!!
