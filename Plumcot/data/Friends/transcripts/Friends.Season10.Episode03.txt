joey_tribbiani Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
chandler_bing What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
joey_tribbiani It's OK!
chandler_bing How can you be so confident?
joey_tribbiani Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
chandler_bing Really? Like you have a routine?
joey_tribbiani No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
chandler_bing Really?
joey_tribbiani No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
chandler_bing You mean like this?
joey_tribbiani NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.

chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey sweetie!
dr_ross_geller WOW!
chandler_bing Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
chandler_bing She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
dr_ross_geller Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
monica_geller Chandler gets pedicures!
dr_ross_geller Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
chandler_bing Why...why?
dr_ross_geller Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
chandler_bing Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
dr_ross_geller So, do you get colours or just French tips?
monica_geller There. Here's their card.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing Hey Pheebs!
monica_geller Hey Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
monica_geller I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
chandler_bing Who's Amanda?
monica_geller She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
chandler_bing Are you trying to do a British accent?
monica_geller Chandler gets pedicures!
chandler_bing Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
phoebe_buffay You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
monica_geller I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
monica_geller Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
phoebe_buffay Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
monica_geller Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
chandler_bing No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
dr_ross_geller Well... I like how you look, what are you?
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 Puerto Rican.
dr_ross_geller Two, I think a two.
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
dr_ross_geller Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 Wow, you catch on quick.
dr_ross_geller Well, I have a PhD, so...
dr_ross_geller One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
dr_ross_geller You sprayed my front twice!
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 You've never turned?
dr_ross_geller No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 Mississippi? I said count to five'!
dr_ross_geller Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.
dr_ross_geller So, how dark is it gonna get?
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 You got sprayed with two two' s and...
dr_ross_geller I'm a four?
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
dr_ross_geller Really!
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 You might wanna get back in there.
dr_ross_geller Ok!
dr_ross_geller Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
assistant#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode03 You got two more twos?

joey_tribbiani I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
rachel_green So.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
rachel_green I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
joey_tribbiani What's the matter?
rachel_green I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!
joey_tribbiani@rachel_green Okay
rachel_green Ok, so sorry.
rachel_green I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!
joey_tribbiani I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
rachel_green Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
joey_tribbiani Ok.
joey_tribbiani Uh, was that good for you?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
monica_geller It could be Amanda!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
amanda_buffamonteezi Hello Monica. It's Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
monica_geller You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!

monica_geller We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
chandler_bing I get pedicures!
monica_geller Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
phoebe_buffay Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
monica_geller Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
phoebe_buffay Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
monica_geller And you would?
phoebe_buffay I did!
rachel_green Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
joey_tribbiani Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
rachel_green Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
joey_tribbiani Ok, yeah, got it.
joey_tribbiani@rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani This thing welded shut?!
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
rachel_green Oh!
rachel_green Ow!
joey_tribbiani Sorry!
rachel_green Well this is romantic!
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
rachel_green It's a standard issue bra clasp!
joey_tribbiani Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
rachel_green Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
joey_tribbiani NAH! I don't have another level!!
chandler_bing Hold on! There is something different.
dr_ross_geller I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
chandler_bing Was that place... The Sun?
dr_ross_geller Oh! And it gets worse!
chandler_bing Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
monica_geller How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
dr_ross_geller How do you count to five?
monica_geller One Two Three...
dr_ross_geller Damnit!
rachel_green oooh! Oh oh!
dr_ross_geller I Know!
rachel_green oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
chandler_bing How was your date with Joey?
rachel_green Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
chandler_bing You didn't like that?
rachel_green Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
monica_geller Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
rachel_green I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
monica_geller Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
rachel_green Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
joey_tribbiani Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second
rachel_green No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through
monica_geller Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
chandler_bing You don't know!
monica_geller Hey Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Is Amanda here yet?
phoebe_buffay No.
monica_geller Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
monica_geller Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding, I love it!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
monica_geller Hi!
amanda_buffamonteezi Hi!
amanda_buffamonteezi Hello!
amanda_buffamonteezi It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
monica_geller Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
amanda_buffamonteezi Smell my neck! It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
phoebe_buffay Musty!
amanda_buffamonteezi Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
monica_geller When were we not friends?
amanda_buffamonteezi Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel
monica_geller Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
amanda_buffamonteezi No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
monica_geller You were going to cut me out?
phoebe_buffay Well...kinda.
monica_geller Oh My God!
amanda_buffamonteezi Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
phoebe_buffay Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
monica_geller Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
monica_geller Nope!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey! Got champagne?
joey_tribbiani Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
rachel_green Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through..
joey_tribbiani Uh!
rachel_green Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
joey_tribbiani Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
rachel_green Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
joey_tribbiani Oh! yeah!
rachel_green You like that? Let's take this into high gear
joey_tribbiani uh uh!
rachel_green Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
joey_tribbiani No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
rachel_green What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
joey_tribbiani Soldier down!
monica_geller We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
chandler_bing If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
phoebe_buffay Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
monica_geller I have nothing to say to you.
amanda_buffamonteezi Wow, my flat is twice this size!
phoebe_buffay Please, Monica? In the hall?
amanda_buffamonteezi Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
chandler_bing Well, aren't you a treat.
monica_geller I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
phoebe_buffay It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
monica_geller I'm still all those things!
phoebe_buffay You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
monica_geller I am scrappy.
phoebe_buffay Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
monica_geller It's because I'm scrappy.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
monica_geller I won't know what I would do without you.
monica_geller Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I guess you're right.
amanda_buffamonteezi Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
glenda Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
glenda Okay...
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
dr_ross_geller Which... which... which... Which one is it?
dr_ross_geller OH! SON OF A BITCH!
rachel_green What is the matter with us?
joey_tribbiani Well, I know what's the matter with me.
rachel_green No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
chandler_bing That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
rachel_green Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
chandler_bing Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
rachel_green No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
joey_tribbiani Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
chandler_bing Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
chandler_bing I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
rachel_green Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
rachel_green Right, totally.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
rachel_green Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
joey_tribbiani That's a... pla-an.
joey_tribbiani Wow... I did not see this coming.
rachel_green I know. Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
rachel_green Hmmm... Me too...
rachel_green I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
joey_tribbiani I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
rachel_green Aah... I bet you're right.
joey_tribbiani So...
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani I love ya.
rachel_green Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, me too.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
chandler_bing Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
dr_ross_geller Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
chandler_bing I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
dr_ross_geller Really? Did you count Mississipily?
dr_ross_geller Dude, you're not tanned.
chandler_bing No, I just had to get a picture of this.
chandler_bing I see you later!
