chandler I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
ross Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
chandler It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
phoebe Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
all Yeah! Oh my God!
casey Here you go.
joey Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
casey Great!
chandler Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
joey That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
chandler Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
joey No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
chandler What?
joey Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
chandler Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
joey Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
chandler Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
joey What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
chandler Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
joey You got all that from the back of her head?
chandler All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
joey Who's Elaine?
phoebe "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
ross Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
phoebe Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
ross Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
phoebe Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
ross Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
monica Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
ross Yeah.
monica He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
phoebe I wanna hear "The Sound."
ross Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
phoebe Come on, play that funky music white boy.
monica Yeah!
ross No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
ross Okay, guys.
chandler All right! Bring it on, you
ross Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm
chandler Oh my God! Play!
monica Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
chandler Really, bitchin'!
phoebe Wow, it was so-wow!
ross Really?! I mean, really?!!
rachel Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
ross Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so
monica Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
rachel Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
phoebe What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
chandler You mean like, music?
chandler Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
chandler Come in!
kathy Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
chandler Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
kathy So is Joey around?
chandler No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
kathy I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
chandler I like it in the stern...of the boat. Hello.
joey Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
chandler What happened?
joey We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
chandler Why can't you tell her?
joey 'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
chandler Joey! Joey!!
joey Yeah?
chandler I thought your time ran out.
joey Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
chandler Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
kathy Oh.
chandler So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
kathy Oh, okay.
chandler Yeah, I think it is!
kathy So what did you do today?
chandler Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
kathy Oh, it looks great!
chandler ...and then it got canceled.
kathy Well, I could cut it.
chandler Really?! You do that?
kathy Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
chandler Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
kathy You have really great hair.
chandler Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
kathy Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
chandler What-what 'cha doin'?
kathy Checking to see if it's even.
chandler 'Kay.
kathy Looks good.
chandler Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
joey Hey dude, it's me.
chandler Hey it's Joey!
joey Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
chandler What?
joey Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
chandler Okay.
joey Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
chandler Oh yeah man. Joey.
kathy Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
chandler Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
kathy I forgot my purse.
chandler Oh.
kathy No, I really did forget my purse.
chandler No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
kathy Horrible!
chandler Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
kathy No-no-no, the kiss was good.
chandler Okay!
kathy No, but that's bad!
chandler Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
kathy What?!
chandler Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
kathy Can you really do that?
chandler I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
kathy Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you
chandler Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
kathy I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
chandler I-I think we have too.
kathy Okay. Bye.
chandler Bye. Are you still out there?
kathy No.
ross Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time
monica Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
phoebe It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
ross Thank you guys-guys-guys
monica Hey, aren't you up next?
phoebe Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
rachel Why not?
phoebe I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
monica Phoebe, Ross sucks!
rachel Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
phoebe Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
monica Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
rachel Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
phoebe You guys. You suck too.
joey Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
chandler Hang on buddy!
joey Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
chandler I sure did.
joey Why?
chandler Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
joey Well, you're amazing.
chandler Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
joey A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
chandler Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
joey Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
chandler Oh, I don't know.
joey Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
chandler You mean with Casey.
joey No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
chandler Or Casey.
joey No-no, Kathy.
chandler Could be Casey.
joey No. No, Kathy.
chandler Consider Casey.
joey Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
chandler That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
ross Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
phoebe Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
ross Pheebs
phoebe Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I
ross See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
phoebe Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
ross Yeah, okay.
ross Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
monica Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
chandler I kissed Kathy.
ross What?
monica Are you serious?
phoebe Does Joey know?
chandler No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
monica You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
ross No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
chandler Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
phoebe I think maybe, yeah.
monica He loves you.
chandler Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
ross Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
phoebe Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
rachel I know, I remember that!
monica I remember you did.
chandler God!! What am I gonna do?!
rachel Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
chandler Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
rachel Because you do.
chandler Yeah, I know.
ross Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
chandler Hey!
joey Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
chandler Is that a real thing?
joey Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
chandler Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
joey What's up?
chandler It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
joey You do?
chandler Yeah.
joey Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
chandler What?
joey Yeah, she broke up with me.
chandler Oh uh, when?
joey Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
chandler Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
joey Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
chandler Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
joey No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
chandler Yeah?
joey Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
chandler Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
joey But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So
chandler See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
joey Who?
chandler It's me. I'm the other guy.
joey What?
chandler Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
joey And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
chandler No! No! No! I just kissed her.
joey What?!! That's even worse!!
chandler How is that worse?!
joey I don't know! But it's the same!
chandler Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
joey Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
chandler You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
joey Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
chandler Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
joey Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
chandler Probably because
joey Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
phoebe Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
monica What?
rachel Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
ross Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
phoebe After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
ross Yeah, like I could lose it.
rachel What?
ross I played bad on purpose guys.
monica Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
ross Yeah-no, just that last song.
