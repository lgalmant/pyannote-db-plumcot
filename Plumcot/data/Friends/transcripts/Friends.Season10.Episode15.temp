chandler How did the job stuff go?
rachel He offered me one.
ross You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
rachel The job is in Paris.
rachel Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
ross So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
chandler Or facing a bitch of a commute.
rachel I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
ross Okay.
rachel I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
chandler My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
ross All right, we'll work it out.
rachel Thank you! Thank you!
ross Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
rachel I think it is.
phoebe Ooh, what's going on?
rachel I got a really incredible job offer.
joey Hey, great! All right!
phoebe Good for you!
rachel It's in Paris.
joey What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
monica Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
joey Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
rachel Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
phoebe Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...
joey No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
rachel Joey, it would mean so...
joey Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
rachel Joey...
phoebe You okay with this?
chandler Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
phoebe Talking to Ross.
chandler I see.
ross Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
monica I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
ross Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
monica How is that gonna happen?
chandler Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
ross I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
monica You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
ross I didn't say we were brothers.
monica Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
chandler We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
monica But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
chandler What do you think Pheebs?
phoebe Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
chandler Yeah.
phoebe She died.
chandler You're kidding!
monica That's terrible!
phoebe Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
chandler Oh yeah?
phoebe Yeah, she was just an agent.
monica Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
chandler I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
phoebe Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
monica Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
phoebe Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
monica What if he reads it in the paper?
chandler Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
ross Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
mr_zelner Oh right, uhm, Don?
ross Close. Ron.
mr_zelner Uh... What can I do for you?
ross Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
mr_zelner Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
ross Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
mr_zelner Wow, that is tempting.
ross Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it
mr_zelner She is good!
ross Huh, I took a shot there.
mr_zelner But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
ross I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
mr_zelner Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
ross Oh, nothing, itâ€™s just, itâ€™s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
mr_zelner Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
ross How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and thatâ€™s not good. Let me start again. Iâ€™m a paleontologist, youâ€™ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bonesâ€¦ fossils!
mr_zelner You can really arrange that?
ross You let Rachel come back, and itâ€™s done.
mr_zelner Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldnâ€™t be the worst thing in the world.
ross Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
mr_zelner Thatâ€™s great. I worry about little Ross. Heâ€™s always reading, he's collecting rocks and heâ€™s obsessed with dinosaurs.
ross Heâ€™ll be fine.
joey Hey Phoebe.
phoebe Hey. Everything ok?
joey Iâ€™m just mad at my agent.
phoebe Estelle? Why?
joey Thereâ€™s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didnâ€™t even be put up for it! Sheâ€™d better have a good reason.
phoebe Iâ€™m guessing she does.
joey Well Iâ€™m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
phoebe Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
joey Ok. Why?
phoebe Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
joey I love that saying!
joey Hello?
phoebe_ Joey, itâ€™s Estelle.
joey I was just gonna call you! Thatâ€™s weird.
phoebeestelle Itâ€™s a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re wondering why I didnâ€™t get you an audition for that TV movie.
joey Yeah, actually I am!
phoebeestelle I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
joey Thatâ€™s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
phoebeestelle Donâ€™t take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
joey No, no, look. All Iâ€™m saying is that youâ€™re my agent, ok? And youâ€™re not getting me into any auditions and Iâ€™m tired of it.
phoebeestelle What are you saying?
joey Iâ€™m saying thatâ€¦ . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, youâ€™re fired. Goodbye. .
phoebe Man, tough week for Estelle!
ross Hi.
rachel Hi.
ross Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she canâ€™t sleep without it.
rachel Oh, well, sheâ€™s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
ross Ok.
rachel Oh, youâ€™re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
ross Nooo!
rachel Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
ross So, youâ€™re not going to Paris.
rachel No, Iâ€™m still going.
ross Whâ€¦ whâ€¦what?
rachel When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isnâ€™t that great?
ross Yeeeah!
lady Oh, sure. Iâ€™m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
monica Thanks.
chandler It feels like weâ€™re cheating on our house. And if weâ€™re gonna cheat, shouldnâ€™t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house wonâ€™t do?
monica Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
lady So? What do you think?
monica Love it!
lady Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
monica They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
lady Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and sheâ€¦
janice Oh my God!
chandler_ Sure.
phoebe Hey Joey, want come with me toâ€¦ are you ok?
joey Yeah, I justâ€¦ I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
phoebe No, that wouldnâ€™t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
joey I donâ€™t know. Sheâ€™s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And Iâ€™m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know sheâ€™s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. Iâ€™m gonna call her and hire her again.
phoebe No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you
joey Why?
phoebe Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
joey You blow me away.
phoebe All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
joey I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
chandler And yet I never run into Beyonce!
realtor You two know each other?
janice Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie
chandler Don't, don't!
monica No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
chandler Why!?
monica I don't know why.
janice Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
chandler This can not be happening!
monica Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
chandler The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
monica Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
chandler That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
monica Okay, you come up with an idea.
chandler Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
monica But we love our house.
chandler Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
monica Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
chandler Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
r_zelner Who is it?
ross It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
mr_zelner This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
ross Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
mr_zelner Not good, Ron.
ross Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
mr_zelner Wow, that's pretty cool
ross Huh? So? We have a deal?
mr_zelner Okay, you got it.
ross Yes! yes!
mr_zelner This is gonna make me very popular.
ross Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
mr_zelner I meant with my son.
ross Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
joey Oh my God. Hello?
phoebe Joey, it's Estelle.
joey Estelle?
phoebe Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
joey Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
phoebe Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
joey No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!
phoebe Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
joey Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
phoebe It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
joey Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
chandler The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
janice All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
chandler Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
janice Oh, me too...
chandler Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
janice Huh?
chandler I never stopped loving you.
janice Oh... my...
chandler Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
janice Chandler, what are you talking about?
chandler Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
janice I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.
chandler Obviously.
janice But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
chandler Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
janice Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
chandler I understand.
janice Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing.
chandler They're never coming down now.
rachel Hi!
ross Hey!
rachel You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
ross What?
rachel Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
ross They did?
rachel Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
ross So, what are you gonna do?
rachel Well, I took it.
ross That's great! So you're staying in New York!
both YAY! WHOO! YAY!
ross You're excited, right?
rachel Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
ross Right!
rachel Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
ross Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
rachel Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
ross You should go.
rachel What?
ross It's what you want. You should go.
rachel You really think so?
ross I really do.
rachel But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
ross I'm sure he'll understand.
rachel All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
ross Yeah...
rachel Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
ross Yeah, yeah, oh!
rachel Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
ross Then I'm happy too.
joey Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
