rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
chandler_bing Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay What?!
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Monday?!
joey_tribbiani How long do you have to go for?
chandler_bing They said it could be up to a year.
joey_tribbiani A year?!
rachel_green Do you have to go?
monica_geller I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing
chandler_bing There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
chandler_bing I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
joey_tribbiani We were gonna go see the Jets!
dr_ross_geller You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
chandler_bing Really?
dr_ross_geller Not you.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you guys are moving.
phoebe_buffay I call their apartment!!!
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode03 No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
joey_tribbiani Here you are
rachel_green Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
dr_ross_geller I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
rachel_green Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
rachel_green Every time?
joey_tribbiani Uhuh.
dr_ross_geller Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
rachel_green All right, I trust you.
dr_ross_geller Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
rachel_green I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
phoebe_buffay It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
joey_tribbiani I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
phoebe_buffay Look at you all grown up.
joey_tribbiani Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
phoebe_buffay You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
joey_tribbiani I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
phoebe_buffay Done. Oh good, really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
joey_tribbiani Poophack...
phoebe_buffay Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing I've got good news!
monica_geller You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
chandler_bing Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
monica_geller It's great! How?
monica_geller So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
monica_geller No. I can't be away from you for that long.
chandler_bing Really?
monica_geller Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
chandler_bing That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
monica_geller Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
chandler_bing Hey, you said that without gagging!
monica_geller I know!
rachel_green Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
dr_ross_geller Who the hell was that?!
rachel_green Dr. Wiener.
dr_ross_geller Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
rachel_green Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
dr_ross_geller Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
rachel_green Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
dr_ross_geller Well, what was it?
rachel_green Hiccups.
dr_ross_geller Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
rachel_green Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
dr_ross_geller Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
rachel_green Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
dr_ross_geller Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
rachel_green What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
dr_ross_geller You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
rachel_green Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
dr_ross_geller Rachel!!!
rachel_green Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay So how is this for our big double date tonight?
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
phoebe_buffay Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay Come on, give me something. What's his name?
joey_tribbiani Mike.
phoebe_buffay Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
joey_tribbiani Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
phoebe_buffay All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
joey_tribbiani Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
rachel_green It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
monica_geller Excuse me?
chandler_bing I know what she's talking about.
rachel_green We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
monica_geller Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
rachel_green Ross said he died.
monica_geller He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
rachel_green Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
monica_geller Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
chandler_bing He saw a therapist?
monica_geller Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
rachel_green Why? What was it?
monica_geller That I was going to eat him.
joey_tribbiani MIKE!!!
mike_hannigan Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Okay!
mike_hannigan I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.
joey_tribbiani Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
mike_hannigan I am Mike.
joey_tribbiani Atta boy!
joey_tribbiani Okay, look...
phoebe_buffay Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
mike_hannigan How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
joey_tribbiani From school.
mike_hannigan Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school.
phoebe_buffay Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
mike_hannigan Well, I'm a lawyer.
joey_tribbiani Mike, 'attorney at law'!
mike_hannigan Actually, I just gave up my practice.
joey_tribbiani What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
mike_hannigan I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
phoebe_buffay Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
joey_tribbiani Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
mary_ellen_jenkins I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
joey_tribbiani No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
monica_geller That's so sweet. Find anything?
chandler_bing Slim Pickings.
monica_geller Nothing, huh?
chandler_bing No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
monica_geller 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
chandler_bing 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
monica_geller Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
chandler_bing Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
monica_geller Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
rachel_green Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
the_receptionist Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.
dr_gettleman I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.
dr_ross_geller Thanks doctor.
dr_gettleman Would you like a lollypop?
dr_ross_geller You even have to ask?! He is alive!
phoebe_buffay You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
mike_hannigan No, I didn't.
joey_tribbiani That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
joey_tribbiani Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
mary_ellen_jenkins Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
mike_hannigan 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
phoebe_buffay What?!
mike_hannigan What?!
joey_tribbiani What?!
phoebe_buffay Do you not know each other?
joey_tribbiani Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
phoebe_buffay Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
mike_hannigan Six!
joey_tribbiani What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
phoebe_buffay Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
joey_tribbiani Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
mike_hannigan I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
phoebe_buffay You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
mary_ellen_jenkins Hey!
phoebe_buffay Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
joey_tribbiani Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!
phoebe_buffay I'm out of here
mike_hannigan It was nice meeting you!
joey_tribbiani You're leaving too?
mary_ellen_jenkins I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
joey_tribbiani Good night!
chandler_bing Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
monica_geller You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
chandler_bing How far outside?
monica_geller Manhattan.
chandler_bing And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
monica_geller I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
chandler_bing What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
monica_geller Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
chandler_bing I think you should take the job.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
monica_geller That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller How was the pediatrician?
rachel_green Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
dr_ross_geller You promised you wouldn't say anything.
rachel_green I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
monica_geller Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
dr_ross_geller He's a brilliant diagnostician!
chandler_bing Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
rachel_green Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
dr_ross_geller Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
chandler_bing Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
chandler_bing That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
dr_ross_geller It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
mike_hannigan Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?
phoebe_buffay Sure.
mike_hannigan I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.
phoebe_buffay Why did you go along with that?
mike_hannigan Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
phoebe_buffay That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
mike_hannigan My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
phoebe_buffay Prove it.
mike_hannigan There isn't a piano here.
phoebe_buffay That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
phoebe_buffay You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
mike_hannigan Really?
phoebe_buffay Uhuh.
mike_hannigan That's great. What kind of music do you play?
phoebe_buffay Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
mike_hannigan Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
phoebe_buffay It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
mike_hannigan Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
phoebe_buffay Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
joey_tribbiani Look at this. My two best friends!
dr_ross_geller Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
the_receptionist The doctor will be right with you sir.
girl#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode03 Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
dr_ross_geller With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode03 Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
sally Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
dr_ross_geller I am a single parent.
sally It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
dr_ross_geller Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
the_nurse Rossy, we're ready for you.
dr_ross_geller Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
the_boy_in_the_doctors_office Mommy
girl#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode03 Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
dr_ross_geller Oh good, you haven't left yet.
monica_geller Where have you been?
dr_ross_geller I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
chandler_bing Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
dr_ross_geller Oh man.
monica_geller Promise to call me when you land.
chandler_bing Of course I will call you. I love you.
monica_geller I love you too.
rachel_green Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
phoebe_buffay Bye Chandler.
chandler_bing Awww. Bye!
rachel_green Bye honey.
chandler_bing What's the matter Joe?
joey_tribbiani I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
chandler_bing Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
joey_tribbiani Dude, you see right thru me!!
chandler_bing Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
phoebe_buffay Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
monica_geller Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do.
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller I love you so much.
chandler_bing I know that too.
chandler_bing Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
joey_tribbiani Double promise? Call me when you land.
monica_geller Can I talk now?
joey_tribbiani Okay, bye.
monica_geller Joey?
joey_tribbiani He had to board.
