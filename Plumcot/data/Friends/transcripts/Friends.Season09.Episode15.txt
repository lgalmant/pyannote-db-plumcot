chandler_bing Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what...
joey_tribbiani Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
monica_geller Really? Let's get past the moment.
phoebe_buffay What's your news?
chandler_bing Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
monica_geller Oh, honey, that's incredible!
phoebe_buffay Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
chandler_bing Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
joey_tribbiani Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
chandler_bing Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
chandler_bing Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
phoebe_buffay That's great.
chandler_bing Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
chandler_bing Humiliating and noble!
dr_ross_geller You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
monica_geller Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
dr_ross_geller Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.. and I smelled bacon.
monica_geller He just left.
joey_tribbiani Who did?
rachel_green Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
joey_tribbiani She did?
rachel_green You got it!
joey_tribbiani I did?
monica_geller What is she talking about?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, but it sounds great.
rachel_green Your agent called. You got that audition.
joey_tribbiani With Lennart Haze?
rachel_green Yes.
joey_tribbiani Oh my god, that is great! That is ''' for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
monica_geller Is it a good play?
joey_tribbiani Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.
rachel_green Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it...
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, and directing.
monica_geller He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
rachel_green You saw that?
monica_geller No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
joey_tribbiani@rachel_green Ah!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
rachel_green Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
joey_tribbiani I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
monica_geller Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
joey_tribbiani Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
chandler_bing Good morning, everybody.
intern#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
chandler_bing Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
intern#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Seriously, you're an intern?
chandler_bing Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
intern#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Dude!
chandler_bing Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope
chandler_bing The comedian? USO?!
intern#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Uhm, it's USA, sir.
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.
joey_tribbiani It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
leonard_hayes Well, I've... I've been blessed with a... a lot of great roles.
joey_tribbiani Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"
leonard_hayes You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
joey_tribbiani No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
leonard_hayes Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
leonard_hayes Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.
joey_tribbiani Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon...
leonard_hayes Peeeeeooooooooch "Hang up that phone!" One take!
joey_tribbiani Wow!
leonard_hayes So, shall we read?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yah, sure.
leonard_hayes Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?
leonard_hayes "What the hell are you still doing here"?
joey_tribbiani Err, "I think you know".
leonard_hayes "Bastard"!
joey_tribbiani "I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
leonard_hayes "Go, go!"
joey_tribbiani "I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
leonard_hayes I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"
joey_tribbiani Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...
leonard_hayes No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.
joey_tribbiani Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern "I could go right now, maaan!"
leonard_hayes My god in heaven.
producer_1#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?
leonard_hayes You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act.
leonard_hayes Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.
joey_tribbiani Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
leonard_hayes Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
leonard_hayes Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.
joey_tribbiani I really doubt that.
leonard_hayes No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.
joey_tribbiani Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
phoebe_buffay Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I hear divorce bells.
mugger#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
dr_ross_geller What?
mugger#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 I have a gun
dr_ross_geller O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
mugger#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
phoebe_buffay No.
dr_ross_geller What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe_buffay Lowell, is that you?
lowell Phoebe? Oh my god!
phoebe_buffay Oh my god!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
lowell Ross, nice to meet you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, a real pleasure.
phoebe_buffay Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
lowell Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
phoebe_buffay Good for you!
lowell So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
phoebe_buffay Ouh...
dr_ross_geller Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
phoebe_buffay Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up...
monica_geller Hey, how did the audition go?
joey_tribbiani Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
monica_geller What happened?
joey_tribbiani Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
monica_geller So far so good!
chandler_bing Honey, I'm old!
monica_geller What's wrong?
chandler_bing I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
monica_geller So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
chandler_bing Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
joey_tribbiani Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
monica_geller What are they?
chandler_bing They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
joey_tribbiani I give you $ 500 for them!
chandler_bing What am I supposed to do with these?
monica_geller Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
chandler_bing Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
monica_geller Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
chandler_bing No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
joey_tribbiani Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
all@ Hey, hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
monica_geller You okay?!
dr_ross_geller Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
monica_geller How do you know a mugger?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
dr_ross_geller You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.
monica_geller Seriously?
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I...
monica_geller Phoebe, that is awful!
phoebe_buffay Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer...
monica_geller You're mother killed herself!
phoebe_buffay She was a drug dealer!
dr_ross_geller Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!
phoebe_buffay Okay...
monica_geller Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
phoebe_buffay Why?
monica_geller Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
phoebe_buffay You were?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
monica_geller Wonderwoman!
dr_ross_geller Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone.... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"
phoebe_buffay Oh my god...
dr_ross_geller I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
monica_geller Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
dr_ross_geller A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
monica_geller That's it.
dr_ross_geller Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I think we have a problem here.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
monica_geller Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
monica_geller So?
phoebe_buffay Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay "Geology rocks!"
monica_geller Oh my god!
phoebe_buffay I know... I mugged Ross!
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 You're late!
joey_tribbiani I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 No, Lennart doesn't wait!
joey_tribbiani But I'm bursting with u-hu!
leonard_hayes Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
joey_tribbiani Actually, I really need...
leonard_hayes We must go now, quickly, please.
joey_tribbiani Yes... ahahaaa
leonard_hayes Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"
joey_tribbiani "I think you know!"
leonard_hayes "Oh, you sick bastard!"
joey_tribbiani "I am what you made me! You know what?"
leonard_hayes "What?"
joey_tribbiani "I could go right now."
leonard_hayes "Then go, go!"
joey_tribbiani "I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
leonard_hayes Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
joey_tribbiani I did?
leonard_hayes Yes. Plus... what you've got that... I don't know what you've got going... this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ''', do all of this what you've got going now, but - you know what? - more, more. Can you do that?
joey_tribbiani Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
leonard_hayes Look at that: still in character, I like it... I plant seeds I can't explain.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything...
rachel_green Oh, anything yet?
chandler_bing Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
all@ Hey!
joey_tribbiani Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
monica_geller No, that seems about right.
joey_tribbiani Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
rachel_green Joey, that was formula.
joey_tribbiani We gotta get more of that.
chandler_bing You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
rachel_green Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
chandler_bing Alright I feel youger already!
chandler_bing Yah, I think I broke my hip.
phoebe_buffay Hey, you!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey, how was class?
dr_ross_geller No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
phoebe_buffay Nothing, I really wanna know.
dr_ross_geller Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene...
phoebe_buffay Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid...
dr_ross_geller Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
phoebe_buffay You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
dr_ross_geller No, it wasn't.
phoebe_buffay Yes, it was.
dr_ross_geller No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old...
phoebe_buffay "Gimme your money, punk!"
dr_ross_geller Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!
dr_ross_geller It's not the best!
phoebe_buffay I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say...
dr_ross_geller There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
phoebe_buffay Really? Even more humiliating than...
dr_ross_geller Hey, let's not do this!
intern#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 .. and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!
the_casting_director That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander...
chandler_bing Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age...
intern#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode15 Your age?
chandler_bing A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
the_casting_director Chandler, that's great!
chandler_bing Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me
the_casting_director You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's.... You did you come up with that?
chandler_bing I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
the_casting_director That is great. Good work!
the_casting_director See all of you tomorrow.
chandler_bing The cold weather hurts my hip!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
dr_ross_geller Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
phoebe_buffay I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
dr_ross_geller Oh my god, crap from the street?
phoebe_buffay Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
dr_ross_geller Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
phoebe_buffay I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
dr_ross_geller You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
phoebe_buffay Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
dr_ross_geller Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him
dr_ross_geller You're welcome.
joey_tribbiani "I need an answer!"
leonard_hayes "I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
joey_tribbiani "You know!"
leonard_hayes "I don't know!"
joey_tribbiani "I need an answer now!"
leonard_hayes "Alright, here, you want an answer... the answer... is..."
joey_tribbiani Oh!
leonard_hayes "She never loved me, she only loved you."
leonard_hayes Absolutely amazing! The part is yours.
joey_tribbiani Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get...
leonard_hayes Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
monica_geller Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
dr_ross_geller Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that...
monica_geller .. that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
dr_ross_geller I see. You didn't happen to tell...
monica_geller .. everybody we know? Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Great. Thanks!
