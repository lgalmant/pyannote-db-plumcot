monica_geller Erica, are you okay?
erica Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
monica_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
monica_geller She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
rachel_green So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
dr_ross_geller Rach!
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
dr_ross_geller Oh. This was amazing.
rachel_green It really was. You've learned some new moves!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
rachel_green Ah.
dr_ross_geller Who's laughing now?
rachel_green I know!
monica_geller Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
chandler_bing Next time, can I say breathe?
monica_geller No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
erica No, I'm okay.
monica_geller Alright, I'll be right back.
chandler_bing Where are you going?
monica_geller To use the bathroom.
chandler_bing You can't leave me alone with her.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
monica_geller What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
chandler_bing It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
monica_geller You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
chandler_bing Okay.
chandler_bing So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
erica I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
chandler_bing Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
erica What?
chandler_bing Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
chandler_bing One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
phoebe_buffay Morning.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay What's that?
joey_tribbiani It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
phoebe_buffay It's a baby chick and duck!
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
phoebe_buffay I did not see that coming.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
phoebe_buffay Yes.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
phoebe_buffay That is the rule, though.
phoebe_buffay Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
phoebe_buffay Have you seen him throw a ball?
dr_ross_geller Is Rachel here?
joey_tribbiani Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
dr_ross_geller Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
phoebe_buffay What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God. You and Rachel?
dr_ross_geller I know, it's pretty great.
joey_tribbiani So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
phoebe_buffay But do you wanna get back together?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
phoebe_buffay YAY!
dr_ross_geller Shhh!
phoebe_buffay Yay!
joey_tribbiani So, so is she still going to Paris?
dr_ross_geller Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
rachel_green Morning!
phoebe_buffay Guess we'll never know how it ends.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey. How did you sleep?
rachel_green Good. You?
dr_ross_geller Good.
joey_tribbiani I bet you did!
dr_ross_geller Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
joey_tribbiani Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
rachel_green Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
phoebe_buffay Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
dr_ross_geller So...
dr_ross_geller Morning.
rachel_green You too. Last night was just wonderful.
dr_ross_geller It really was.
rachel_green I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
dr_ross_geller I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
rachel_green Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
monica_geller It's just a little bit more, honey.
erica Help me! This hurts!
chandler_bing Is it really that bad?
erica Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
the_doctor The baby's head is crowning.
monica_geller Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
chandler_bing I'm okay.
monica_geller Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
chandler_bing Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
the_doctor Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
monica_geller It's a... It's a boy!
chandler_bing Wow!
erica Is he okay?
the_doctor He's just fine.
monica_geller Oh, you did it!
chandler_bing It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
the_doctor Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
chandler_bing Well, that's spongy.
monica_geller Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
chandler_bing I know. He has your eyes.
chandler_bing I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
nurse We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
erica I'm really happy for you guys.
chandler_bing How do you feel?
erica I'm tired!
the_doctor Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
monica_geller I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
the_doctor The next baby should be along in a minute.
monica_geller We only ordered one!
the_doctor You know it's twins, right?
chandler_bing Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
the_doctor I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
chandler_bing Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
monica_geller Wait, did you know it was twins?
the_doctor Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
monica_geller Anybody tell you?
erica I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
monica_geller This is unbelievable.
erica Twins actually run in my family.
chandler_bing Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
chandler_bing What do we do?
monica_geller What do you mean "what do we do"?
chandler_bing Twins! Twins!!
monica_geller Chandler, you're panicking!
chandler_bing Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
monica_geller We can't split them up!
chandler_bing Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
monica_geller Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
chandler_bing What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
monica_geller Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
chandler_bing Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
monica_geller That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
chandler_bing Okay. Shhh...
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing Okay!
the_doctor It looks like we're about ready over here.
the_doctor Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
erica Ow!
the_doctor Here she comes!
chandler_bing She? It's a girl?
the_doctor Yeah.
chandler_bing Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
dr_ross_geller And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! What did you say?
dr_ross_geller Nothing! What do you say to that?
phoebe_buffay Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
dr_ross_geller No way!
joey_tribbiani You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
phoebe_buffay Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
dr_ross_geller You really think so?
phoebe_buffay I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Can't a girl finish a song around here?
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
rachel_green No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
phoebe_buffay Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
rachel_green Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
dr_ross_geller Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
joey_tribbiani Ross, wait!
dr_ross_geller What? What?
joey_tribbiani Could you get me a muffin?
gunther Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah?
gunther I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
gunther I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
rachel_green Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
rachel_green Oh... Bye guys.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Unbelievable!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you know what might help?
dr_ross_geller I'm not getting you a muffin!
monica_geller Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
chandler_bing Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
nurse We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
monica_geller There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
erica Oh my God, that's just like my name!
monica_geller Son of a gun, it is!
erica Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
monica_geller Okay, well, bye!
erica Bye!
chandler_bing Bye!
monica_geller We'll call you!
erica Okay.
chandler_bing Have fun at church-camp!
monica_geller Oh, look at these little bunnies!
chandler_bing I know! You ready to trade?
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Alright, let's see..
chandler_bing We could trade later.
monica_geller Yeah, I'm good.
phoebe_buffay Hey, what are you working on?
joey_tribbiani It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
phoebe_buffay How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
joey_tribbiani No, I sat in the paint.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
dr_ross_geller No, and I'm not going to.
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani Why not?
dr_ross_geller Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
phoebe_buffay How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
phoebe_buffay Uh, Joe?
joey_tribbiani Damn it!
dr_ross_geller Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
phoebe_buffay No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
mike_hannigan Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! What do you have there?
mike_hannigan Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! You did that yourself?
phoebe_buffay Honey, that's gorgeous!
joey_tribbiani You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
rachel_green Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
joey_tribbiani Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
rachel_green Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
rachel_green Hi! Oh my gosh!
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller@phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey, so what is the big surprise?
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
rachel_green What... What...
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
monica_geller Yes, it's twins!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God.
joey_tribbiani Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
monica_geller This is a boy, and that's a girl.
chandler_bing Her name is Erica.
rachel_green Aw..
joey_tribbiani Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
chandler_bing Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
monica_geller Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
dr_ross_geller Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
rachel_green Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
mike_hannigan I want one.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
mike_hannigan Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
phoebe_buffay One? How about a whole bunch?
mike_hannigan Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
rachel_green Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
monica_geller I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
rachel_green Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
monica_geller I love you.
chandler_bing I love you.
monica_geller Call us when you get there.
rachel_green I will. Ross, come here.
rachel_green I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
dr_ross_geller Neither will I.
rachel_green Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
phoebe_buffay So, you just let her go?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey, maybe that's for the best.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
phoebe_buffay But now she'll never know how he feels!
joey_tribbiani Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
joey_tribbiani Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller I don't! I wanna be with her.
joey_tribbiani Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you are!
phoebe_buffay Woo!
phoebe_buffay Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
dr_ross_geller My coat...
joey_tribbiani This is so cool!
chandler_bing I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
joey_tribbiani But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
phoebe_buffay You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
dr_ross_geller Okay, guys, wish me luck.
phoebe_buffay Hurry!
joey_tribbiani Good luck, good luck!
dr_ross_geller There's no seatbelt!
phoebe_buffay That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
dr_ross_geller Alright, alright, let's do this!
phoebe_buffay Okay!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
man_in_cab 18th and East End.
phoebe_buffay I - I don't take passengers.
man_in_cab Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
dr_ross_geller No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
man_in_cab Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
phoebe_buffay My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
man_in_cab What?
dr_ross_geller Get out of the cab!
phoebe_buffay Get out of the cab!
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
monica_geller Now, that you can do.
joey_tribbiani Alright!
joey_tribbiani Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
phoebe_buffay You can open your eyes now.
dr_ross_geller Are we off the bridge?
phoebe_buffay Yes.
dr_ross_geller Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
phoebe_buffay Yes, she jumped right back up.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
phoebe_buffay Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
dr_ross_geller Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
phoebe_buffay You should have thought of that before you got in!
phoebe_buffay Toll-booth.
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
phoebe_buffay Hurry!
dr_ross_geller Okay!
phoebe_buffay Okay.
phoebe_buffay Damn, that window is clean.
joey_tribbiani Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
chandler_bing We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
joey_tribbiani Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
chandler_bing Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
monica_geller Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
chandler_bing Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
monica_geller Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
chandler_bing Alright.
monica_geller Oh God! What did I just step on?
joey_tribbiani Oh!
chandler_bing It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
monica_geller Oh..
joey_tribbiani You stepped on my egg roll?
monica_geller I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
joey_tribbiani Just put it on a plate and leave.
chandler_bing Okay, let's find these birds.
joey_tribbiani Alright.
joey_tribbiani Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
joey_tribbiani Oh! They're in the table!
chandler_bing Well, that can't be good!
joey_tribbiani We gotta get them out of there!
chandler_bing How?
joey_tribbiani Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
chandler_bing Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
joey_tribbiani Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
chandler_bing Joey, wait! The ball!
joey_tribbiani Oh!
joey_tribbiani Oh God! So what do we do?
chandler_bing I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
chandler_bing No... It's all glued together.
joey_tribbiani Does that mean we have to bust it open?
chandler_bing I don't know. Maybe.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
chandler_bing I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
joey_tribbiani All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
chandler_bing Did that movie ever get made?
joey_tribbiani It did not.
phoebe_buffay Ross, where are you going?
dr_ross_geller To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
phoebe_buffay What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
dr_ross_geller Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
phoebe_buffay You have to get a ticket to get past security.
dr_ross_geller What? We're never gonna make it!
phoebe_buffay Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
dr_ross_geller Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
gate_attendant_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Madame, your passport please?
rachel_green Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
gate_attendant_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Your boarding pass, please.
rachel_green Oh.
rachel_green Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
gate_attendant_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
rachel_green I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
gate_attendant_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
rachel_green Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I need a ticket.
phoebe_buffay Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
dr_ross_geller Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
phoebe_buffay We're on our honeymoon.
ticket_agent And the destination?
dr_ross_geller I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
phoebe_buffay I'm so lucky I married you.
rachel_green Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
rachel_green Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
dr_ross_geller Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
phoebe_buffay No, did we miss it?
dr_ross_geller No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
phoebe_buffay Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
monica_geller Hello.
phoebe_buffay Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
dr_ross_geller What? Hey, hey, listen..
monica_geller Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
dr_ross_geller Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
dr_ross_geller That's alright. Listen, listen.
monica_geller Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
dr_ross_geller Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
monica_geller Isn't that cute?
dr_ross_geller That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
monica_geller Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
dr_ross_geller Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
monica_geller That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller Newark airport. Why, where are you?
dr_ross_geller JFK.
joey_tribbiani Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
chandler_bing And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Here goes.
chandler_bing What's the matter?
joey_tribbiani I need to say goodbye to the table first.
chandler_bing I understand.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
chandler_bing I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
joey_tribbiani Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
chandler_bing Well, I can't do it either.
monica_geller Hey! Did you find them?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
chandler_bing We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
monica_geller Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
phoebe_buffay Well, I've never gone this fast before.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
phoebe_buffay She's got her cell, you could call her.
dr_ross_geller I am not doing this over the phone.
phoebe_buffay You don't have any other choice!
rachel_green Hello?
phoebe_buffay Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
dr_ross_geller Yay.
phoebe_buffay Uh, Rach, hang on.
rachel_green Phoebe? Is everything okay?
phoebe_buffay Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
rachel_green What? Why?
phoebe_buffay I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
rachel_green Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
rachel_green Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Uhm, what was that?
rachel_green Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Okay, that doesn't sound good.
rachel_green I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 But she is sometimes.
rachel_green Well...
rachel_green Wait, what are you doing?
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Well, I can't take this plane now.
airline_representative Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
rachel_green Could I get some peanuts?
passenger_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 What's wrong with the plane?
airline_representative There's nothing wrong with the plane.
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Yeah! The left Philange!
airline_representative There is no Philange!
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
passenger_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 I'm not flying on it!
airline_representative Ma'am, please sit down!
passenger_3#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 What's going on?
passenger_1#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
rachel_green This is ridiculous! I...
rachel_green Yeah, okay.
monica_geller Alright. My job here is done.
chandler_bing That was... Impressive.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
monica_geller Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
chandler_bing Sorry about the table, man.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing You gonna buy a new one?
joey_tribbiani Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
chandler_bing Well, at least we got these little guys out.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
chandler_bing Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
joey_tribbiani I could get a goose!
chandler_bing You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
joey_tribbiani Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
chandler_bing I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
joey_tribbiani Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
gate_attendant_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
passenger_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 And you fixed the Philange?
gate_attendant_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
dr_ross_geller Where is she?
phoebe_buffay I don't see her.
dr_ross_geller Rachel! Rachel Green!
phoebe_buffay There she is!
dr_ross_geller Rachel! Rachel!
gate_attendant_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
dr_ross_geller No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
gate_attendant_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, but...
phoebe_buffay RACHEL!!
rachel_green Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
phoebe_buffay Okay, you're on.
rachel_green What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
dr_ross_geller Okay, the thing is..
rachel_green Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Don't go.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
gate_attendant_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
gate_attendant_2#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode17 Miss?
rachel_green I - I have to get on the plane.
dr_ross_geller No, you don't.
rachel_green Yes, I do.
dr_ross_geller No, you don't.
rachel_green They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Rachel?
rachel_green I'm so sorry.
dr_ross_geller I really thought she'd stay.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry.
monica_geller Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
chandler_bing Wow, this is weird.
monica_geller I know.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
monica_geller I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
joey_tribbiani I love you!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani So did you guys make it in time?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
chandler_bing Where's Ross?
phoebe_buffay He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
rachel_green Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
rachel_green Excuse me?
airline_representative Miss? Please, sit down!
rachel_green I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
airline_representative Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
dr_ross_geller Let her off the plane!
airline_representative I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
rachel_green Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
dr_ross_geller Try to understand!
rachel_green Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
dr_ross_geller No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
rachel_green I got off the plane.
dr_ross_geller You got off the plane.
rachel_green I do love you.
dr_ross_geller I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
rachel_green Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
dr_ross_geller Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
rachel_green Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
dr_ross_geller This is it. Unless we're on a break.
dr_ross_geller Don't make jokes now.
monica_geller Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
monica_geller If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
dr_ross_geller Wow.
rachel_green I know. It seems smaller somehow.
joey_tribbiani Has it always been purple?
chandler_bing Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
phoebe_buffay Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
monica_geller Oh, yeah, that's true.
dr_ross_geller Uh, I haven't.
monica_geller Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
dr_ross_geller Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
monica_geller Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
chandler_bing Oh, okay.
phoebe_buffay So, I guess this is it.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I guess so.
monica_geller This is harder than I thought it would be.
chandler_bing Oh, it's gonna be okay.
rachel_green Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
monica_geller We got some time.
rachel_green Okay, should we get some coffee?
chandler_bing Sure. Where?
