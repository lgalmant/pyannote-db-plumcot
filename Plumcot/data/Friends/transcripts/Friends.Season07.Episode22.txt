dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
rachel_green Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
monica_geller Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
dr_ross_geller It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
monica_geller Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
rachel_green You let Joey drive it?!
phoebe_buffay I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
monica_geller Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
rachel_green Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
monica_geller Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
dr_ross_geller Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you got a couple hours?
dr_ross_geller Whew! That was a brisk ride!
rachel_green Take the top down did ya?
dr_ross_geller Only way to fly.
rachel_green Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
dr_ross_geller You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
rachel_green Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
dr_ross_geller Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
rachel_green I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
dr_ross_geller What?! Give-give me a brush.
rachel_green Gimme the keys!
dr_ross_geller No way!
rachel_green Well no brush!
dr_ross_geller Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
rachel_green Alimony.
monica_geller Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
chandler_bing Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
monica_geller Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
chandler_bing I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
monica_geller Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
chandler_bing Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
chandler_bing Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
monica_geller So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
rachel_green Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
rachel_green My God!
dr_ross_geller What do you think you're doing?!
rachel_green Just washing the windshield.
dr_ross_geller There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
rachel_green Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
dr_ross_geller With you?! Yeah right!
rachel_green All right.
dr_ross_geller Okay! Okay! Okay!
rachel_green What are you doing?! Get in the front!
dr_ross_geller In the death seat?!!
rachel_green Oh my

man#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 Wait a minute!
phoebe_buffay What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
joey_tribbiani So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
man#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 Over a month.
joey_tribbiani Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
man#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 Sure, I'd like that.
joey_tribbiani So uh, what's your name?
man#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 Its Jake.
joey_tribbiani Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
jake Yeah, big fan.
joey_tribbiani Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
jake Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
monica_geller Here!
chandler_bing What's this?
monica_geller It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
chandler_bing Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
monica_geller We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
chandler_bing Y'know we already went over this and I won!
monica_geller No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
chandler_bing Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
monica_geller Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know
chandler_bing No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
monica_geller Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
chandler_bing He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
monica_geller Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
chandler_bing Does it matter?!
monica_geller Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
chandler_bing Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
monica_geller Yes!
chandler_bing So I really never get to win anymore?
monica_geller How much did ever really win before?
joey_tribbiani Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
phoebe_buffay I know. They were mine.
joey_tribbiani Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
phoebe_buffay No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
joey_tribbiani That's weird!
phoebe_buffay I'm wearing his briefs right now.
joey_tribbiani That's...kinda hot.
phoebe_buffay I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
phoebe_buffay And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
joey_tribbiani Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
phoebe_buffay There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
phoebe_buffay I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
joey_tribbiani Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
phoebe_buffay Okay whatever.
joey_tribbiani You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
rachel_green God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
dr_ross_geller You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
rachel_green Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax
dr_ross_geller What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
rachel_green I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
rachel_green Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
rachel_green Really? You think so?
dr_ross_geller I was talking to myself! You're going down!
a_waiter_in_drag#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 Has someone taken your order yet?
monica_geller Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. She? I'm-I'm sorry I'm new. I don't
waiter_in_drag#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 Hm-mmm?
chandler_bing Yeah, I just ordered a beer!
waiter_in_drag#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode22 You're straight. I get it.
monica_geller I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
chandler_bing No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
monica_geller Why not?!
chandler_bing I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
