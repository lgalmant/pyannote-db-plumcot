joey Hello.
chandler Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I
joey Hello.
chandler Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm
joey Stop callin'!!
voice Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
joey All right!
voice What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything
chandler Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
phoebe Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
rachel So are things with you and Joey any better?
chandler They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
rachel Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
ross Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
rachel You shouldn't.
phoebe Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
ross Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
rachel Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
monica We haven't eaten yet!
rachel I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just
chandler Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
phoebe I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
chandler Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
phoebe Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
chandler Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials
phoebe Ohh.
monica Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
chandler Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
monica Who cares? He works in a museum!
chandler Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
phoebe You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
chandler Thanks.
monica What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
phoebe God, what happened?!
monica Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
rachel People are trying to sleep in here!
chandler Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
phoebe Open it up, let me see.
monica Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
chandler Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
phoebe Ooh, God it looks bad.
rachel Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
monica No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
chandler He's really picky about his patients.
phoebe Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
monica Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
phoebe Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
monica Yes!!
phoebe Yes! She's very excited about that.
phoebe This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
ross Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
phoebe Okay, get out of my kitchen!
chandler All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
phoebe All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
ross So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
chandler Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
ross Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
chandler I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
ross Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
chandler Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
ross Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
chandler Like?
ross Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
chandler When was the last time you saw her wear it?
ross Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
chandler Big dog?
ross Hey!
joey Hey!
ross What are you doing?
joey I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
ross Everything? Even the TV?
joey No! I'm putting that in my room.
ross Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
joey Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
ross That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
joey Five years.
ross You've sentenced him?!
joey Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
ross Joey, the guy's your best friend.
joey No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
ross Oh, who? Me?
joey Yeah!
ross Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
joey What?
ross I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
joey All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
kathy Oh my God, is it really that bad?
chandler I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
joey Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
gunther I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
kathy Oh.
chandler Hey Joe.
doctor I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
monica Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
rachel Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
nurse Dr. Burke will see you know.
monica Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
nurse Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
dr_timothy_burke Ready?
chandler Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
joey My folks.
chandler Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
joey I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
chandler What?!
joey Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I
chandler Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
joey Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
chandler Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
joey Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
chandler All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
joey When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
chandler What?
joey Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
chandler All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
joey We've got a box.
tim Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
monica I was probably waiting for it to open.
tim I gotta tell you, you look great now.
monica You look great too.
tim You're an excellent patient!
monica So how does it look?
tim Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
monica Like a pirate?!
tim If that helps you.
monica Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
tim I moved back here a couple of months ago.
monica Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
tim Uh.
monica No way!
tim I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
monica Oh.
tim But we broke up.
monica Oh.
tim She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
monica Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
tim You're not wearing the patch yet.
monica I know.
ross He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
rachel I know, it's sick.
monica Why is it sick?
rachel Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
monica Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
phoebe Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
ross Yeah.
joey What's twisted?
monica Me going out with Richard's son.
joey Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
chandler Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
rachel Is he okay in there?
joey He's fine!
ross Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
monica Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
rachel So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
joey Chandler?
chandler The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
ross Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
rachel Why?
ross I just wanna check something.
rachel Okay.
ross Now, we'll see.
chandler Air hole! Air hole!!
rachel Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
ross The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
rachel Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
ross Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
rachel Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
ross What did you get?
rachel Credit.
monica I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
tim Hi.
monica Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
tim Hi, nice to meet you.
monica And Joey.
joey Hey!
tim Hi, Joey.
monica My brother, Ross.
ross Hey.
monica And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
chandler How do ya do.
tim What's
monica Umm, well, he's
joey He's doin' some thinkin'!
chandler What happened? What happened?!
joey You kissed my girlfriend!
rachel Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
ross Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
monica All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
tim Where can I wash up?
monica Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
tim Thank you.
rachel Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
monica See he's nice. Right?
phoebe Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
tim Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
monica I saved you a seat.
rachel Sick-sick-sick-sick.
phoebe Oh, I'll get it.
chandler Gotcha!
joey That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
chandler Sorry!
joey Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
chandler Okay, okay, you got it!
rachel Ross, can you pass me the yams?
ross Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
rachel Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
monica Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
ross There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
rachel Okay, fine.
chandler You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
joey All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
chandler You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
joey So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
chandler Absolutely!
joey That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
rachel Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
ross I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
monica Ooh, this always happens.
tim Here, let me help.
monica Thank you.
tim You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
monica Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
tim Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
monica I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
tim Oh, I totally agree.
monica We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
tim What?
monica Nothing. Nothing.
tim No-no really, was-was that not okay?
monica No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss
tim Oh my God! It didn't remind you of
monica Don't say it!
tim No, but it did! Didn't it?!
monica Yeah!
tim Oh man!!
monica I know!
joey I'll get it.
kathy Oh.
joey Hey.
kathy Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am
joey That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
kathy Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
joey In the box.
kathy Chandler?
phoebe Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
kathy Why not? What's going on?
phoebe He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
kathy By being in a box?
rachel Joey, had reasons.
phoebe They were threefold.
kathy Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
joey Open the box!!
rachel What?!
joey He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
chandler So?
joey Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
chandler Yeah?
joey Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
chandler Man, this is
joey Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
joey All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
rachel Oh, he sees her!
monica Oh, he's catching up to her!
phoebe Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
ross He's taking her purse!
joey Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
phoebe Oh, there they are!
phoebe All right, get a room.
