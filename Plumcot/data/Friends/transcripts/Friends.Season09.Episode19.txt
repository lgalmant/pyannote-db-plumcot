joey_tribbiani God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
joey_tribbiani I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
rachel_green I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
joey_tribbiani Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
rachel_green Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
rachel_green Are you serious?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
rachel_green Hey, that was an honest mistake!
joey_tribbiani Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
rachel_green Yeah, that was an awesome day!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
monica_geller So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
phoebe_buffay Sure!
dr_ross_geller I'd love to!
monica_geller Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
phoebe_buffay Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, what happened?
phoebe_buffay Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
chandler_bing Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
phoebe_buffay Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
chandler_bing What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
phoebe_buffay Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
chandler_bing So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
monica_geller Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
chandler_bing Are you really that busy?
monica_geller Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
chandler_bing Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
monica_geller Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
phoebe_buffay And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
chandler_bing "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
dr_ross_geller Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
chandler_bing I don't have travel insurance.
dr_ross_geller Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
monica_geller Why don't you take Ross?
dr_ross_geller Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
monica_geller No, not if their room has two beds!
dr_ross_geller I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
rachel_green Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
rachel_green Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
joey_tribbiani Also so gay!
rachel_green Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
joey_tribbiani Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
the_director Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
joey_tribbiani Oh, wish me luck!
rachel_green Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?

olivia What do you know about love?
joey_tribbiani I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
olivia That kiss never happened.
joey_tribbiani Oh, what about this one.
rachel_green OH!
olivia No, I told you...get out!
joey_tribbiani Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
chase You look familiar, have we...
rachel_green SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
joey_tribbiani Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
olivia I don't have a choice...
joey_tribbiani Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.

customer_1 Everything was delicious!
monica_geller Thank you!
customer_2 It was. The duck in particular was superb.
monica_geller Thank you! You haven't said anything...
customer_3 Actually I do have one small complaint.
monica_geller Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
customer_3 The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
monica_geller What musician?
phoebe_buffay And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ol√®!
monica_geller What are you doing here!
phoebe_buffay Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
monica_geller Great!
phoebe_buffay Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
monica_geller Listen Phoebe...
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
phoebe_buffay But what?
monica_geller This is kind of a classy place.
phoebe_buffay Ok, say no more.
phoebe_buffay : It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?
chandler_bing Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
chandler_bing New York.
dr_ross_geller The big apple!
chandler_bing I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
chandler_bing Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
dr_ross_geller Check again please!
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 I'm sorry, it's not here.
dr_ross_geller Not there.
chandler_bing Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 I don't know what to say.
dr_ross_geller She doesn't know what to say!
chandler_bing Just give us the cheapest room you have.
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
chandler_bing That's insane!
dr_ross_geller Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
chandler_bing Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 Great.
chandler_bing What!? They are totally ripping us off!
dr_ross_geller Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
chandler_bing Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
dr_ross_geller C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
chandler_bing Dude, you're shaking!
dr_ross_geller I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
joey_tribbiani Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
rachel_green God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
joey_tribbiani Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
rachel_green Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
joey_tribbiani Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
rachel_green Oh screw her, that part is mine!
joey_tribbiani Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
rachel_green Okay. Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you married him.
rachelactress#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
joey_tribbiani So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
rachelactress#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 It's over! You have to accept that.
joey_tribbiani How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
rachel_green Kiss me.
joey_tribbiani What?
rachel_green Kiss me.
joey_tribbiani Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
rachel_green No, I'm saying...
joey_tribbiani but, but..
rachel_green just... don't talk...
rachel_green Ehhh, aw! Well, that's new!
dr_ross_geller Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
dr_ross_geller What did you get?
chandler_bing USA Today
dr_ross_geller Nice, put it with the others.
chandler_bing And I also got... two more apples.
dr_ross_geller We are four short of a bush-o God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
chandler_bing I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's not cool.
chandlers#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 Dude, none of this is cool.
dr_ross_geller No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
chandler_bing I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs..oh, you already got that.
dr_ross_geller Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
chandler_bing Ok, how about this ?
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
chandler_bing Yes, but the batteries...
chandler_bing Thank you, thank you very much!
dr_ross_geller Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
chandler_bing No!
dr_ross_geller At least tell me where you hid it.
rachel_green Can I ask you a question?
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
monica_geller Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
rachel_green Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
monica_geller Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
rachel_green Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
monica_geller What do you think brought than on?
rachel_green I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
monica_geller A love scene? With who?
rachel_green Olivia.
monica_geller Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
rachel_green So do you think that my dream means anything?
monica_geller I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
rachel_green Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
monica_geller Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
rachel_green You took the same class twice.
monica_geller It was hard!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller@rachel_green Hi.
phoebe_buffay Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
monica_geller Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
phoebe_buffay Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
monica_geller Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back
rachel_green Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
phoebe_buffay My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
rachel_green Ok, we're still on that.
monica_geller I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
phoebe_buffay Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
monica_geller Tiny portions?
phoebe_buffay Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!
monica_geller Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
phoebe_buffay Well...it's not about quality.
monica_geller Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
phoebe_buffay Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
monica_geller Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
phoebe_buffay Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
monica_geller You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
phoebe_buffay What are people having, the garlic Martini?
receptionist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode19 Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
chandler_bing Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
chandler_bing Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
dr_ross_geller Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
dr_ross_geller Oh my god.
chandler_bing What?
dr_ross_geller There's something new in the bowl.
chandler_bing Look, we have enough, just walk away.
dr_ross_geller No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
chandler_bing There's a forest right outside.
dr_ross_geller It's not the same.
chandler_bing Ok, go quick!
dr_ross_geller Thank you for a delightful stay.
dr_ross_geller Oh, my maple candy!
phoebe_buffay Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..
monica_geller Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
phoebe_buffay You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
monica_geller Ok, you have to stop playing now.
phoebe_buffay Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
monica_geller Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
phoebe_buffay Get your garlic-peelers off me!
monica_geller Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here... Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
phoebe_buffay Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
monica_geller Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?
phoebe_buffay Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
monica_geller Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
phoebe_buffay Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?
monica_geller Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
phoebe_buffay Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
monica_geller I'm sorry...
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry too...
monica_geller ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
phoebe_buffay Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
joey_tribbiani Oh man! I thought I got it all!
rachel_green How...how...?
joey_tribbiani I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
rachel_green uh-huh
joey_tribbiani And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
rachel_green Wow...definitely just Drake...
joey_tribbiani What?
rachel_green What...how is it going with Drake?
joey_tribbiani Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
rachel_green What...that scene I saw was so good!
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
rachel_green Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
joey_tribbiani A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
rachel_green So?
joey_tribbiani So...I've never played that!
rachel_green Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
joey_tribbiani Uh...well...just once...with you...
rachel_green Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
joey_tribbiani What the hell are you talking about??
rachel_green Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
joey_tribbiani Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
rachel_green Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
joey_tribbiani Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
joey_tribbiani Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!!
chandler_bing I got you something from Vermont!
monica_geller Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty!
dr_ross_geller Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
