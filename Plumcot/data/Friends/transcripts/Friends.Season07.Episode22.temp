ross Hey!
monica Hey!
ross Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
rachel Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
monica Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
ross It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
monica Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
joey Hey!
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey!
joey Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
rachel You let Joey drive it?!
phoebe I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
monica Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
rachel Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
phoebe Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
monica Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
ross Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
joey Yeah, you got a couple hours?
ross Whew! That was a brisk ride!
rachel Take the top down did ya?
ross Only way to fly.
rachel Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
ross You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
rachel Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
ross Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
rachel I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
ross What?! Give-give me a brush.
rachel Gimme the keys!
ross No way!
rachel Well no brush!
ross Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
rachel Alimony.
monica Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
chandler Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
monica Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
chandler I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
monica Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
chandler Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
phoebe Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
chandler Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
monica So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
phoebe Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
rachel Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
rachel My God!
ross What do you think you're doing?!
rachel Just washing the windshield.
ross There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
rachel Oh.
ross No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
rachel Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
ross With you?! Yeah right!
rachel All right.
ross Okay! Okay! Okay!
rachel What are you doing?! Get in the front!
ross In the death seat?!!
rachel Oh my
man Hey guys!
joey Hey!
phoebe Hey sweetie!
man Ready to go?
phoebe Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
man Wait a minute!
phoebe What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
joey So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
man Over a month.
joey Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
man Sure, I'd like that.
joey So uh, what's your name?
man Its Jake.
joey Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
jake Yeah, big fan.
joey Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
jake Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
monica Here!
chandler What's this?
monica It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
chandler Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
monica We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
chandler Y'know we already went over this and I won!
monica No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
chandler Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
monica Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know
chandler No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
monica Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
chandler He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
monica Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
chandler Does it matter?!
monica Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
chandler Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
monica Yes!
chandler So I really never get to win anymore?
monica How much did ever really win before?
joey Pheebs!
phoebe Hey!
joey Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
phoebe Yeah!
joey Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
phoebe I know. They were mine.
joey Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
phoebe No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
joey That's weird!
phoebe I'm wearing his briefs right now.
joey That's...kinda hot.
phoebe I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
joey Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
phoebe And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
joey Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
phoebe There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
joey Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
phoebe I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
joey Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
phoebe Okay whatever.
joey You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
rachel God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
ross You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
rachel Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax
ross What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
rachel I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
rachel Uh-oh.
ross Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
rachel Really? You think so?
ross I was talking to myself! You're going down!
a_waiter_in_drag Has someone taken your order yet?
monica Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. She? I'm-I'm sorry I'm new. I don't
waiter_in_drag Hm-mmm?
chandler Yeah, I just ordered a beer!
waiter_in_drag You're straight. I get it.
monica I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
chandler No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
monica Why not?!
chandler I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
monica What?!
chandler Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
announcer Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
helena Hello darlings.
chandler And there's daddy!
