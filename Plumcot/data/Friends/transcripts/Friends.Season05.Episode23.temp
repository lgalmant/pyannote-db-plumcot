rachel Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
phoebe Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
rachel No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
phoebe Okay!
rachel Sucker!
phoebe Hello? Hey Joey!
joey Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
phoebe Sure! Where is it?
joey Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
phoebe Ohh! So you're 5639?!
joey That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
chandler Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
joey No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
a_casino_boss Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
phoebe Who was that?
joey Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
chandler Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
joey Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
phoebe Yeah!
chandler Hey!
joey Don't come out here!
chandler No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
joey I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
chandler Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
joey Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
a_tourist Would you mind doing a picture with us?
chandler Uh, what was that?
joey Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
phoebe Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
monica Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
phoebe It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
monica Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
phoebe Which Richard?
monica The Richard.
phoebe Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
monica Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
phoebe Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
monica It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
phoebe That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
monica Really?
phoebe But again, Simmons. Go on.
monica The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
phoebe Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
monica Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
phoebe Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
monica I know.
phoebe Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
monica What?
phoebe On a totally different bet.
chandler Hey!
monica It's almost our anniversary!
chandler I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
phoebe Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
chandler Huh.
monica I got you a present!
chandler Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
monica I know, but you have to open it today!
chandler Okay.
monica Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
chandler Wow!
monica For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
chandler Do we have to?
monica No.
chandler Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
monica Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
chandler Yeah, I think we should see other people.
monica But we can go, right?
chandler Yes.
monica Okay!
chandler It's a great idea.
phoebe Okay, I'm gonna go too!
chandler Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
phoebe Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
monica Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
phoebe Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
rachel Hi!
phoebe Hey!
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
rachel Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
phoebe Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
rachel Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
ross Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
chandler Art lover!
ross What'd you say?
chandler I said art lover.
ross Is that supposed to be an insult?
chandler I don't know, I'm very tired.
ross So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
rachel That sounds great.
ross Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
rachel Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
phoebe Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
rachel No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
phoebe Naked alone time.
rachel No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
phoebe Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
phoebe So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
chandler So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
phoebe Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
chandler Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
phoebe Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
chandler Happy plane-aversary.
monica Aww! I love you!
chandler Can I give you a present now?
monica Okay!
chandler Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
monica I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
chandler How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
monica Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
chandler Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
phoebe Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
chandler What-what Richard thing?
phoebe Oh no.
chandler What Richard thing?
phoebe Simmons! Go with Simmons!
monica Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
chandler I'm not mad.
monica Really?!
chandler Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
monica Great!
phoebe Okay, London 1
rachel Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen... naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
ross Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes - Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
rachel Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
ross Hey.
ross May I come in?
rachel Uh, yeah, if you want too.
ross Do you want me too?
rachel Yeah, sure?
ross So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
rachel And um, what-what is that Ross?
ross The physical act of love.
rachel What?! Are you crazy?
ross Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
rachel Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
ross You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
rachel Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
ross No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
rachel Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
ross Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
rachel Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
ross Thank you.
rachel Yes.
ross All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
rachel Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
phoebe Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
monica Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
phoebe For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
chandler Oh my God.
phoebe Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
joey Hi!
chandler Love your condoms my man.
joey What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
phoebe Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
joey Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
monica Who are you talking too?
joey They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
chandler Why?! What happened?!
joey Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
monica I'm so sorry.
joey Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
chandler No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
monica I knew you were not okay with that.
phoebe So you're a gladiator! Wow!
joey Yeah, what-what's going on?
phoebe Monica had lunch with Richard.
joey Dawson?!
phoebe Noo! But that would've been so cool!
chandler No! Her boyfriend Richard!
monica It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
chandler When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
monica You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
chandler Thanks.
joey Aww, there we go.
phoebe I love Vegas!
monica I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
chandler Next time?
joey Ooh, so close.
chandler There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
monica I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
chandler That's so funny, because I think I just did!
monica Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
chandler Fine with me!
monica Fine! Happy Anniversary!
joey Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
monica No it is not!
chandler What are you talking
joey Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
rachel Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
ross Yep! That's hilarious!
rachel I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
ross Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
rachel No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
ross Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
rachel Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
ross What?! You totally get embarrassed!
rachel No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
ross Is that so?
rachel Yeah.
ross Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
joey Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
chandler Really?
joey Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
chandler Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
joey All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
chandler Whoa!
joey Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
chandler Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
joey Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
chandler Good luck!
joey Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
chandler I see.
monica Thank you.
phoebe Thanks.
monica I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
phoebe Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
monica This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
phoebe So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
monica Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
phoebe Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
monica Anybody lose this?
the_croupier Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
monica Hmm.
guy So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
rachel Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
rachel Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
ross Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
ross What the? What

chandler What?
joey My identical hand twin!
chandler What's an identical hand twin?
joey What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
chandler Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
joey Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
chandler How?
joey Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
chandler Again I must go back to, how?
joey This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
chandler Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
joey Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
chandler No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
phoebe Hey!
joey Pheebs!!
phoebe Yeah?
joey I found my identical hand twin!
phoebe Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
chandler No!
phoebe But she just came up here!
chandler That was Joey!
phoebe I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
chandler Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
phoebe Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
chandler Really?
phoebe Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
chandler Okay.
phoebe Good. I should really start wearing hats!

rachel Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can - you have so crossed a line.
ross Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
phoebe Ugh!
ross What?
phoebe That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
ross Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
phoebe M-M-Mole people?
ross What? No-no, a lurker.
phoebe Oh. What's a lurker?
ross Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then
phoebe Kills you?
ross No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
phoebe Ohhh!
ross Uh-hmm.
phoebe How do you know about this?
ross My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance - karate lessons.
phoebe Dance karate?
ross Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
rachel All right, it won't come off!
ross What?!
rachel It won't come off!
ross Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?

joey No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
ross Your what?
joey My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
ross What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
joey Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.

monica What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
chandler Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
monica Not any more.
chandler Really?!
monica Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.

rachel Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
ross Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
rachel Ross, I am a human doodle!!
ross Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons... of... freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
