chandler Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
rachel That's a good story, Grandpa.
ross Hey
all Hey
ross Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
monica Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
phoebe That is nice and we're done. TADA!
chandler I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
monica Oh, here.
chandler See now it feels like Christmas!
ross ... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
rachel So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
joey Hey you guys.
chandler Hey Joe what's up?
joey I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like
chandler I can see why that's hard to resist.
joey I like her so much!
monica Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
joey I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
chandler You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
ross I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
janine Hey guys!
ross Hi Janine!
janine I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
monica Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
janine Yeah, that's what I said.
monica Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
chandler Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
janine Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
ross You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
janine Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
joey Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
janine Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
ross Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
janine Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
ross Are you serious?
monica We are there!
chandler What, what are you laughing at?
rachel Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
janine Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
all Bye!
ross Bye Janine!
joey Did she just ask me out on a date?
chandler I don't think so.
monica What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
rachel Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
joey Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
rachel Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
ross It was a dry day.
monica We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
ross Oh my God!
monica Oh my God!
chandler Oh my God!
joey OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember - stay cool.
ross Got it!
ross Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
director OK, everyone gather up.
monica_and_ross 'Scuse us
director Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
ross Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
director Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
joey Ross! So when is it gonna air?
rachel Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
chandler I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
phoebe Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
rachel We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
chandler What? That's terrible!
phoebe No-no, we do it every year!
chandler Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
phoebe No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
rachel Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
chandler No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
phoebe But we have to!
chandler No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
phoebe Well then, you should look with us.
chandler Why?
rachel Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
chandler No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
phoebe Oh, that's it? A great idea!
rachel Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
chandler If I help, we can find 'em faster!
rachel That's right!
phoebe Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
rachel Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
phoebe Ooh, who's it for?
rachel Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
phoebe Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
rachel We are so gonna find them this year.
chandler Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
rachel Yeah.
chandler You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
phoebe_and_rachel No, we never do that
chandler Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
monica Okay, here comes another camera.
ross Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
ross Why do they keep doing that?
monica If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
ross Right.
ross Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
girl We learned how to dance.
monica Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
ross Yeah!
janine Hey! You're a good dancer!
joey Really?
janine Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
joey What do you mean?
janine Like this.
janine That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
joey Uh-huh.
director Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
joey No-no-no-no-no we came together!
director I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
joey No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
director Really, y'think so? I don't..
chandler I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
rachel Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
phoebe Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
chandler Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
phoebe Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
rachel Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
chandler Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
phoebe Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
rachel Ha!
chandler Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
rachel Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
joey Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
ross We know!
monica Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
ross Okay.
director Okay, everybody hold!
director Next on the platforms are.....you two! And.....You two!
monica Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
ross Monica! Would it?
joey Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
tall_guy She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
joey Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown - I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
tall_guy No I don't think so.
joey Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
tall_guy Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
joey Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
tall_guy No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
joey Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
tall_guy God! What are you, in second grade?
joey Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
monica Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
ross Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
monica What?
ross The routine!
monica Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
ross Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
monica Was it really that good?
ross We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
monica Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
monica 5 6 7 8!
ross So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
director Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
monica Yes!
director Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
tall_guy Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
director What's going on over here?
joey Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
director What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
joey Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
ross Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
monica I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
ross No!
monica Me too!
ross Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
monica Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
director Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
joeys_head Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
all Three, Two, One!
director Cut!
joey No! Year! Happy No Year!
director Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
phoebe Hey! Look who I found!
chandler Oh, hey guys!
phoebe Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
chandler Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
phoebe Or we could just follow your clever jokes - any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
chandler Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
phoebe Hmm, how about my azzz?
rachel Hey, this is hollow.
phoebe What?
rachel This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
phoebe No, don't look directly at them!
chandler What?
phoebe Alright, no, we could look at them!
rachel Oh, this one's for me!
phoebe Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
chandler Oh great!
phoebe And the big one's for me!
rachel Ooh, let's open them!
chandler Okay! Okay! Okay!
phoebe Hee hee!
chandler Wait, we can't do this.
phoebe_and_rachel Why?
chandler I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
rachel Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
chandler Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
phoebe Will you get us better gifts?
chandler Fine!
monica Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
chandler That's what you got me?
phoebe Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
joey Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
janine Joey.
joey Yeah?
janine 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
joey Oh, yoii. What was that for?
janine Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
joey Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
janine In the moment, yeah.
joey But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
janine Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
joey No.
janine Me neither.
joey 3, 2,
janine Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
joey Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
monica We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
rachel Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
monica Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
rachel 'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
monica What? We could do it!
ross I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
monica I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
monica_and_ross 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
monica I can't do it!
chandler Now you do that, you're on TV.
