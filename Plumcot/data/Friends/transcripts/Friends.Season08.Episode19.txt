rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.
joey_tribbiani Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!
monica_geller How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
joey_tribbiani Yeah you are baby.
monica_geller Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
rachel_green So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
joey_tribbiani No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
dr_ross_geller Why'd you say no?
joey_tribbiani Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
chandler_bing If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
rachel_green Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?
chandler_bing Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
rachel_green Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
joey_tribbiani Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
dr_ross_geller Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
rachel_green Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
the_interviewer I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
joey_tribbiani Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
monica_geller You think we're being obvious?
chandler_bing No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
the_interviewer Y'know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y'know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
joey_tribbiani Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
gunther Can I get you anything?
the_interviewer Umm, I'll have a cup of coffee.
joey_tribbiani And I'll have all the muffins.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Shhh! We're not talking.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Finally! Oh.
the_interviewer So, according to your bio, you've done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you're particularly proud of?
host#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode19 Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
mike#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode19 And there is Kevin.
mike#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode19 This is the first time he's ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
joey_tribbiani Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
lauren So this is it? Victor?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I guess it is. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne... baby...I'm gonna want to meet her.
joey_tribbiani Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
chandler_bing Nice work my friend.
joey_tribbiani Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am
joey_tribbiani Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
phoebe_buffay I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
rachel_green Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
dr_ross_geller Uh, double latte, extra foam.
chandler_bing And a bagel with only
phoebe_buffay I was just being polite!
the_interviewer Okay, how about when you're not working. What do you do in your spare time?
joey_tribbiani Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
rachel_green That is the Coast Guard.
joey_tribbiani What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
joey_tribbiani Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
chandler_bing Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
dr_ross_geller Come on, it's fun!
chandler_bing All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
joey_tribbiani Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
chandler_bing Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
joey_tribbiani I think you're right.
chandler_bing All right, ready?
joey_tribbiani One.
chandler_bing Two.
both#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode19 Three.
joey_tribbiani That's kinda nice.
chandler_bing Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing You wanna see if we still have it?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing FREE PORN!!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!!
chandler_bing We have free porn here!!!
joey_tribbiani In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids. Y'know a mento, a role model.
the_interviewer A mento
joey_tribbiani Right.
the_interviewer Like the candy?
joey_tribbiani Matter of fact, I do.
the_interviewer Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
joey_tribbiani Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
joey_tribbiani Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
dr_ross_geller Are you serious?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
dr_ross_geller Wow! We are pretty good at this!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
joey_tribbiani Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
chandler_bing What's wrong with you?
joey_tribbiani Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
chandler_bing This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
joey_tribbiani No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
rachel_green It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef saut√°ed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
dr_ross_geller It tastes like feet!
joey_tribbiani I like it.
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding?
joey_tribbiani What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
joey_tribbiani The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
chandler_bing That's still in there?!
joey_tribbiani Not anymore.
rachel_green Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
chandler_bing Stick to your side!
rachel_green Hey, come on now!
joey_tribbiani All right, what are we havin'?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
gunther Your muffins.
joey_tribbiani I'll take those to go. For the kids.
the_interviewer Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
joey_tribbiani It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said. But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.
the_interviewer Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
joey_tribbiani Well, I said that I
joey_tribbiani You guys, this is Shelley, she's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends
rachel_green Hi! I'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
dr_ross_geller Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
the_interviewer Umm, I'm gonna just go get this warmed up.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
monica_geller Joey! You're doing great!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
chandler_bing Mento?
joey_tribbiani No thanks.
the_interviewer So, as Joey's friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
dr_ross_geller Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
rachel_green Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I......I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
phoebe_buffay Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
the_interviewer Oh! I like that. What's your name?

monica_geller Bye.
the_interviewer So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
joey_tribbiani How come you have two? Chandler: Well this one's for you. Joey: Get out. Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Chandler: That's what they'll call us.
rachel_green Oh, Joey! Sorry!
joey_tribbiani No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
rachel_green Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
joey_tribbiani Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
rachel_green Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Look!
rachel_green I've never lived like this before.
joey_tribbiani I know.
joey_tribbiani All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
dr_ross_geller All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes
joey_tribbiani Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
joey_tribbiani All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
phoebe_buffay Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
joey_tribbiani Judge rules, no violation.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh.
joey_tribbiani And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
phoebe_buffay No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
joey_tribbiani Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, tough call.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
joey_tribbiani I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Ewwww!!
monica_geller You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
dr_ross_geller@phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Ewwww!!
joey_tribbiani That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
joey_tribbiani Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
the_interviewer So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
joey_tribbiani Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
chandler_bing It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
the_interviewer Now, off the record, you're not
joey_tribbiani What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
dr_ross_geller Your make-up!
dr_ross_geller Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
joey_tribbiani I think face to face.
dr_ross_geller I would say that.
joey_tribbiani Face to face, yeah!
dr_ross_geller Okay, here I go.
joey_tribbiani All right.
joey_tribbiani Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
dr_ross_geller I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
phoebe_buffay Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
chandler_bing You're turning into a woman.
joey_tribbiani No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
chandler_bing Now I've upset you? What did I say?
joey_tribbiani It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
joey_tribbiani Great nap.
dr_ross_geller It really was.
joey_tribbiani Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
the_interviewer So, let's talk about women. I'm sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"

joey_tribbiani Hey, how you doin'?
rachel_green Don't!!
janine_lecroix No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
joey_tribbiani Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
janine_lecroix I don't think so.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I do. How you doin?
janine_lecroix I'm okay.
joey_tribbiani What?!?! Oh dear God!
joey_tribbiani Not much to tell there I'm really shy.

joey_tribbiani Oh great! Great! Thank you.
the_interviewer Bye.
joey_tribbiani Bye-bye. I did it!
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Amazing! Amazing!
the_interviewer Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what's your favorite soap opera?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
the_interviewer Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
joey_tribbiani Oh, good to know. So close!
rachel_green Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
monica_geller You slept with her didn't you?
joey_tribbiani Little bit, yeah.
dr_ross_geller Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
dr_ross_geller Did you just wink at me?
joey_tribbiani Hey, you're the one that loves the picture.
