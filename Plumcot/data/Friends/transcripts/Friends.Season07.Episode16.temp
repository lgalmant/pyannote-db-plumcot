ross Okay! All clear!
ben Thanks Phoebe!
rachel Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
ross Everything okay in there?
ben Don't talk to me now!
rachel Awww, just like his daddy.
ross Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
rachel What-what about Monica?
ross Oh, she isn't home.
rachel So it would just be, me alone?
ross Well, Ben would be there.
rachel Huh umm
ross What's the matter?

ross Rach, he's not an ex-con.
rachel Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
ross I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
rachel Okay.
ross Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
rachel Yeah I think so.
ross I wasn't talking to you.
ben I'll be okay.
ross Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
ben Bye dad.
rachel Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
ben Not really.

rachel Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
ben I'm not allowed to have soda.
rachel Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
ben What's a virgin?
rachel Water it is.
monica What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
chandler You mean the spitter?
monica Come on! It wasn't that bad!
chandler Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
monica All right, what about the third guy?
chandler You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
monica Can you blame him?
chandler Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
monica Well then we still have a problem.
chandler Yeah!
phoebe With what?
monica Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
phoebe Oo! You should have one of us do it!
monica Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
phoebe No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
monica Are you serious?
phoebe Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
joey I call it!!
phoebe What?! No! It was my idea!
chandler Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
joey Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
chandler We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
rachel Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
ben But you're not anymore!
rachel No, I'm not.
ben 'Cause you guys were on a break.
rachel Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
ben When's my daddy coming back?
rachel Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
ben Sharing is good.
rachel Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
ben Really? Like how?
rachel Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
ben That's a good one.
rachel Yeah? You like that one?
ben Yeah, you're funny.
rachel I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
ben Can I do it to you?
rachel Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
joey So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
chandler No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
monica We're never gonna find anybody.
joey Well then let me do it!
chandler Joe
joey No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
monica Joey look it's really sweet
joey No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
monica That is true.
joey Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
chandler Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
monica It might be kinda cool.
joey So I can do it?
chandler Yeah you can do it.
joey All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
chandler Yeah.
joey Okay.
monica Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
phoebe Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
monica Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
phoebe Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
monica Here, take a couple of these.
phoebe What is it?
monica It's Hexadrin.
phoebe Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
monica Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
phoebe Oh.
joey Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
rachel Coming.
ross I have a bone to pick with you.
rachel Uh-oh.
ross Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
rachel Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
ross That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
rachel Oh that.
ross Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
rachel Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
ross I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
rachel Yes.
phoebe It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
monica Hexadrin.
phoebe Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
monica No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
phoebe Say what?
monica Y'know, the possible side affects.
phoebe Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
monica Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
phoebe Why?
monica In case it happens.
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
chandler Hey!
monica You did it! You got ordained?!
joey Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
chandler Our minister
phoebe I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
monica Phoebe, your liver is right here.
phoebe Okay, then I must be disoriented.
joey Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
chandler Okay.
monica Yeah!
joey Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
chandler Should we call the spitter?
carol Hey Rachel!
rachel Hi!
carol What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
rachel Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
carol Can I ask what-Come on in.
rachel Okay.
carol Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
rachel I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
ben Gotcha!!
rachel I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
carol Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
rachel Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
ben Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
rachel Don't do that.
ben Don't do that.
rachel Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
ben Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
rachel Oh damnit!
ben Oh damnit!
rachel No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
ben Damnit!
rachel No don't! Go back to repeating!
ben Damnit!
rachel Oh crap!
ben Oh crap!
phoebe I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
monica Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
phoebe Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
joey Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
chandler Yeah. O-okay.
joey "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
monica How about receiving?
joey Yes!
chandler See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
joey Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
chandler No, not us... Us!
monica I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
phoebe Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
monica It doesn't say that!
phoebe Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
chandler See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
joey Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
monica There you go!
joey "...by doin' it."
chandler Joe?
joey Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
chandler Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
joey Yeah!! I call that London style.
monica No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
joey Oh.
monica And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much
joey Yeah baby!
chandler And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
joey Oh.
chandler But then later that night
joey Yeah baby!
chandler Hey!
monica Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
chandler Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
monica Is Joey here?
chandler Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
monica Wouldn't you be?
chandler Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
monica Really?
chandler You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
monica Well, not anymore.
chandler But we don't do that.
monica I know, I just thought it would be fun.
chandler How drunk are you?
monica Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
chandler That's the perfect amount!
monica Okay!
monica Y'know what's weird?
chandler What?
monica This doesn't feel weird!
chandler I know.
monica You're a really good kisser.
chandler Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
monica Hm-hmm!
chandler Okay!
monica Wow! You are really fast!
chandler It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica We're gonna see each other naked.
chandler Yep!
monica Do you wanna do it at the same time?
chandler Count of three?
monica One!
chandler Two!
monica Two!
monica_and_chandler Three!
chandler Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
monica Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
chandler Eh!
chandler Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e
joey Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
chandler No! No! No!
joey Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
chandler They're in my bag over there.
joey Ah.
chandler Uh, could you leave me one?
joey For just you?
chandler Yeah.
joey Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
chandler No I-I-I'm fine.
joey All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
joey That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
monica Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
joey Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
phoebe Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
monica What?!
chandler What?
phoebe What?!
chandler Who did you originally want to hook up with?
monica Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
joey Yeah baby! No baby!
chandler So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
monica No because it-it didn't seem important.
chandler Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
monica Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
joey And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
chandler I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
monica Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
joey Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
chandler Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
joey What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
chandler Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
monica Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
chandler It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
joey This is crazy.
phoebe I know! Robin is so gay!
rachel So now what have we agreed?
ben No more pranks.
rachel And-and what else?
ben That you and daddy were not on a break.
rachel Very good.
ross Rachel! What are you doing here?
rachel I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
ross Your good friend?
rachel Yeah!
ross What's her last name?
rachel Carol...Lesbian?
ross Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
rachel What line?
ross Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
rachel All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
ross Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
carol Hey Ross!
ross Hi.
carol What's not funny?
ross Practical jokes.
carol Oh I...I think they're funny.
ross You have a line down your face.
carol What?
rachel Okay, maybe they are not funny to you
carol Oh my God!
rachel Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
ross Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
rachel That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
ross I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
rachel Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
ross No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
rachel Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
ben Crap!!
rachel I gotta go!
joey Hey.
chandler Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
joey Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
chandler Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
joey No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
chandler How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
joey Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
chandler That's what you should say.
joey What?
chandler When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
joey Really? I can do it?
chandler I'd love it if you would do it.
joey Hey!
chandler But those are the words! Those exact words!
joey Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
ross Hey!
rachel Hey!
ross Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so
rachel Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
ross Okay, I'll see you later pal.
rachel Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
ross What?
rachel I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
ross What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
rachel Oh I
ben What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
ross All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
rachel No! Wait! Come on!
ross Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
rachel No you guys
ross I-I-am-
rachel EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
joey Hey!
monica Hey-hey.
joey So are guys doing okay?
chandler Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
monica Yeah baby!
phoebe I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
monica Honey! Dinner's ready!
fat_joey What's my little chef got for me tonight?
monica Your favorite!
joey Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
monica Yep! And lot's of it!
