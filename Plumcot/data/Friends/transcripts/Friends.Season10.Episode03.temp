chandler So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
joey Yeah. It's actually our first official date
chandler Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
joey Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
chandler What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
joey It's OK!
chandler How can you be so confident?
joey Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
chandler Really? Like you have a routine?
joey No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
chandler Really?
joey No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
chandler You mean like this?
joey NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
chandler Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
joey More foosball?
chandler ..and beer!!
monica Hey!
ross_and_chandler Hey!
monica Hey sweetie!
ross WOW!
chandler Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
ross I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
chandler She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
ross Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
monica Chandler gets pedicures!
ross Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
chandler Why...why?
ross Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
chandler Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
ross So, do you get colours or just French tips?
monica There. Here's their card.
ross Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
phoebe Hey!
chandler Hey Pheebs!
monica Hey Phoebe!
phoebe Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
monica I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
chandler Who's Amanda?
monica She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
chandler Are you trying to do a British accent?
monica Chandler gets pedicures!
chandler Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
phoebe You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
monica I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
phoebe Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
monica Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
phoebe Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
monica What?
phoebe Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
monica Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
chandler No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
ross Well... I like how you look, what are you?
assistant Puerto Rican.
ross Two, I think a two.
assistant You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
ross Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
assistant Wow, you catch on quick.
ross Well, I have a PhD, so...
ross One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
ross You sprayed my front twice!
assistant You've never turned?
ross No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
assistant Mississippi? I said count to five'!
ross Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?
assistant Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.
ross So, how dark is it gonna get?
assistant You got sprayed with two two' s and...
ross I'm a four?
assistant Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
ross Really!
assistant You might wanna get back in there.
ross Ok!
ross Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
assistant You got two more twos?
ross I'm an eight!
joey I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
rachel So.
joey Yeah.
joey Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
rachel I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
joey What's the matter?
rachel I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!
joey_and_rachel Okay
rachel Ok, so sorry.
rachel I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!
joey I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
rachel Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
joey Ok.
joey Uh, was that good for you?
phoebe Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
monica It could be Amanda!
phoebe Oh, you're right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
amanda Hello Monica. It's Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
monica You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
amanda Let's see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.
phoebe Ok, don't hold thy breath!
chandler Hello? Is someone on the line?
amanda Yes, I was looking for Monica.
chandler Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
monica We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
chandler I get pedicures!
monica Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
phoebe Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
monica Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
phoebe Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
monica And you would?
phoebe I did!
rachel Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
joey Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
rachel Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
joey Ok, yeah, got it.
rachel_and_joey Okay.
joey This thing welded shut?!
rachel Okay.
joey All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
rachel Oh!
rachel Ow!
joey Sorry!
rachel Well this is romantic!
joey I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
rachel It's a standard issue bra clasp!
joey Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
rachel Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
joey NAH! I don't have another level!!
chandler Hold on! There is something different.
ross I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
chandler Was that place... The Sun?
ross Oh! And it gets worse!
chandler Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
monica How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
ross How do you count to five?
monica One Two Three...
ross Damnit!
rachel oooh! Oh oh!
ross I Know!
rachel oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
chandler How was your date with Joey?
rachel Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
chandler You didn't like that?
rachel Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
monica Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
rachel I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
monica Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
rachel Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
joey Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second
rachel No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through
monica Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
chandler You don't know!
monica Hey Phoebe!
phoebe Hey!
monica Is Amanda here yet?
phoebe No.
monica Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
phoebe Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
monica Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
phoebe Are you kidding, I love it!
phoebe Hi!
monica Hi!
amanda Hi!
amanda Hello!
amanda It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
monica Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
amanda Smell my neck! It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
phoebe Musty!
amanda Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
monica When were we not friends?
amanda Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel
monica Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
amanda No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
monica You were going to cut me out?
phoebe Well...kinda.
monica Oh My God!
amanda Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
phoebe Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
monica Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
phoebe Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
monica Nope!
joey Hey!
rachel Hey! Got champagne?
joey Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
rachel Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through..
joey Uh!
rachel Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
joey Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
rachel Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
joey Oh! yeah!
rachel You like that? Let's take this into high gear
joey uh uh!
rachel Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
joey No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
rachel What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
joey Soldier down!
monica We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
chandler If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
phoebe Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
monica I have nothing to say to you.
amanda Wow, my flat is twice this size!
phoebe Please, Monica? In the hall?
amanda Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
chandler Well, aren't you a treat.
monica I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
phoebe It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
monica I'm still all those things!
phoebe You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
monica I am scrappy.
phoebe Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
monica It's because I'm scrappy.
phoebe Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
monica I won't know what I would do without you.
monica Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
phoebe Yeah, I guess you're right.
amanda Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
glenda Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
ross I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
glenda Okay...
ross Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
ross Which... which... which... Which one is it?
ross OH! SON OF A BITCH!
rachel What is the matter with us?
joey Well, I know what's the matter with me.
rachel No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
joey I don't know.
chandler That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
rachel Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
chandler Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
rachel No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
joey Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
chandler Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
chandler I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
rachel Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
joey Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
rachel Right, totally.
joey Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
rachel Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
joey That's a... pla-an.
joey Wow... I did not see this coming.
rachel I know. Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
rachel Hmmm... Me too...
rachel I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
joey I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
rachel Aah... I bet you're right.
joey So...
rachel Yeah.
joey I love ya.
rachel Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
joey Yeah, me too.
joey Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
chandler Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
ross Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
chandler I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
ross Really? Did you count Mississipily?
ross Dude, you're not tanned.
chandler No, I just had to get a picture of this.
chandler I see you later!
