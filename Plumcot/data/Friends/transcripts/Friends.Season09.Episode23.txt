joey_tribbiani Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
joey_tribbiani Mmh-mmh.
dr_ross_geller Can you say Barbados?
joey_tribbiani Barbados!
dr_ross_geller Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
rachel_green Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
chandler_bing Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
phoebe_buffay I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
dr_ross_geller Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
phoebe_buffay No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
dr_ross_geller Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
dr_ross_geller It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
charlie_wheeler Wow! This place is beautiful!
dr_ross_geller Look at all these paleontologists!!
joey_tribbiani I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode23 Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
joey_tribbiani I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode23 Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
joey_tribbiani That... never happens...
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode23 I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
dr_ross_geller Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode23 I would love your autograph.
dr_ross_geller Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..."
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode23 Sarah.
dr_ross_geller "... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
sarah Thank you so much!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
sarah Are you a paleontologist?
joey_tribbiani No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
dr_ross_geller Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
joey_tribbiani Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
sarah I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
joey_tribbiani You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
monica_geller David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
david Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
monica_geller See?
chandler_bing Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
monica_geller Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
phoebe_buffay Mike?? Who's Mike?
david Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
phoebe_buffay That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
david It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
phoebe_buffay Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
chandler_bing She does?
monica_geller Let's get you out of here!!
monica_geller At least you took me down with you!
phoebe_buffay I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
monica_geller I guess, in time.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
phoebe_buffay You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
david Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
chandler_bing I wouldn't read too much into it.
david Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
chandler_bing David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
david Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
chandler_bing Seriously, we're gonna do this?
david I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
chandler_bing Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
david That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
chandler_bing What?
david Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
chandler_bing I didn't mean now...
david Why not? It's brilliant! Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
chandler_bing Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
david How do you think I should propose?
chandler_bing David, I'm pretending to read here!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
charlie_wheeler I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
joey_tribbiani You really should have been more clear about that!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
joey_tribbiani Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
charlie_wheeler Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
dr_ross_geller Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
joey_tribbiani You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"
dr_ross_geller Ready to go?
charlie_wheeler Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
charlie_wheeler Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
charlie_wheeler But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
joey_tribbiani Will you wear a thong?
charlie_wheeler I will if you will.
joey_tribbiani Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
dr_ross_geller I'm good, I have dinner plans
charlie_wheeler So you'll be ok?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
dr_ross_geller Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
joey_tribbiani No, why?
joey_tribbiani Oh man!
charlie_wheeler There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
joey_tribbiani I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
monica_geller Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
chandler_bing I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" "I do".
monica_geller Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
chandler_bing David is going to propose to Phoebe.
monica_geller What? Why?
chandler_bing Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
monica_geller Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
chandler_bing I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
monica_geller They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
chandler_bing Man, that's some bad advice!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
rachel_green Hey! Hey what's going on?
joey_tribbiani Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
rachel_green Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
monica_geller Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
chandler_bing That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
joey_tribbiani Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in
monica_geller Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
phoebe_buffay Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
monica_geller And make sure our room isn't next to theirs
rachel_green Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.
phoebe_buffay Not Joey.
rachel_green Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
monica_geller Yeah, right!
david So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.
chandler_bing Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
david Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
chandler_bing Nice!
chandler_bing Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
monica_geller Ok!
chandler_bing David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
monica_geller See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
chandler_bing That would be advice!!
monica_geller Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
monica_geller I need to talk to you.
phoebe_buffay Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
monica_geller Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
phoebe_buffay Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
monica_geller What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." You know, it's every girl's dream!
monica_geller Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
phoebe_buffay Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
dr_ross_geller By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
charlie_wheeler It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
dr_ross_geller Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys!
dr_ross_geller The chocolates aren't here yet.
joey_tribbiani Damnit!
charlie_wheeler Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
chandler_bing Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
dr_ross_geller If you want to check your email, just ask!
chandler_bing What? May I?
rachel_green What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
charlie_wheeler Actually the wet season is June to December.
rachel_green It's not the time Charlie.
chandler_bing Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
joey_tribbiani Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
chandler_bing Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
dr_ross_geller Wha... what do you mean?
chandler_bing It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
dr_ross_geller What, oh my God. What did you do?
chandler_bing Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
dr_ross_geller Why, why would you open it?
chandler_bing Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
dr_ross_geller What did it say?
chandler_bing Nude..... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
dr_ross_geller What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
chandler_bing It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
dr_ross_geller NO! I don't!!
chandler_bing Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
joey_tribbiani It's really gone?
dr_ross_geller Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
chandler_bing I just feel awful.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
chandler_bing Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
dr_ross_geller Get out!
rachel_green You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
dr_ross_geller Well, what do you do?
rachel_green Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
joey_tribbiani I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
dr_ross_geller I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
charlie_wheeler Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
dr_ross_geller Wha... what you really think we can do that?
charlie_wheeler Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner
joey_tribbiani Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
rachel_green Ugh.
dr_ross_geller Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
joey_tribbiani Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"?
mike_hannigan Hello?
monica_geller Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
mike_hannigan Who is this?
monica_geller This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
mike_hannigan He... he's gonna propose?
monica_geller I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
mike_hannigan Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
monica_geller You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
monica_geller Well, I hope you're happy!
chandler_bing Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
monica_geller Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
chandler_bing Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
monica_geller No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
chandler_bing And there's not chance that will work?
monica_geller No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
chandler_bing Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
monica_geller Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
chandler_bing This vacation sucks!!
joey_tribbiani I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
rachel_green Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
joey_tribbiani Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
joey_tribbiani Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
waiter#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode23 I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
rachel_green We can't. We're not pharmacists!
joey_tribbiani I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba...
rachel_green Kate Miller?
joey_tribbiani Kate Miller it is.
rachel_green And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
joey_tribbiani In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
rachel_green Thank you.
charlie_wheeler And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that's it?
charlie_wheeler Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, we did it!
charlie_wheeler Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
dr_ross_geller Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace.
charlie_wheeler Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
charlie_wheeler Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, I love you.
charlie_wheeler Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
dr_ross_geller That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
charlie_wheeler Your first marriage?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
charlie_wheeler You're married more than once?
dr_ross_geller No.
charlie_wheeler So, why did you break up?
dr_ross_geller Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
charlie_wheeler Oh my God, this is so cool!
dr_ross_geller Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
charlie_wheeler No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
dr_ross_geller Hey! High-five!
charlie_wheeler Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
dr_ross_geller My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
charlie_wheeler Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along"
dr_ross_geller I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
charlie_wheeler I know!
dr_ross_geller And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
charlie_wheeler I didn't do that.
dr_ross_geller Me neither.
joey_tribbiani Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
rachel_green I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
joey_tribbiani Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
rachel_green Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
joey_tribbiani But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
rachel_green No.
joey_tribbiani There it is, you're blushing!
rachel_green No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
joey_tribbiani You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
rachel_green No.
joey_tribbiani Tell me who it is.
rachel_green Joey!
joey_tribbiani Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
rachel_green Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
joey_tribbiani What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
rachel_green Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, who is that?
rachel_green Do ya?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
charlie_wheeler@dr_ross_geller Hey!
charlie_wheeler I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
joey_tribbiani Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
dr_ross_geller Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
charlie_wheeler I had a great time.
joey_tribbiani Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
rachel_green Later! La...
charlie_wheeler So, shall we?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Ok. See you, bye.
charlie_wheeler Bye.
dr_ross_geller Good night.
joey_tribbiani Night.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Ok, good night!
monica_geller I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
chandler_bing You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
david Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
monica_geller Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
chandler_bing I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
david Uh, Phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
phoebe_buffay Sure, ok, yeah.
david But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, Mike!
david It's David, actually!
phoebe_buffay No, Mike's here.
david Hi Mike!
mike_hannigan Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
monica_geller IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
mike_hannigan Hi Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay What are you, what are you doing here?
mike_hannigan I have a question I need to ask you.
david I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
mike_hannigan Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
david Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
mike_hannigan Actually yeah, that'll be great.
david That's fair, you've had a long trip.
mike_hannigan Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
david Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
mike_hannigan Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
david Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
monica_geller You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...
david I have a ring.
chandler_bing I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
david Phoebe, will you marry me?
phoebe_buffay No!
david Uhm... Ha ha!
phoebe_buffay I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
mike_hannigan We can have any future you want.
david Ok, I'm gonna take off.
phoebe_buffay David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
david Just so I know, if I had asked first...
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
david Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!
mike_hannigan Is it ok if I hug you now?
phoebe_buffay Yes!
monica_geller BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
