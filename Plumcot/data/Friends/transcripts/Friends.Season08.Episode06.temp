phoebe My mother killed herself.
eric She, now I knew that and...now I'm sweating. Look at me, I'm really sweating-Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.

eric Eric.
phoebe Why are you looking at me like that?
eric 'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.

phoebe I love the second grade!

eric Y'know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me
phoebe No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.

chandler Oh! Hi!
mona Hi!
chandler Joey's gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.

eric Hey beautiful.
phoebe Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
eric Two weeks ago.
phoebe Two weeks? That's it?
eric Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it's not like me to do something so impulsive, but she's just so perfect, and we have so much in common.
phoebe Oh really?
eric We're both teachers.
phoebe Huh?
eric And we were both in the Peace Corps.
phoebe Peace Corps, really?
eric In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
ursula Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. Shall we get me really drunk?
eric Sure.
chandler Howdy doody.
ross That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
chandler Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
joey Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
chandler What question?
joey Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
chandler There's no question.
joey So you think Ross too?
chandler You picked Ross?!
monica Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.
chandler I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
ross Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
chandler Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
ross Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
monica Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
joey Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
mona Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
joey Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
chandler You're going down.
ross Oh yeah? You're going further down! Downtown!
joey Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.

gunther Really?
rachel Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
kid Trick or treat!
rachel Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
boy_in_the_cape My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
rachel Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
boy_in_the_cape I'd rather have the money.
rachel Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
boy_in_the_cape This isn't fair.
rachel Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
boy_in_the_cape Shut up!
rachel You shut up!
boy_in_the_cape You can't tell me to shut up!
rachel Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!

boy_in_the_cape You're a mean old woman.
rachel No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook!
monica Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
chandler That means nothing to me. Come on!
phoebe Hi liar!
ursula Hey!
phoebe Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
ursula Well they could be true.
phoebe But they're not!
ursula Yeah, it's a fine line huh?
phoebe Why are you lying to him?
ursula I don't know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
eric Honey?
ursula It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
eric She's helped so many people to quit smoking.
ursula Y'know, we'd really better get going.
eric Oh right, you've got a church group meeting tonight.
ursula Right.
eric Well, it was nice meeting you.
phoebe You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
joey Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
ross Pride.
chandler And dignity.
joey Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
mona Wow! They're both really strong.
joey Or equally weak.
monica Oh God!
phoebe Hmm?
monica Chandler's making his sex face.
ross So, you gettin' tired?
chandler Nope! I can do this all day.
ross Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
chandler God, I'm exhausted.
ross Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
chandler No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
ross Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
chandler You're Spudnik.
ross Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
chandler Fine. Oh no!
ross Oh yeah!
mona Yay! My hero!
joey You're a weird lady.
eric Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
phoebe Oh.
eric What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
phoebe Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
eric Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding.
phoebe Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
eric I think we'll be okay. Besides it's so perfect and she's been saving herself for me.
phoebe Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
eric What?
phoebe She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
eric She told me she was 25.
phoebe Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger.
eric I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
phoebe No. You're not, you're not stupid.
eric I'm not smart. I just wanted so much to...be impulsive once. To be romantic.
phoebe That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
eric It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
ursula Eric!! Let's go!!
eric I'd better go, deal
phoebe Yeah, you should.
ursula Hurry up I gotta pray!!
joey Hey!
rachel Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
joey That's not so bad.
rachel No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
joey Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
rachel Really? You think that's all it is?
joey Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
monica Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
chandler Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
monica Is that a secret or a lie.
chandler No, I let him win-Ross!
ross Yeah?
chandler Would you tell her I let you win please?
ross Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!
chandler I am strong! I'll show you!
monica Chandler please!
chandler Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
monica Let's go big bunny!
chandler Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
