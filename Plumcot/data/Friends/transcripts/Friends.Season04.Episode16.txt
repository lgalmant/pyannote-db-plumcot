monica_geller What is it hon?
phoebe_buffay I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
monica_geller Aww, honey I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
chandler_bing Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
phoebe_buffay It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
joey_tribbiani Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
phoebe_buffay No!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
joey_tribbiani Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
chandler_bing What are you writing?
rachel_green Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
chandler_bing Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
chandler_bing Hi guys!
all@ Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey, what have you guys been up too?
dr_ross_geller Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
chandler_bing Without me?!
emily_waltham My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
emily_waltham They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
monica_geller I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
emily_waltham I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
dr_ross_geller Bye.
emily_waltham Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
joey_tribbiani Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
monica_geller Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
joey_tribbiani Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
chandler_bing Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs!
all@ Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hello! Hello!
phoebe_buffay Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
chandler_bing Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
phoebe_buffay Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
joey_tribbiani Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
phoebe_buffay That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
joshua_burgin Okay!
rachel_green Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
joshua_burgin Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
rachel_green Yeah?
joshua_burgin Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
rachel_green Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
joshua_burgin Why not?!
rachel_green Well, that's because of a lot of
joshua_burgin Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
rachel_green I know!
joshua_burgin Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
rachel_green Oh?
joshua_burgin Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
rachel_green Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
joshua_burgin No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
rachel_green Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
joshua_burgin Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
rachel_green Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
joshua_burgin Then uh, what's-what's this?
rachel_green You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
rachel_green Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
chandler_bing What are you talking about?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, what' going on?
rachel_green We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
dr_ross_geller Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
joey_tribbiani Awwww!
emily_waltham Hello?
rachel_green Surprise!!!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Surprise!!
emily_waltham No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
rachel_green Well, it was all Ross's idea.
emily_waltham You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
dr_ross_geller You really didn't know?
chandler_bing Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
rachel_green Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
chandler_bing Like what?
joey_tribbiani What-what-what is so funny?
chandler_bing I said, "Like what?"
joey_tribbiani Now that's a thinker.
rachel_green Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
joshua_burgin Hi!
rachel_green Care for a cherry?
joshua_burgin Oh, no thanks.
rachel_green No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
joshua_burgin You okay? You all right?
dr_ross_geller So we should probably get going soon.
emily_waltham Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
emily_waltham So why did you plan a party at the same time?
dr_ross_geller No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
emily_waltham But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
dr_ross_geller Monica said that did she?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
joey_tribbiani A little salami.
phoebe_buffay Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
joey_tribbiani Pastrami.
phoebe_buffay Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
rachel_green Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Up!
monica_geller You changed?
rachel_green Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
monica_geller And lucky means, more cleavage?
chandler_bing Does for me.
rachel_green Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
joey_tribbiani Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani There was a seen in Footloose...
chandler_bing Flashdance.
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl
chandler_bing She was a welder.
joey_tribbiani What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
monica_geller Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
rachel_green It's not Christmas!
monica_geller Or Spin the Bottle?
rachel_green He's not 11!
emily_waltham Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
rachel_green What? You're leaving?!
dr_ross_geller Yes, we have something we have to get to.
joshua_burgin Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
rachel_green No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
dr_ross_geller What big thing?
rachel_green So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. All right. Who wants to go first?
emily_waltham I'll go.
all@ Yay!
joey_tribbiani Welcome to America.
monica_geller Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
rachel_green Yay! Emily!
chandler_bing What are the odds? What are the odds?
dr_ross_geller Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
joey_tribbiani If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
rachel_green Okay, my turn!!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
all@ Ohh!
rachel_green It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
all@ Oh my God!
rachel_green All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
rachel_green Just a bug.
phoebe_buffay Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
chandler_bing Okay.
chandler_bing There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
joey_tribbiani Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
phoebe_buffay I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
joey_tribbiani All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, totally!
joey_tribbiani All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
joey_tribbiani Feel better now?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
joey_tribbiani Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
phoebe_buffay Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
joey_tribbiani Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
dr_ross_geller Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
emily_waltham But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
monica_geller Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
rachel_green No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
monica_geller Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
joshua_burgin Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
joshua_burgin Nice uh, costume.
rachel_green Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
all@ E!
rachel_green Gimme an 'M!'
all@ M!
rachel_green Gimme an 'I!'
all@ I!
rachel_green Gimme an 'L!'
all@ L!
rachel_green Gimme a 'Y!'
all@ Y!
rachel_green What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
joey_tribbiani@monica_geller Are you all right?
rachel_green I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
monica_geller I think you're done.
joey_tribbiani Okay, time to take off the bra.
joshua_burgin Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
joey_tribbiani Take the bra off.
rachel_green All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
joshua_burgin Okay.
gunther Rachel is my girlfriend.
joshua_burgin So, this was uh, really fun.
rachel_green Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
joshua_burgin Need uh, need a little hand there.
rachel_green Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
joshua_burgin You really don't seem like you do. That's
rachel_green Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
joshua_burgin Well, what was supposed to happen?
rachel_green Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
joshua_burgin Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
rachel_green Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
joshua_burgin No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
rachel_green Why?!
joshua_burgin Because I-I like you.
rachel_green You like me?
joshua_burgin Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
rachel_green Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
joshua_burgin But
rachel_green Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
joshua_burgin Okay uh, however
rachel_green Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
joshua_burgin My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
rachel_green But....
joshua_burgin I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
rachel_green Okay.
rachel_green Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
dr_ross_geller That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
rachel_green Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
dr_ross_geller Helps a little.
rachel_green Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, have a seat.
rachel_green I'm so sorry.
dr_ross_geller That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
rachel_green Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
dr_ross_geller What do you mean?
rachel_green You seem to really like her.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
rachel_green Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
dr_ross_geller You think?
rachel_green Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you're right.
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. What photo album was it?
rachel_green I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
rachel_green Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
rachel_green You're a pathetic loser, right?
chandler_bing Oh-ho, yeah!
rachel_green Sit!
joshua_burgin Hi.
rachel_green Oh my gosh, Joshua!
joshua_burgin All those things I said about not being ready
rachel_green They're not true?
joshua_burgin No, they're-they're all true.
rachel_green Oh.
joshua_burgin But
rachel_green Oh! Oh, I love that but.
rachel_green You wanna go inside and have some coffee?

rachel_green Okay. Every time.
joey_tribbiani Oooh, what you got there?
phoebe_buffay Pastrami.
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
phoebe_buffay Hm-mm, corn beef.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
phoebe_buffay Okay.
joey_tribbiani Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
phoebe_buffay Six months.
joey_tribbiani Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
phoebe_buffay Not if I get there first.
