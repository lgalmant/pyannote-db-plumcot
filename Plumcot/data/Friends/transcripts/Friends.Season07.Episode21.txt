monica_geller Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
chandler_bing Do you realize you get louder each week?
monica_geller There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
chandler_bing I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
monica_geller Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
chandler_bing Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
monica_geller No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
chandler_bing Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
monica_geller Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
chandler_bing Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
chandler_bing Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
joey_tribbiani All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
dr_ross_geller Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
chandler_bing I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
rachel_green Monica what?
phoebe_buffay What?!
rachel_green What is the emergency?!
monica_geller You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
rachel_green Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
monica_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
monica_geller Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
dr_ross_geller ..everyone, this is Chandler!
monica_geller Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
chandler_bing Okay.
rachel_green Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
chandler_bing All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
monica_geller Ennnh.
monica_geller Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
phoebe_buffay Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
monica_geller Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
chandler_bing There are seven?! That's one?
monica_geller It's kind of an important one!
chandler_bing Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
rachel_green Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
monica_geller All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7..7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
joey_tribbiani Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
chandler_bing Monica
joey_tribbiani "...when I look back over our time together..."
chandler_bing Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
monica_geller No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
chandler_bing You'll get one.
monica_geller Oh yeah? When?
chandler_bing All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
monica_geller Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler_bing Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
monica_geller Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler_bing No, no, no.
monica_geller What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
chandler_bing Uh, uh.
monica_geller Well?
chandler_bing Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
dr_ross_geller I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
monica_geller Do you think he knew I was here?
chandler_bing Nice try.
monica_geller Wait, wait, wait!
chandler_bing Look, Monica
monica_geller Look!
chandler_bing This is not going to work.
monica_geller I bet this will work!
chandler_bing You are so great! I love you!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
monica_geller You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
chandler_bing No I didn't!
monica_geller Yes, you did!
chandler_bing No I didn't!
monica_geller You love me!
chandler_bing No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
chandler_bing Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
monica_geller Then all your stuff would be here.
chandler_bing Well, what if all my stuff was here?
monica_geller Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
chandler_bing Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
monica_geller You wanted it to be a surprise.
chandler_bing Oh my God.
monica_geller Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
chandler_bing Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
monica_geller Yes.
joey_tribbiani Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
monica_geller Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey, what have you guys been up to?
dr_ross_geller Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
joey_tribbiani How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
dr_ross_geller How's Monica coming along with her vows?
phoebe_buffay Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
phoebe_buffay Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
dr_ross_geller Phoebe that's not true.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
rachel_green I can't believe they've been together for three years.
joey_tribbiani Has it been that long?!
dr_ross_geller Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
chandler_bing I've had a very long, hard day.
joey_tribbiani Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
chandler_bing Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
chandler_bing Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
monica_geller Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
chandler_bing Hey Joe!
chandler_bing Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
rachel_green I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
joey_tribbiani I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
joey_tribbiani You?! And-and you?!
monica_geller Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
joey_tribbiani How?! When?!
chandler_bing It happened in London.
joey_tribbiani IN LONDON!!!
chandler_bing The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
joey_tribbiani But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
chandler_bing No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
monica_geller Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
joey_tribbiani All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
monica_geller I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
chandler_bing Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
monica_geller Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
rachel_green Arghh!!
phoebe_buffay Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
rachel_green Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
rachel_green OH MY GOD!!!
phoebe_buffay OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
rachel_green Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
phoebe_buffay NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
rachel_green I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
phoebe_buffay YOU KNOW?!!!
rachel_green Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Ohhh!!!
rachel_green HI!! Hi!
dr_ross_geller What?! What?!
rachel_green Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
dr_ross_geller Actually, it looks really good.
phoebe_buffay Get in here!!!
phoebe_buffay Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
joey_tribbiani Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
phoebe_buffay Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
rachel_green All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
monica_geller Bye!
all@ Bye!
phoebe_buffay Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
chandler_bing Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
monica_geller Actually, I did!
chandler_bing Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
monica_geller Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
chandler_bing Phoebe knows about us!
joey_tribbiani Well I didn't tell them!
monica_geller Them?! Who's them?
joey_tribbiani Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
monica_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
monica_geller Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
chandler_bing Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
phoebe_buffay I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
rachel_green Are you kidding?!
phoebe_buffay No!
rachel_green I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
joey_tribbiani No.
rachel_green Joey!
joey_tribbiani They know you know.
rachel_green Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
phoebe_buffay God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
joey_tribbiani I couldn't even if I wanted too.
chandler_bing Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
monica_geller She's bluffing!
chandler_bing Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
phoebe_buffay He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
joey_tribbiani Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
rachel_green Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
joey_tribbiani Ooh!
rachel_green Okay!
joey_tribbiani I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
phoebe_buffay Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
joey_tribbiani It's not my first time.
monica_geller You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
chandler_bing Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
monica_geller Of course.
chandler_bing Oh, you're-you're going?
phoebe_buffay Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
chandler_bing It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
phoebe_buffay You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
chandler_bing Not if I kiss you first.
phoebe_buffay Ooh.
chandler_bing Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
phoebe_buffay Here it comes. Our first kiss.
chandler_bing Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
phoebe_buffay And why not?!
chandler_bing Because I'm in love with Monica!!
phoebe_buffay You're-you're what?!
chandler_bing Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
monica_geller I love you too Chandler.
phoebe_buffay I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
joey_tribbiani So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
monica_geller Well actually, Ross doesn't.
chandler_bing Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
dr_ross_geller No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
phoebe_buffay Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
rachel_green You really think it would be that different?
phoebe_buffay How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
rachel_green Well, things change.
joey_tribbiani I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
dr_ross_geller It'll be okay Joe.
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
rachel_green Hey, who's this little naked guy?
dr_ross_geller That little naked guy would be me.
rachel_green Aww, look at the little thing.
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
chandler_bing Who are those people?
dr_ross_geller Got me.
monica_geller Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
rachel_green Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
monica_geller Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
dr_ross_geller Looks like a fun gang.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
dr_ross_geller Nono, that would be me again.
monica_geller Hey, you guys!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing What's going on?
rachel_green Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
monica_geller Oh that's so sweet.
chandler_bing So we both finished our vows.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Oh, can we read them?
monica_geller Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
phoebe_buffay Oh, that's beautiful.
joey_tribbiani Funny one! That's good!
rachel_green Monica, will-will you marry me?
joey_tribbiani What? I don't get it.
dr_ross_geller Oh man, this is hilarious.
monica_geller Chandler!!
chandler_bing Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
chandler_bing Okay, what do you guys think?
dr_ross_geller Dude!
joey_tribbiani I have never known love like this.
chandler_bing You really like it?
dr_ross_geller Dude! How-how did you write this?
chandler_bing I stole Monica's and changed the name.
dr_ross_geller You can't do that!
joey_tribbiani If he goes first he can!
