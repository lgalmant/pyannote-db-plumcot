joey Okay, pick a card.
chandler Okay.
joey All right now, memorize it. You got it?
chandler Oh yes.
joey Is that your card?
chandler Yes.
carol Hey guys!
ross Hi!
chandler Hi there!
ben Hi!!
carol Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
phoebe What are you talking about?!
ross Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
joey Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
ross I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
joey I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
chandler That.
rachel Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
joey Luck!
chandler Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
rachel Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
chandler Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
monica Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
rachel Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
all Good luck! Go get 'em!
phoebe Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
joey Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
phoebe Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
monica I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
joey Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
ross Okay!!
joey Done.
phoebe Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
monica I would love to do it together!
joey They're gonna do it together.
chandler Dude! That's my girlfriend!
joey What, so I gotta shut it down now?
ross All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
monica It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
ross Yeah.
chandler Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
joey Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
ross Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
joey Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
ross You're not his godfather.
joey What?! Are you kidding?!
ross Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
joey All right!
joey Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
ross Really? That's great!
joey I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
carol Hey, that kid looks familiar.
joey Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad... .
ross Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
joey That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
ross Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
joey I look more like him than you do!
carol Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
kim So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
rachel Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
kim Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
nancy She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
rachel Oh, what a fun office.
kim I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
kim Rachel? Do you smoke?
rachel Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories... ... about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
rachel and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
monica That doesn't seem fair.
rachel I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
chandler Yeah, it is the best.
rachel I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
monica Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
rachel Yeah, I can do that.
chandler Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
rachel I would love to!
phoebe Oh good!
chandler Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
phoebe Oh good.
phoebe Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
monica Yeah, me too!
phoebe Oh, look at that.
monica All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
phoebe What happened to the intimate dinner party?
monica Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
phoebe So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
monica What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
phoebe Like what?
monica Cups.
phoebe Cups? You're giving me cups?
monica And ice!
phoebe Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
monica Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
phoebe I got it! Mine!
ross Hi.
monica Hey! How'd the audition go?!
ross Not so good.
monica Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
ross Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
joey Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
monica You got a callback too didn't you?
joey Yeah I did!
kim Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
rachel Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
kim Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
rachel Oh great!
kim So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
nancy Oh, sorry!
rachel Oh that's okay.
kim No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
nancy So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
kim Oh that's great! You are the best!
rachel Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
nancy I thought you didn't smoke.
rachel Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
kim We get high.
rachel Oh, me too.
kim I'm kidding.
rachel Oh, me too.
ross Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
joey Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
carol Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
joey Who knows?
the_casting_director Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
ross Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
joey Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
ross Yeah!
the_casting_director Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
joey Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
ross Yeah, it is.
kyle Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
ross No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
kyle Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
phoebe Hey!
ross_and_chandler Hi!
phoebe Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
chandler Ah sure. What's in 'em?
phoebe Umm, cups.
chandler Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
ross Seriously that's a lot of cups.
phoebe Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
chandler Y'know I rued the day once... didn't get a whole lot else done.
phoebe Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
joey Hey Pheebs! Hey!
ross Hey!
joey Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
ross What's up?
joey Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
ross Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
joey That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
ross Well, you just
joey I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
ross What?!
joey What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
chandler Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
ross Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
joey At least I care about his feelings!
ross What?!
joey Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
ross And why wouldn't he get it?
joey Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
ross Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
joey You just give him a spoon baby!
ross Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
joey Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
ross You're kid's name is Raymond!
joey Yeah?! So's yours!
monica How did work go?
rachel Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
monica You stink!
rachel Thanks!
monica No, I'm-I'm serious!
rachel Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
chandler Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
rachel I did not!
chandler Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
rachel All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
chandler I wish I had smoked for my career
monica That's so gross!
rachel No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
chandler Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
monica Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
chandler I think you smell great!
kim So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
nancy Absolutely!
rachel I am so on board!
kim Rachel didn't you just light that?
rachel Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
nancy I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
kim Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
nancy Tell me about it!
rachel Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
kim It does sound appealing.
nancy Oh, I never could do it.
rachel Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
kim Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
rachel Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
kim My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
rachel Okay then!
joey Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
carol Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
joey Oh yeah, no problem.
carol Thanks.
joey Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
ross Joey!
joey Ross!
ross Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
the_casting_director Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
joey Hi!
the_casting_director Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
joey Uh-oh.
the_casting_director Is there a problem?
joey Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
the_casting_director Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
joey Oh, what did I say?
the_casting_director Hmm, noodle soup.
joey How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
the_casting_director All right, let's try one.
joey Hmm, noodle soup.
the_casting_director Okay. Let's do it again.
joey Okay.
joey Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
raymond COME ON!!!!

joey No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
rachel Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
kim Uh-oh, busted!
rachel Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
kim Yeah. That didn't work out.
nancy Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
rachel Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
kim No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
rachel Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
kim Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
rachel Okay.
kim So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
rachel Oh man!
phoebe Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
chandler Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
monica Why don't you just go out with her!
phoebe And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
chandler Awesome!
monica Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
chandler There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
monica Y'know... go! Go! Right there!
chandler Thank you! Thank you!
phoebe Oh, look! Look! Look!
all Surprise!!
rachel What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
monica That's the surprise!
rachel Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
all Surprise!
rachel Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
phoebe I was in charge of cups.
rachel Oh, okay, not so weird.
ross Hey!
joey Hey.
ross Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
joey Yeah right!
ross No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
joey Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
ross Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
joey What you do mean?
ross I think, sub-consciously
joey Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
ross I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
joey Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
ross No!
joey No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
ross There you go. Thank you!
joey Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
ross No.
joey Eh, what are you gonna do?
chandler Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
kim Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
chandler Okay, great.
kim So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
chandler I'll catch you guys later.
