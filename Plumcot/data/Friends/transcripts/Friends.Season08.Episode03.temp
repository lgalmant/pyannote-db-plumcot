chandler Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
monica Yeah I am!
chandler Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
monica That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
joey Hey!
phoebe Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
chandler I'd better go pack.
monica Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
chandler A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
rachel Oh good you're still here!
monica Hey!
rachel I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
monica Thank you.
rachel And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
joey We know its Ross!
rachel How?! How do you know?
phoebe It was his sweater, but-Oh my God!
rachel Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
monica This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
rachel I know!
phoebe Me too!
joey I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
rachel You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
monica Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
rachel Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
monica Well, what were you gonna say?
rachel Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
joey Well that, that sounds good.
rachel Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
monica Hey! Good luck!
phoebe Yeah, bye.
joey Bye.
chandler Hey, what was that all about?
monica Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
chandler What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
monica I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
chandler What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
joey What secrets?
chandler Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
joey You'll tell me later?
chandler You already know.
phoebe Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
joey Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
phoebe All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
joey I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
phoebe What?! They took mine to give to you!
joey Why would they take away our keys?
phoebe Maybe they don't trust us.
joey No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
phoebe You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
joey Hey, I washed those!
phoebe No you didn't.
joey Yeah that didn't sound like me.
phoebe Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
joey Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
phoebe What stuff?
joey Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
ross Hey!
phoebe Did Rachel find you?
ross No why?
phoebe Oh she was looking for you.
ross Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
phoebe Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
joey Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
ross Oh no.
phoebe What?
ross I think I might know what this is about.
joey Really?
ross Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
phoebe And?
ross Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
phoebe Oh sorry. And?!
ross Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
joey Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
ross Why? What-what else could it be?
joey Oh wow, I don't feel well.
ross I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
phoebe Maybe it's something you ate?
joey Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
ross Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.
ticket_agent Next?
monica They're kissing let's just go around them.
chandler Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
monica I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
ticket_agent Next?
monica Hi! Can you do that and walk? 'Cause she said, "Next."
woman Sorry. We didn't hear you; we're on our honeymoon.
ticket_agent Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available.
monica Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
chandler We are on our honeymoon.
monica Grab my ass!
ticket_agent Next?
monica Hi, sorry. I almost didn't hear you, because y'know I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.
ticket_agent Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you'll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you'll be in 25K.
monica Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
ticket_agent I'm sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
monica You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!
chandler 25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
joey I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
phoebe Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
joey What the hell is that?
joey Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
mr_treeger You said there was a gas leak in here.
phoebe Well why don't you use your key?
mr_treeger Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up.
phoebe Oh! We could have done that.
monica Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
chandler No.
monica Me neither! We have to get in!
chandler Just act like you belong.
monica Oh my God! Oranges!
chandler Shh! Nice to see you again.
airline_employee Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
chandler Yes, of course.
airline_employee I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.
chandler Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
airline_employee Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
chandler Apology accepted. Excuse us.
airline_employee Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
monica Fine. Go! Go! Go!
rachel Hi!
ross Hi.
rachel Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
ross I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here.
rachel You do?
ross Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
rachel Okay.
ross Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
rachel What?
ross I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
rachel Seriously. What?!
ross Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
rachel Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
ross Oh sure.
rachel I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that
rachel Can I get you some water?
ross I'm good. I'm good.
rachel Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
ross Yeah, I need uh... I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
rachel I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
ross What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
rachel They do!
ross No they don't!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
rachel Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
ross Oh well I may as well have!
rachel Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out
ross Freaked out? Hey no, I'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
rachel Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
ross No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
rachel Okay, y'know maybe I should come back
ross Shh! Shh! Shh!
rachel Okay.
ross Yeah I'll press 1!
mr_treeger I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
joey Huh. So then I can heat this up?
mr_treeger Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
phoebe Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
mr_treeger Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
phoebe Oh no.
mr_treeger Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross!
ross Hi.
mr_treeger Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
ross Sure.
mr_treeger Namaste.
ross Namaste.
ross Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
joey So it's noticeable huh?
ross Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
phoebe Didn't you two already talk?
ross Yeah but uh... Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else. Rachel's pregnant.
joey Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
phoebe Holy mother of God!!!
ross With my child.
phoebe That is brand new information!!
ross You already know don't you?
phoebe A little bit.
joey How are you doing?
ross Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
joey Well, what did you say to her?
ross Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
phoebe Oh Ross.
ross But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
joey What?
ross I gotta go find her.
joey Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
ross Evidently they do.
joey What?!
monica I can't believe we're here.
chandler Oh you've got to be kidding me.
monica What?
front_desk_clerk As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
monica No!! You have been screwing us all day!
man Who are you?
chandler We're you just ten seconds later!
monica Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
woman Well you can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay. We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
chandler We need the stuff.
joey Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
monica What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
chandler What else is new?
joey Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
monica Well do something! Get in there!
joey How? I guess I could break down your door.
monica Yeah! Do that!
joey And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
monica No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
joey Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down.
phoebe Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
nurse Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
rachel If I said I was, would you judge me?
nurse The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
rachel Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn
ross Hi!
rachel Hi!
ross Uh we-we need to talk.
rachel Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
ross Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
rachel Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
ross What? Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really-I should have been thinking about you Rach
rachel Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
ross Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
rachel What married?
ross Well yeah, I think we should get married.
rachel What, because that's your answer to everything?
ross No, because that's the right thing to do.
rachel Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
ross No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
rachel Excuse me?
ross Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
rachel What?!
ross I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
rachel I can too eat by myself!
ross When have you ever?
rachel When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
ross Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
rachel Oh please, you inhale your food!
ross I grew up with Monica! If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
dr_long Am I interrupting?
rachel Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
ross But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
dr_long Huh. Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
ross I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
rachel I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
dr_long Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
ross Oh my God.
rachel Wow. There it is, I see it.
dr_long Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
rachel Okay.
ross Thank you.
ross Pretty amazing huh?
rachel I don't see it!
ross What? What?!
rachel I can't see it!
ross You-you just said that you did!
rachel I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
ross Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it's-it's-it's, it's right there
rachel Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
