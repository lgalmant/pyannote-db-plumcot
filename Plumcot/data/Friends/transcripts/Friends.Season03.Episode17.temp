joey Can I see the comics?
chandler This is the New York Times.
joey Okay, may I see the comics?
monica Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
chandler We are. He's meeting us here.
monica No! Rachel is meeting us here.
phoebe Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
joey Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
phoebe Why? What happened now?
joey Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
chandler Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
joey Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
phoebe Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
joey Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
phoebe Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
chandler Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
phoebe Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
joey I had the same dream!
phoebe Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
joey Oh, I had the opposite dream.
chandler Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
joey Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
monica It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
monica Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
rachel Hey!
monica Let's get the show on it!
rachel Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
monica Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
rachel Closer than here?
phoebe Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
rachel Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
phoebe Okay, your highness.
phoebe Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
rachel Is he here?
chandler No.
rachel Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!

chandler Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
rachel Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
phoebe No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
rachel Hm-mm.
chandler Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
rachel Ohh!
monica We're sorry honey.
rachel Oh, it's okay.
joey Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
rachel And heels.

rachel No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
phoebe Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
joey Oh yeah.
monica Very bad.
phoebe Chandler what are you doing?!
monica Chandler!!
chandler Oh my God!
joey You're smoking again?!
chandler Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
phoebe Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
chandler Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
monica Weren't you nine?!
chandler Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
chandler Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
phoebe Him? Him, Ross?
chandler Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
rachel Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
all Absolutely, yeah!
rachel Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
chandler Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
joey Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
phoebe Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
ross Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
chandler Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
ross Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
joey It'll be great for next weekend.
ross No, no, no, this weekend guys!
joey It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
ross What's going on?
phoebe Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
ross So, for the whole weekend?
monica We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
ross Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
phoebe Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
joey Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
monica Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
ross What a pity stay?
monica No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
ross Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
chandler Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
joey Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
monica Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
chandler Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
joey What? Mine aren't tinted.
phoebe Chandler!!
chandler What?
phoebe What does the sign say?
chandler Beam me up Jesus.
phoebe No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
chandler Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
all Oh!
phoebe Please!
monica No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
chandler Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
joey Oh, now I have to go!!
chandler Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
monica What?
rachel Okay.
monica Ow!
phoebe Aren't you gonna go?
rachel No. Thank you.
monica No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
rachel Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
phoebe No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
chandler Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
joey What's going on?

chandler Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
joey Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
chandler Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
monica So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
joey Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
monica What?!
rachel What?!
joey Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
monica Please!!
joey Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
the_girls No, not getting my bra!
joey If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
phoebe Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
monica These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
rachel What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
monica All right then, your bra would still be big.
rachel No, I stuff outside the bra.
chandler Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
phoebe All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
rachel Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
chandler Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
phoebe Okay, there.
joey Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
chandler Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
joey And there you go!
all Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
monica Chandler!!
chandler At least let me smoke it to the good part.
phoebe Okay. Oh, no!
rachel What, what's it, what's going on?
phoebe Yeah, this has happened before.
rachel So you know how to fix it?
phoebe Yep. Put more gas in.
carol Hi!
ross Hey.
carol Hey, what are you doing here?
ross Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M'A'S'H and half the hostages coming home?
carol Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
ross Where's Ben?
carol He's sleeping.
ross Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
carol Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
ross Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
carol It's not that kind of anniversary.
ross Ah! Oh.
carol Sooo!! Anyway...
ross Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
carol Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
ross Yeah, well.
carol Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
ross Oh yeah, I'd love that.
carol Oh, great! Me too.
ross I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
phoebe Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
rachel Great!
phoebe Yeah, what town are we near?
monica Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
phoebe Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
rachel Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
phoebe Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
rachel I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
phoebe Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
rachel Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
monica Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
rachel No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
phoebe But if...
rachel No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
phoebe Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
monica So the going for help went well?
joey Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
chandler I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
monica Then why are you smoking?
chandler Well it's very unsettling.
ross ...right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
carol Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
ross 717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
carol No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
phoebe Ross, thank God.
ross Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
phoebe I ate a bug.
monica Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
phoebe Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
ross Oh, now you want a favour?
phoebe Yes, please.
ross Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
carol Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
ross No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
carol Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
ross No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
carol Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
ross Yeah, you're right.
carol Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
ross We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
carol You slept with another woman?
ross Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
joey Okay, done.
monica What's 'pleh'?
joey That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
monica Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
rachel Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
phoebe Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
chandler_and_joey Hey!!
phoebe Hi!
rachel What is he doing here?!
ross He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
all No! Come on!
rachel All right!! Fine! Fine.
joey Arrrghh!!
chandler Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
phoebe You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
chandler Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
joey Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
monica I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
rachel Ask me what?
monica Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
chandler_phoebe_and_joey No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
rachel You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
ross Excuse me?
chandler It's horrible.
ross Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
rachel Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
ross Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
monica Here we go again.
joey I-I can't handle this, you guys.
chandler Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
ross All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
rachel All right, let's go!
ross You're welcome.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
ross We were on a break!
rachel Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
ross Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
rachel What?!
monica I don't know.
ross That's what you said last night.
monica What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
ross Okay.
rachel Really Joey?
joey What?
phoebe Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
rachel No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
ross Obviously not to Joey.
joey What?
ross Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
chandler Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
phoebe Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
joey Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
phoebe Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
rachel Yeah.
ross I can.
phoebe Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
joey Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
ross Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
