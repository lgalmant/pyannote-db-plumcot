phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
phoebe_buffay Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
chandler_bing All right.
phoebe_buffay Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
joey_tribbiani Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
phoebe_buffay I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
alice_knight_buffay Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey! What are you doing here?
alice_knight_buffay Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
alice_knight_buffay No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
chandler_bing Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
alice_knight_buffay Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
phoebe_buffay Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
alice_knight_buffay You think about it.
emily_waltham I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
dr_ross_geller Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
emily_waltham Ohh, it's time to go.
dr_ross_geller Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
emily_waltham Well that's ambitious.
dr_ross_geller Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
emily_waltham That's Carol with your son!
dr_ross_geller Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
carol_willick Ross!
dr_ross_geller I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
susan_bunch Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
emily_waltham Me too!
carol_willick Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
susan_bunch Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
emily_waltham Oh, well, I'll show you around.
susan_bunch That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions
emily_waltham Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
susan_bunch Ahh!
dr_ross_geller Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
emily_waltham Are you all right?
susan_bunch Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
dr_ross_geller Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
phoebe_buffay Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
chandler_bing Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
joey_tribbiani Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
phoebe_buffay No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
joey_tribbiani Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
chandler_bing Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
joey_tribbiani Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
chandler_bing Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
joey_tribbiani What do ya say? What do ya say?
phoebe_buffay Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
joey_tribbiani I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
rachel_green Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
monica_geller Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
rachel_green Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
monica_geller Um-hmm.
rachel_green What am I making him by the way?
monica_geller Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
rachel_green I thought I was making him filet mignon?
monica_geller Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
rachel_green Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller So uh, Emily called last night
chandler_bing And now you're giving me the message!
dr_ross_geller Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
phoebe_buffay God, Susan is so fun!
dr_ross_geller Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
chandler_bing You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
dr_ross_geller Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
joey_tribbiani No, but I'm gonna!
chandler_bing Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
dr_ross_geller How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
dr_ross_geller What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
phoebe_buffay No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
dr_ross_geller Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
phoebe_buffay Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know
dr_ross_geller Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
phoebe_buffay So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
chandler_bing Raymond Chandler.
joey_tribbiani Someone you didn't make up!
chandler_bing Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
phoebe_buffay Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
chandler_bing Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
joey_tribbiani All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
chandler_bing Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani So I guess it's Joey then!
joshua_burgin This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
rachel_green Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
joshua_burgin Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
rachel_green Hmmm!
joshua_burgin Oh my God!
rachel_green Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
joshua_burgin Behind you?
rachel_green Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
joshua_burgin Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
rachel_green Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
joey_tribbiani Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
rachel_green All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
joshua_burgin Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
rachel_green Oh.
joshua_burgin So, all right.
rachel_green Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
joshua_burgin Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
rachel_green But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
joshua_burgin Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
rachel_green Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
joshua_burgin Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
rachel_green Your parents'?
joshua_burgin Yeah, they're out of town.
rachel_green Ohh.
joshua_burgin Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
rachel_green Yeah that works.
joshua_burgin They-they-they can smell fear.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
carol_willick Hey! How's Ben?
dr_ross_geller Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
carol_willick Hey, Ben! Hey!
dr_ross_geller So umm, any word from Susan?
carol_willick Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
carol_willick What's too much fun?
dr_ross_geller Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
carol_willick Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
dr_ross_geller Am I?!
carol_willick Yes!
dr_ross_geller Am I?!
carol_willick I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
carol_willick Maybe.
dr_ross_geller OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
joshua_burgin ...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
rachel_green Wow! This place is fabulous!
joshua_burgin Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
rachel_green Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
joshua_burgin Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
rachel_green Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
joshua_burgin Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
rachel_green That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
joshua_burgin Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
rachel_green Ah.
mrs_burgin Oh, hi, darling!
joshua_burgin Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
mrs_burgin Oh, well we cut the trip short.
mr_burgin France sucks!
joshua_burgin Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
mrs_burgin Oh, say no more!
mr_burgin We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
joshua_burgin Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
mr_burgin Yep, sucks!
rachel_green Hi you!
joshua_burgin Oh my God!
rachel_green I know, I can do more than cook.
mr_burgin I like her. She sees smart.
joshua_burgin Uhh, Rachel, my parents
rachel_green Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
mr_burgin Hi.
rachel_green Hello.
mrs_burgin Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
rachel_green What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
mrs_burgin Maybe in L.A?
rachel_green Yes!
joshua_burgin There you go.
mr_burgin So, have you kids eaten yet?
rachel_green Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
mr_burgin Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
rachel_green Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
mr_burgin So... We go eat.
rachel_green Yes.
mr_burgin You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
joey_tribbiani Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
chandler_bing No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
joey_tribbiani It's not that bad.
chandler_bing Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
joey_tribbiani So, you're just Bing?
chandler_bing I have no name.
phoebe_buffay All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
chandler_bing Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
joey_tribbiani No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
chandler_bing Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
phoebe_buffay Umm, Gene.
chandler_bing It's Clint. It's Clint!
joey_tribbiani See you later, Gene.
phoebe_buffay Bye, Gene.
chandler_bing It's Clint! Clint!
joey_tribbiani What's up with Gene?
monica_geller So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
rachel_green Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
monica_geller Oh, no!
rachel_green No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
dr_ross_geller So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
rachel_green So?
dr_ross_geller So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
monica_geller Emily's straight.
dr_ross_geller Oh, wake up!
phoebe_buffay Wow, Carol really messed you up!
dr_ross_geller Excuse me?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
dr_ross_geller Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
rachel_green Huh.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
monica_geller This totally makes sense!
dr_ross_geller It does not!
monica_geller Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
phoebe_buffay All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
rachel_green Absolutely! Absolutely!
monica_geller This is so much fun!
dr_ross_geller This is not fun!
monica_geller Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
dr_ross_geller Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
rachel_green What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
phoebe_buffay Drum roll.
chandler_bing Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
joey_tribbiani Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
chandler_bing All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
phoebe_buffay You're actually going through with this?
chandler_bing Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
phoebe_buffay You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
chandler_bing Really?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
chandler_bing Okay. Thanks.
phoebe_buffay Okay!
chandler_bing You wanna hug it out?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Yay!
chandler_bing Yay!
phoebe_buffay Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
chandler_bing Okay!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, uh
chandler_bing Bye, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Okay, bye!
chandler_bing Ha! Ha! Ha!
joey_tribbiani Ohh!
dr_ross_geller Nice luggage.
carol_willick I was gonna say
susan_bunch Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
emily_waltham Hey! I missed you.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I missed you too.
susan_bunch Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
emily_waltham Oh, so did I.
dr_ross_geller No tongue.
