joey Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don't really know what happened with that.
phoebe_sr I'm your mother.
phoebe Ehh?
joey Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler...
chandler Hi there.
joey ..and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either.
joey Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either...
joey Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
ross Hi!
rachel_and_bonnie Hi!
bonnie Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
ross Awww.
bonnie Thanks a million.
rachel Oh, you're welcome a million.
bonnie Okay, I'll see you in our room.
ross Yeah.
rachel Oh my God.
ross I know.
ross Okay, I gotta go.
rachel Whoa! What?! Why?!
ross Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
rachel Here?! Now?!
ross Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
rachel Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
ross No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
rachel Whoa-ho.
ross Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
rachel I don't know.
ross Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
rachel Oh, making it worse!
ross Okay.
phoebe_sr So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
phoebe I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
phoebe_sr Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
phoebe How close?
phoebe_sr Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
phoebe I don't even know how that would work!
phoebe_sr Well, we were...
phoebe I'm not asking!
phoebe_sr Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
phoebe Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
phoebe_sr Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
phoebe Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
phoebe_sr Wait!
phoebe I don't ever want to see you again!
phoebe Umm, where's my purse?
monica Shoot! We're out of soda.
chandler Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
monica Really?!
chandler Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
phoebe Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
chandler I found a dried up seashores.
monica Sweety, what are you talking about?
phoebe Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
joey Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
phoebe No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
phoebe Monica!
monica Oh.
ross It's over.
rachel Oh, was it awful?
ross Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
rachel I wrote you a letter.
ross Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
rachel It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
ross Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
rachel Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
ross Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
ross Oh. Oh-oh.
rachel Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
ross Done!
rachel You just finished?
ross Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
rachel So umm, does it?
ross I'm sorry.
rachel Does it?
ross Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
rachel What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
ross No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
rachel Are you sure?
ross Oh, sure! I'm sure.
rachel I know.
chandler All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
monica Ennnh.
chandler I've got canned goods.
joey Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
chandler Excellent hole, Joe.
joey Oh no! No!! My hole!!
monica Ow!! Ow!!!
joey What?! What?!! What is it?!
monica Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
chandler Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
monica It's like two miles!
joey Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
monica Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
chandler We've got to do something!
joey Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
monica What?! What is it?!
joey You're gonna have to pee on it.
monica What?!! Gross!!
joey Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
chandler Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
monica Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
joey If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
phoebe Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
ross Hey!
rachel How was the beach?
monica Nothing, I don't know.
ross What happened?
monica Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
chandler Me too!!
joey Me too.
phoebe Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
rachel Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
ross It does. It really and truly does.
ross It so does not!!!
ross She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
chandler Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
ross Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
joey No?
chandler Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
ross Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
joey Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
ross What the hell happened on that beach?!
joey It's between us and the sea, Ross!
phoebe Hi, Ursula.
ursula Hey!
phoebe Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
ursula Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
phoebe You know her?!
ursula No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
phoebe There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
ursula Hang on.
phoebe I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
ursula Yeah. So how have you been doing?
phoebe I, umm, shut up!
phoebe "Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
ursula Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
phoebe Noooo!!
ursula All right, hang on!
monica Pass the cheese, please.
monica My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
joey Nope.
chandler Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
phoebe No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
chandler I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
ross Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
chandler_monica_and_joey NO!!!
rachel All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
monica What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
ross_and_rachel Come on!
ross What happened? Joey?
joey All right.
monica No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
chandler They'll never understand!
joey Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
monica All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
chandler We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
monica I was in too much pain.
joey And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
chandler And then Joey remembered something.
joey I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
ross Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
phoebe_and_rachel Ewwww!!
monica You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
phoebe_ross_and_rachel Ewwww!!
joey That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
chandler Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
joey That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
phoebe "...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
phoebe_sr I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
phoebe Okay, bye.
phoebe_sr No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
phoebe No.
phoebe_sr Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
phoebe But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
phoebe_sr Yeah, I guess you're right.
phoebe It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
phoebe_sr Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
phoebe I-I like pizza!
phoebe_sr You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
phoebe Oh my God, so do I!
phoebe_sr I knew it, wow!!
phoebe Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
phoebe_sr Ohh, so cute.
phoebe Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
phoebe_sr I know. I'm mad at me too.
phoebe Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
phoebe_sr Hey! Me too!
phoebe All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
rachel Oh-hooo, I missed you.
ross I missed you too.
rachel Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
ross I suppose.
rachel You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
ross Umm-hmm.
rachel Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
ross WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
chandler Coffee house?
monica You bet.
ross And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
rachel Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
ross I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
rachel What?!!
ross I fell asleep!
rachel You fell asleep?!
ross It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
rachel Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
ross FINE BY ME!!
rachel Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
monica Hey!!
rachel Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
ross Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
rachel And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
chandler I KNEW IT!!!!
monica Gin.
chandler We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
monica Will you stop!
chandler Okay. All right.
monica Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
