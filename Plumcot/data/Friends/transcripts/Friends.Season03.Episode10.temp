chandler Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
rachel What?
chandler Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
gunther Rachel?
rachel Yeah.
gunther Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
rachel Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
gunther Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
rachel Eh, do you believe that?
chandler Yeah?
sarah So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
ross Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
chandler Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
ross Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
chandler I was shrieking... like a Marine.
ross All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
monica You broke a little girl's leg?!!
ross I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
chandler Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
ross Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
monica Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
rachel I'm gonna get back to retraining.
ross All right, see you guys.
chandler Look out kids, he's coming!
joey And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
phoebe Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
joey What? Me having a job?
phoebe No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
joey Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
phoebe Really?
chandler Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
gunther ..and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
rachel Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
gunther What if you put them here.
rachel Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
gunther They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
rachel Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
gunther It's all right. Sweetheart.
ross So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
sarah Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
ross Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
sarah Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
ross I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
sarah No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
ross Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
sarah The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
ross Yeah.
sarah So far, I've sold seventy-five.
ross Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
sarah Five dollars a box.
ross And what is second prize?
sarah A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
ross Well, that makes sense.
sarah Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
ross Yeah, Sarah, anything.
sarah Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
woman Yesss?
ross Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
woman You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
ross No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
woman What does that mean?
ross Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
woman I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
ross No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
woman I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
ross Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
woman I can still see you!
ross All right!!
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey. What, what are you doing here?
phoebe Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
joey Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
phoebe Destiny.
joey Sure.
phoebe Yes.
joey All right.
phoebe Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
joey Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
phoebe You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
joey Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
phoebe So, what happens to the old guys?
joey Well, they go into the chipper.
phoebe Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
joey Hey! Hey!!
ross ..and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
joey All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
ross Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
chandler Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
ross No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
ross Mon?
monica All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
ross Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
monica No.
ross Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
monica Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
ross I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
monica Oh God! I gotta go!
ross Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
gunther And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
rachel I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
joey Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
rachel Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
chandler How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
rachel Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
joey If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
rachel The fear?
chandler He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
rachel Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
chandler Because, I'm too afraid.
rachel I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
chandler Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
gunther Rachel?
rachel Yeah.
gunther Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
rachel Can't I just look at the handles on them?
gunther You would think.
rachel Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
gunther What?!
rachel Gunther, I quit.
chandler Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
ross ...and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
chandler I spelled out boobies.
monica Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
ross Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
monica What?
ross Monica, I'm cutting you off.
monica No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
ross Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
monica Oh God!
chandler So, how many have you sold so far?
ross Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
chandler Oh my God, how did you do that?
ross Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
rachel Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
ross Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
chandler Me! On my computer.
ross Well you sure used a large font.
chandler Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
rachel Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
chandler Something else I might have said?
rachel I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
ross Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
rachel No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
chandler You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
rachel You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
joey Hey! I got great news!
chandler Run, Joey! Run for your life!
joey What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
rachel No.
joey Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
rachel Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
joey Not a problem.
rachel Thanks.
joey And now for the great news.
ross What, that wasn't the great news?
joey Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
monica Christmas cookie?
joey Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
guy Looks good. I'll take it.
phoebe Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
guy It's-it's-it's almost dead!
phoebe Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
joey Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
guy I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
joey Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
monica Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
phoebe Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
monica Is this the one that I threw out last year?
phoebe All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
monica Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
phoebe Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
monica Oh.
ross Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
girl I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
ross Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
girl You're a big scrud.
ross What's a scrud?
girl Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
ross I don't have too. I can just look at you.
leader All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
ross Not nice enough.
leader Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
ross Good for a scrud.
leader Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
ross That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
leader Who's next?
ross Hi there!
leader Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
ross Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
chandler Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
ross Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
chandler Hey! How'd the interview go?
rachel Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
ross Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
phoebe This is the worst Christmas ever.
chandler Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
rachel I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
ross That word was swans.
chandler Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
phoebe Oh! Oh my God!
joey_and_monica Merry Christmas!!
phoebe You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
chandler It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
rachel Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
chandler Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
rachel I got the job!
all That's great! Hey! Excellent!
phoebe Oh, God bless us, everyone.
rachel Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
chandler Should I tell her I ordered tea?
ross No.
rachel Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
rachels_boss Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
ross I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
sarah Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
ross Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
joey Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
chandler I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
ross Oh no! An asteroid!
