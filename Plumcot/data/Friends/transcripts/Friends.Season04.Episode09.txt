chandler_bing Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
phoebe_buffay Okayyyyy, open up!
dr_ross_geller What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's for our catering business!
joey_tribbiani I think I know that girl.
monica_geller All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
rachel_green No?
phoebe_buffay No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
rachel_green Oh!
phoebe_buffay And also, we don't know what to do with this.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
monica_geller Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
phoebe_buffay Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
monica_geller Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
monica_geller Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
phoebe_buffay How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
monica_geller Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
all@ Yay!!
phoebe_buffay Oh, in that case - - Yay! That was me hopping on board.
monica_geller Oh.
chandler_bing Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
chandler_bing No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
dr_ross_geller Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
chandler_bing Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
dr_ross_geller Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
phoebe_buffay Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
dr_ross_geller Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
chandler_bing I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna call after you!
chandler_bing This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Woooo!!!
monica_geller All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
joey_tribbiani Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
dr_ross_geller Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
joey_tribbiani Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
dr_ross_geller Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
joey_tribbiani No, I had sex in high school.
rachel_green Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
joanna Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
rachel_green Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and
joanna Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
rachel_green God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
joanna Really? Well, in that case
rachel_green And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
joanna That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
rachel_green Ohh! That's great!
joanna You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
rachel_green Really?!
joanna No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
rachel_green Well, I, umm
joanna Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
chandler_bing Oh man! I am so excited - I may vomit!
joey_tribbiani Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
chandler_bing Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
joey_tribbiani Really?!
chandler_bing Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
chandler_bing It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
joey_tribbiani All right, I'll see you guys.
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Whoa-whoa-whoa!
chandler_bing Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
joey_tribbiani I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
dr_ross_geller Somewhere maybe along the equator?
joey_tribbiani Okay.
chandler_bing Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
dr_ross_geller What happened?
chandler_bing He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
chandler_bing Stupid, useless Canadian money!
mr_posner You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
rachel_green Thank you.
joanna Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
rachel_green Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
mrs_lynch I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
rachel_green Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
joanna Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
rachel_green I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
joanna Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
mr_posner Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
rachel_green Yes, I realize that
joanna And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
rachel_green I love working with designers!
joanna With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
monica_geller Hey! My first review is out!
phoebe_buffay Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
monica_geller All right, look at my on the back page.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
monica_geller Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
monica_geller Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
phoebe_buffay No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
monica_geller Haven't we made this decision?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, all right.
monica_geller Bye!
phoebe_buffay Bye!
monica_geller Who is it?
allesandro It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
monica_geller Oh my God.
allesandro I want to talk to you about your review.
monica_geller Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
allesandro Why? So you could hang up on me?
monica_geller Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
allesandro Just give me a chance too
phoebe_buffay Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
monica_geller No! Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Monica!
allesandro I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
monica_geller I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
allesandro Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
monica_geller The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
allesandro Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
monica_geller All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
allesandro Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
monica_geller Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
allesandro Lebanon.
monica_geller Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
allesandro How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
rachel_green Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
joanna I thought it went very well.
rachel_green No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
joanna Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
rachel_green There's nobody here!
joanna Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
sophie She's not making me uncomfortable.
joanna Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
rachel_green Do you want me to quit?
joanna What?! What would make you think that?
rachel_green Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
joanna Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
rachel_green What?
joanna That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking
rachel_green My drinking?
joanna Oh, I must've said that after you left.
rachel_green Said what? Exactly.
joanna That you enjoyed the occasional drink... ing binge.
rachel_green Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
joanna Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
rachel_green Say more things like that.
joanna You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
rachel_green I'd need an expense account.
joanna Done!
rachel_green And an assistant.
joanna Sophie, get in here!
joey_tribbiani Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
dr_ross_geller It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
joey_tribbiani So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
dr_ross_geller No! I balanced my checkbook.
chandler_bing Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe he didn't come!
joey_tribbiani So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
chandler_bing Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
joey_tribbiani Well, we could do that!
dr_ross_geller There's other stuff too.
joey_tribbiani We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!!
dr_ross_geller It's not like we don't know how to party!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! All right? Let's go!
chandler_bing And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Yeah!!!
chandler_bing All right!!
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
chandler_bing Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Well, those were seals, man.
rachel_green Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
monica_geller Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
rachel_green Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
monica_geller Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
rachel_green Ohh, you've waited soo long.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
rachel_green Yes!!!
monica_geller You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
rachel_green Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
phoebe_buffay Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
monica_geller Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
phoebe_buffay But we've only had one job.
monica_geller I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! What are you saying?
monica_geller I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
phoebe_buffay What?
monica_geller It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
phoebe_buffay You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
monica_geller All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
phoebe_buffay For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
monica_geller Phoebe, wait a minute!
rachel_green I'm an assistant buyer!!
joey_tribbiani All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
chandler_bing Yeah, all right.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani So, we're having fun, right?
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
dr_ross_geller I'm kinda beat.
chandler_bing Actually, me too.
joey_tribbiani Are you serious?!
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Thank God! I'm exhausted!
gunther So you guys want coffees?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, me too.
chandler_bing Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
joey_tribbiani I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
dr_ross_geller I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
dr_ross_geller How sad are we?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I know.
chandler_bing Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Yeah!
dr_ross_geller And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
joey_tribbiani We're 29, we're not women.
monica_geller Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm hearing.
monica_geller I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
phoebe_buffay What?!
monica_geller Or! A bakery delivery person.
phoebe_buffay I wa-I wa-I wa
monica_geller Pizza?!
phoebe_buffay Monica!
monica_geller All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
phoebe_buffay No.
monica_geller Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
phoebe_buffay No.
monica_geller Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
phoebe_buffay Really?! Are you sure?
monica_geller Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
phoebe_buffay Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
monica_geller Really?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
monica_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
rachel_green Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
mrs_lynch Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
rachel_green Heard what?
mrs_lynch Joanna passed away last night.
rachel_green Oh my God! How?!
mrs_lynch Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
rachel_green Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
mrs_lynch I know!
rachel_green Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
mrs_lynch I didn't realize that she was so close.
rachel_green Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
mrs_lynch No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
rachel_green Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us - nothing about an assistant buyer?
mrs_lynch No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
sophie Good morning!
rachel_green Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna
sophie I sure did!
allesandro I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
monica_geller Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
