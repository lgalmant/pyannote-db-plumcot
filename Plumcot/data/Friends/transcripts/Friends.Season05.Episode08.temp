rachel Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
ross I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
joey I need something sweet.
phoebe Does anyone wanna watch TV?
all Yeah, sure.
phoebe Monica your remote doesn't work.
monica Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
phoebe Oh. Aw, forget it.
rachel Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
joey Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
monica That's very nice.
chandler That's sweet, Joey.
joey Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
joey I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
chandler Are you aware that you're still talking?
monica Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
ross Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
phoebe Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
ross I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
chandler No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
rachel Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
ross Oh God, no.
joey Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
chandler It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
mrs_bing Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
the_housekeeper More turkey Mr. Chandler?
ross You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
phoebe I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
chandler Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
phoebe Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
past_life_phoebe More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
ross In this life, Phoebe.
phoebe Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
joey Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
phoebe Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
rachel I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
monica Oh, let's not tell this story.
all Oh, come on!
phoebe Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
rachel What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
joey Hey, it's not like it sounds.
chandler It's exactly like it sounds.
joey Hello?
phoebe Hello?
joey Phoebe?
phoebe Joey? What's going on?
joey Look.
phoebe Oh my God!
joey I know! It's stuck!!!
phoebe Easy. Step. How did it get on?
joey I put it on to scare Chandler!
phoebe Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
joey Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
phoebe Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
joey It's Joey.
monica What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
phoebe No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
monica Well, get it off now!
joey I can't! It-it's stuck!
monica Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
phoebe All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
monica Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
joey Sorry! Sorry.
monica Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
chandler Arghhhhhh!!
joey It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
chandler I'm over here big guy.
joey Yeah, you are! I scared you!
chandler You did look like an idiot.
joey Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
ross Yeah that's the same.
monica That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
phoebe Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
all Which one?
monica Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
chandler Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
monica Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
mrs_geller Monica! I think Rachel's here!
monica I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
big_nosed_rachel Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
fat_monica Oh, why? Why? What happened?
big_nosed_rachel Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over
fat_monica Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
big_nosed_rachel Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
mr_geller Hi Rachel!
big_nosed_rachel Happy Thanksgiving!
mrs_geller You too sweethart!
ross Hey!
mr_geller Oh my!
ross Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
fat_monica Ross!
ross Oh, this is Monica.
fat_monica Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
chandler Okay.
mrs_geller I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
ross Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
mrs_geller Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
fat_monica Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
chandler Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
fat_monica dammit!
ross So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
big_nosed_rachel Oh! No, not really.
ross Well, that's cool. So did
big_nosed_rachel Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
fat_monica I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
big_nosed_rachel Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
ross Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
fat_monica Call them mom and dad you loser!
ross Monica!
fat_monica Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
chandler Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
fat_monica Okay!
big_nosed_rachel Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
fat_monica Oh that's so great!
big_nosed_rachel I know!
fat_monica Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
big_nosed_rachel Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
fat_monica I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
big_nosed_rachel I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
ross So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
chandler Emotional Knapsack?
ross Yeah.
chandler Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
ross Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
chandler Dude, don't do that too me!
ross All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
chandler No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
ross Hey!
mrs_geller Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
fat_monica No. No, thank you!
mr_geller Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
chandler I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
monica Well, I do.
chandler I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
phoebe Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
ross I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
chandler I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
rachel Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
monica Yes, it was!
rachel No, it wasn't. It was actually the
monica Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
phoebe Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
chandler We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
phoebe Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
mrs_geller So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
rachel Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
mr_geller Hi Rachel.
rachel Oh hi!
mr_geller Wow, love your new nose!
mrs_geller Jack.
mr_geller What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
mrs_geller I'll get it.
rachel No, God! Please, let me!
rachel Hey!
ross Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
mr_geller God, your hair sure is different!
chandler Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
ross So uh, where's Monica?
mrs_geller She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
monica Hi, Chandler.
chandler Oh my God!
monica What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
chandler You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
ross Dude!
chandler Sorry!
mrs_geller Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
ross Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
monica So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
mr_geller Dude!
chandler Sorry.
rachel Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
monica Well it didn't!
rachel What?!
monica Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
rachel Okay, that we may be able to do.
monica How?
rachel Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
monica What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
rachel Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
monica Yeah.
rachel Yeah.
monica And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
rachel Then, you will definitely get him back!
monica Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
rachel Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
monica What do you mean?
rachel Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
monica I can do that!
rachel Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
chandler Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
monica Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
chandler Okay.
monica Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
chandler Are you all right?
monica Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
the_doctor What do we got here?
the_paramedic Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
ross Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
the_doctor It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
mr_geller Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
the_doctor Did you bring the toe?
monica Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
the_doctor Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
monica What?! What is it?
the_doctor You brought a carrot.
chandler What?
the_doctor This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
rachel You brought a carrot?!
mrs_geller Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
monica God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
the_doctor It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
chandler Without my toe?! I need my toe!
monica Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
mr_geller Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
chandler That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
monica I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
chandler That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
monica I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
chandler Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
monica Chandler!
ross Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
joey You're a dork.
chandler I can't believe this.
monica Chandler, I said I was sorry.
chandler Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
monica Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
chandler Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
chandler Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
chandler Nice try.
monica Wait, wait, wait!
chandler Look, Monica
monica Look!
chandler This is not going to work.
monica I bet this will work!
chandler You are so great! I love you!
monica What?
chandler Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
monica You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
chandler No I didn't!
monica Yes, you did!
chandler No I didn't!
monica You love me!
chandler No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
french_phoebe Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
