gunther Here you go.
rachel Thank you.
gunther Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
mark Hi!
rachel Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
mark Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
rachel Oh, okay.
mark I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
rachel Wow! Umm....
gunther I dropped a cup.
pete ...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
monica Oh, this is so great.
pete Yeah, it was.
monica All right then. Bye.
monica Hello, people who do not live here.
all Hi! Hello!
monica I gave you a key for emergencies!
phoebe We were out of Doritos.
ross Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
chandler Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
monica He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
ross Still?!
monica Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
chandler Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
monica Two.
chandler Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
joey Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
ross I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
monica_and_phoebe Oh.
chandler Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
the_director Joe. How's it going?
joey Good. Hey.
kate Hi.
joey Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
kate Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
joey Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
kate Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
joey So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
kate Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
joey Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
kate Where do I know you from?
joey Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
kate No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
joey Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
kate That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
joey See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
kate Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
joey Yeah, that was real.
phoebe Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
rachel I know.
phoebe What, so what are you gonna tell him?
rachel Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
phoebe Huh.
rachel I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
phoebe Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
rachel I don't have any issues with my Father.
phoebe Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
joey I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
ross Hello.
chandler_and_joey Hey!
ross So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
joey Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
ross Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
chandler It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
ross Then be supportive like a guy.
chandler If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
ross Hi.
rachel Hi!
ross You ah, wanted to see me?
rachel Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
ross What?!
rachel Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
ross What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
rachel No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
ross Yes.
rachel Yeah?
ross Yes, I do.
rachel Good.
ross Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
rachel Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
ross It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
rachel Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
ross No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
rachel You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
ross I'm just trying to help you, move on.
rachel Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
ross Petty...
rachel Petty...
ross Petty...
rachel Petty...
ross Petty...
rachel Small...
ross Small...
rachel You are so just doing this out of spite.
ross Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
rachel Huh?
ross I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
rachel You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
ross Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
rachel yeah-yeah-yeah!!
ross Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
phoebe So, you're like a zillionaire?
chandler And you're our age. You're our age.
phoebe Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
pete What like Pete Dakota?
phoebe Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
joey Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
chandler That's not a state Joe.
joey Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
pete I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
all Okay.
chandler You're our age!
pete So ah, we on for tomorrow?
monica Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
phoebe Yeah, kinda.
kate Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
joey Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
the_director Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
kate I have a question about this scene.
the_director Yes?
kate Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
the_director Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
joey Yeah.
kate I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
joey Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
kate It doesn't say that in the script.
joey It does in mine!
chandler I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
ross You bug me.
chandler Is there any chance you didn't see that?
chandler Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
ross I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
chandler You didn't just break up.
ross Hey, it's been like three weeks!
chandler You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
ross Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
chandler Okay.
ross She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
chandler And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
ross Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
chandler Stop what?!
ross I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
chandler No!! You can't!!
ross Look, they must be stopped!
chandler I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
ross I need juice! People need juice!!
chandler Look man!
ross People need juice!
chandler Listen to me!!
ross Juice, I need...
chandler She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
ross Yeah, okay.
chandler Okay.
ross It's just I miss her so much.
chandler I know.
mark Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
rachel Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
rachel Y'know what?
mark No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
rachel I can't do this.
mark Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
rachel Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
mark Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
rachel Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
mark That's okay.
rachel You sure?
mark Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
spokeswoman ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
pete Hey, can I ask you something?
monica Sure.
pete Where are we?
monica Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
pete Just tell me the truth.
monica Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
pete Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
monica So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
pete Oh, yeah. I know that.
monica I so wanna be attracted to you.
pete But you're not. Okay, good.
monica I'm sorry.
pete Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
monica It's not?
pete I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
monica Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
pete Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
spokeswoman And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
pete One second.
chandler I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
chandler I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
joey Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
chandler Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
joey God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
chandler I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
joey Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
chandler I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
joey Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
chandler Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
joey Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
kate Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
joey Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
the_director You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
kate Well, that was ah...
joey Better?
kate Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
joey Ah, Kate?
kate Yeah?
joey You ah, you forgot your shoes.
kate I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
joey Hey, listen you ah....
kate Hmm?
joey ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
kate Umm.
the_director Kate?
kate Yep.
the_director You ready to go?
kate Yeah.
the_director Very nice. Very nice.
kate So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
joey Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
phoebe Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
chandler 'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
phoebe It isn't?
chandler No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
phoebe Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
rachel Hey!
monica Hey, Rach, how was work?
rachel Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
monica By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
rachel Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
monica Something wrong?
rachel No. Nothing.
chandler So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
phoebe Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
chandler What about things that are already gold?
phoebe Ahh, his work is done.
chandler Okay, let's play my game now.
phoebe Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
