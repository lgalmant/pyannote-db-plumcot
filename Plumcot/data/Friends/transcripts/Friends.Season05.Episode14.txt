phoebe_buffay Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
rachel_green I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
dr_ross_geller Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
rachel_green Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
chandler_bing And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
all@ Good idea! Yes!
dr_ross_geller It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
joey_tribbiani Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
chandler_bing Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
rachel_green Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
phoebe_buffay It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
dr_ross_geller Ohh.
rachel_green Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
rachel_green Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
rachel_green OH MY GOD!!!
phoebe_buffay OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
rachel_green Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
phoebe_buffay NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
rachel_green I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
phoebe_buffay YOU KNOW?!!!
rachel_green Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Ohhh!!!
rachel_green HI!! Hi!
dr_ross_geller What?! What?!
rachel_green Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
dr_ross_geller Actually, it looks really good.
phoebe_buffay Get in here!!!
phoebe_buffay You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
rachel_green Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys!
rachel_green Joey! Come here! Come here!
joey_tribbiani What? What?
rachel_green Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
joey_tribbiani You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
rachel_green No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
phoebe_buffay Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
joey_tribbiani Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
phoebe_buffay Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
rachel_green Wh-what do you mean?
phoebe_buffay Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
rachel_green Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
joey_tribbiani No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
rachel_green Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
joey_tribbiani I can't take any
phoebe_buffay No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
joey_tribbiani Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
rachel_green You don't have any secrets!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
rachel_green So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
joey_tribbiani Ugh.
phoebe_buffay Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
chandler_bing Hello children!
all@ Hey!
phoebe_buffay Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
chandler_bing Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
chandler_bing Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
chandler_bing Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
phoebe_buffay Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
chandler_bing Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
phoebe_buffay Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
chandler_bing What's going on?
phoebe_buffay I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
monica_geller You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
chandler_bing Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
monica_geller Okay, now you're even cuter!!
chandler_bing Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
monica_geller What are you talking about?
chandler_bing I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
monica_geller That's not possible!
chandler_bing Ow!
monica_geller I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
chandler_bing Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
monica_geller I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
chandler_bing No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
monica_geller This bicep?
chandler_bing Well it's not flexed right now!
rachel_green Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
monica_geller Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
rachel_green Oh.
monica_geller Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
chandler_bing Sure, I'll do it with ya.
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
monica_geller I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
phoebe_buffay I have quarters!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
dr_ross_geller Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
monica_geller Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing That new mountain bike?
dr_ross_geller No.
monica_geller Well what did you send?
dr_ross_geller A basket of mini-muffins.
phoebe_buffay But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
dr_ross_geller The small one.
rachel_green What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
dr_ross_geller Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
chandler_bing Your work makes me sad.
dr_ross_geller Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
rachel_green All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
monica_geller Bye!
all@ Bye!
phoebe_buffay Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
chandler_bing Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
monica_geller Actually, I did!
chandler_bing Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
monica_geller Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
chandler_bing Are you serious?
monica_geller Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
chandler_bing Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
chandler_bing Joey!
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
chandler_bing Phoebe knows about us!
joey_tribbiani Well I didn't tell them!
monica_geller Them?! Who's them?
joey_tribbiani Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
monica_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
chandler_bing Oh man!
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
monica_geller Unless
joey_tribbiani No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
monica_geller Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
chandler_bing Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
dr_ross_geller Noooo.
rachel_green Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
dr_ross_geller Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
rachel_green Y'know what you should do?
dr_ross_geller Huh?
rachel_green You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
joey_tribbiani I'm listening.
rachel_green See?
dr_ross_geller That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
phoebe_buffay He broke that.
dr_ross_geller Well, he had gravity boots.
rachel_green Yeah, he broke those too.
joey_tribbiani So he likes to break stuff.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
phoebe_buffay I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
dr_ross_geller Right.
rachel_green Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Oh? Hello you.
chandler_bing Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
phoebe_buffay Eh?
chandler_bing Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
phoebe_buffay Really?
chandler_bing Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
phoebe_buffay I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
rachel_green Are you kidding?!
phoebe_buffay No!
rachel_green I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
joey_tribbiani No.
rachel_green Joey!
joey_tribbiani They know you know.
rachel_green Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
phoebe_buffay God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
joey_tribbiani I couldn't even if I wanted too.
dr_ross_geller Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
monica_geller Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
chandler_bing Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
monica_geller Oh yeah!
phoebe_buffay All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.

phoebe_buffay Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
chandler_bing You look good.
phoebe_buffay Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
chandler_bing Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
phoebe_buffay Really?
chandler_bing Oh, do you not want to?
phoebe_buffay No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
chandler_bing Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
chandler_bing Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
monica_geller She's bluffing!
chandler_bing Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
phoebe_buffay He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
joey_tribbiani Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
rachel_green Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
joey_tribbiani Ooh!
rachel_green Okay!
joey_tribbiani I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
