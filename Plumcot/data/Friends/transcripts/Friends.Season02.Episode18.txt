dr_ross_geller I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
monica_geller We, we just wanna see the end.
rachel_green So what happens next?
joey_tribbiani Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
chandler_bing God that is good TV.
chandler_bing Phoebs, play with meeee.
phoebe_buffay No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
chandler_bing Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
phoebe_buffay Why don't you play with your roommate?
chandler_bing Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
phoebe_buffay Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
chandler_bing No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
phoebe_buffay Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
chandler_bing We don't need to remedy that.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
eddie_menuek What was that?
phoebe_buffay Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
eddie_menuek Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
phoebe_buffay Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
chandler_bing That was so lame.
phoebe_buffay I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
chandler_bing So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
eddie_menuek That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
chandler_bing What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
eddie_menuek That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
chandler_bing Well it's not Sean Penn.
eddie_menuek Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
dr_richard_burke Phoebe's got another job, right?
rachel_green Great set tonight Phoebs.
phoebe_buffay I know.
dr_ross_geller Well, we should probably get going.
dr_richard_burke Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
monica_geller Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
dr_richard_burke I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
monica_geller Well, maybe you don't need them.
dr_ross_geller My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
monica_geller Shut up, I'm happy.
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
dr_richard_burke Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
phoebe_buffay Ok.
dr_richard_burke Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
monica_geller Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
rachel_green Phoebe's dead.

chandler_bing Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
tilly He's kind of intense huh?
chandler_bing Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
eddie_menuek A little what?
chandler_bing Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.

chandler_bing Bye.
chandler_bing So, we gettin' a fish?
eddie_menuek You had sex with her didn't you?
joey_tribbiani Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
phoebe_buffay Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
joey_tribbiani Page 42, page 42, page 42.
phoebe_buffay Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, I look good.
phoebe_buffay Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
joey_tribbiani Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
phoebe_buffay Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
joey_tribbiani Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
writer Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
joey_tribbiani I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
delivery_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode18 Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
joey_tribbiani They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
_delivery_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode18 Right. Could you sign this?
joey_tribbiani No. No way, I'm not signing that.
delivery_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode18 I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
joey_tribbiani How can they do this to me?
delivery_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode18 Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
monica_geller Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
rachel_green Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
dr_ross_geller G'night.
dr_richard_burke Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
monica_geller Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
dr_richard_burke Two.
monica_geller Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
dr_richard_burke Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
monica_geller Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
dr_richard_burke Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
monica_geller Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
rachel_green Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
dr_ross_geller Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
rachel_green Uhhhooo.
dr_ross_geller C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
rachel_green Well, there's you.
dr_ross_geller Better not be doin' these in order.
rachel_green Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
dr_ross_geller Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
rachel_green Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
dr_ross_geller Really?
rachel_green Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
chandler_bing Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
eddie_menuek That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
chandler_bing This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
eddie_menuek Where's Buddy?
chandler_bing Buddy?
eddie_menuek My fish, Buddy.
chandler_bing There was no fish when she dropped it off.
eddie_menuek Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
chandler_bing Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
dr_richard_burke That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
monica_geller Well yeah.
dr_richard_burke Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
monica_geller You really ok with it?
dr_richard_burke Oh honey, I'm fine.
monica_geller Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
dr_richard_burke What? Alright, what about my two?
monica_geller Well, it just seems like a really small number.
dr_richard_burke Right, and...
monica_geller And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
dr_richard_burke Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
monica_geller But you've only slept with two people.
dr_richard_burke Right.
monica_geller Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
dr_richard_burke Now I do.
rachel_green Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
rachel_green God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
dr_ross_geller Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
rachel_green Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
dr_ross_geller Knock-knock.
rachel_green But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
dr_ross_geller Until now.
rachel_green Oh, hi.
monica_geller Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
rachel_green Oh my God, honey that's great.
monica_geller I know. I just can't find...
rachel_green Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
monica_geller You need one too?
rachel_green Ooooh yeah.
monica_geller There's only one.
dr_richard_burke Monica.
monica_geller Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
dr_ross_geller Rachel. Hey.
dr_richard_burke Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
dr_ross_geller Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
dr_richard_burke No.
dr_ross_geller Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
dr_richard_burke I have a little comb.
dr_ross_geller Oh. And what do you call that?
dr_richard_burke A moustache comb.
rachel_green Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
monica_geller No.
rachel_green Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
monica_geller Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
rachel_green Agghhh.
dr_ross_geller So were you in Nam?
rachel_green Rock-paper-scissors?
monica_geller Yeah.
monica_geller@rachel_green One two three.
rachel_green Yeesss.
monica_geller Fine, go have sex.
dr_richard_burke No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
dr_ross_geller No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
rachel_green Honey.
dr_ross_geller What, what oh....
dr_richard_burke Shall we?
monica_geller It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
dr_richard_burke Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
chandler_bing So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
monica_geller Why?
chandler_bing Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
phoebe_buffay Why would you kill his fish?
chandler_bing Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
rachel_green Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Wait, he's not here yet.
rachel_green So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Alright.
chandler_bing Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
rachel_green Oh good.
monica_geller Did they just kill off Joey?
dr_ross_geller No. Now maybe.
dr_ross_geller C'mon.
rachel_green Joey.
dr_ross_geller Open up. We want to talk to you.
joey_tribbiani I don't feel like talkin.
rachel_green Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
chandler_bing We're worried about you.
monica_geller And some of us really have to pee.
monica_geller Sorry Joey
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
chandler_bing We came over as soon as we saw.
dr_ross_geller How could you not tell us?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
rachel_green Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
joey_tribbiani Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
phoebe_buffay But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
joey_tribbiani Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
phoebe_buffay Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
monica_geller Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
chandler_bing It's gonna be ok. You know that?
joey_tribbiani No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
chandler_bing I'm sorry man.
rachel_green Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
joey_tribbiani No, that means nothin to me.
chandler_bing Uhhhaahh.
eddie_menuek Pecan sandy, just made em.
chandler_bing Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
eddie_menuek Uh, sure, why not.
chandler_bing Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
eddie_menuek I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
chandler_bing Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
eddie_menuek What's you point man?
chandler_bing Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
dr_richard_burke Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
dr_richard_burke Ohh, brisk tonight.
dr_ross_geller Oh man.
dr_richard_burke Let's never speak of this.
dr_ross_geller You got it.
