phoebe_buffay What am I sitting on?
chandler_bing Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
phoebe_buffay Ew-eww!! Undies!
rachel_green All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
dr_ross_geller Well, they're not mine!
chandler_bing Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, they're mine.
chandler_bing See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
dr_ross_geller Why are they here?
joey_tribbiani I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
rachel_green Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
chandler_bing Yeah!
monica_geller Yeah!
rachel_green Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
joey_tribbiani Chandler? A word.
joey_tribbiani That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
monica_geller Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
joey_tribbiani Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
monica_geller Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't
chandler_bing All this lying has been hard on us too.
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
chandler_bing Well, yeah actually.
monica_geller We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
chandler_bing I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
monica_geller We are! Help us!
chandler_bing Help!
joey_tribbiani All right! But, you do it with me once.
monica_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani Didn't think so.
monica_geller Hey, Phoebe!
chandler_bing Hi, Pheebs!
rachel_green Hey, Pheebs!
joey_tribbiani Hey, Pheebs!
rachel_green What are you reading?
phoebe_buffay Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
chandler_bing I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
rachel_green Honey that sounds like fun.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
rachel_green Oh, I read that in high school.
phoebe_buffay This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
joey_tribbiani What's wrong buddy?
dr_ross_geller Someone at work ate my sandwich!
chandler_bing Well, what did the police say?
dr_ross_geller My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
chandler_bing Ross, it's just a sandwich!
dr_ross_geller Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
monica_geller Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
dr_ross_geller That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
chandler_bing Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
joey_tribbiani I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
phoebe_buffay Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
dr_ross_geller Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
chandler_bing Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
phoebe_buffay Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
all@ Whoa! Ohh!!
monica_geller Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
phoebe_buffay Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
monica_geller Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Well, he stabbed me first!!
rachel_green Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
rachel_green So Pheebs, what is the book about?
phoebe_buffay I thought you said you read it in high school.
rachel_green Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
phoebe_buffay Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
rachel_green Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
rachel_green Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
phoebe_buffay You completely stole my answer!
rachel_green Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
phoebe_buffay Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
phoebe_buffay I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Would ya care to venture one?
phoebe_buffay Would you care to venture one?
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
phoebe_buffay Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 All right, let's move on.
phoebe_buffay Okay then.
phoebe_buffay Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
rachel_green Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
monica_geller Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
dr_ross_geller That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
cynthia God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
joey_tribbiani So you uh, still wondering?
cynthia No, we just went out.
joey_tribbiani You're smart. I like that.
cynthia Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
cynthia I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
joey_tribbiani Hiya.
rachel_green Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna
chandler_bing What is going on here?
rachel_green And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
joey_tribbiani I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
joey_tribbiani You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
monica_geller We're so sorry.
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
chandler_bing No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
chandler_bing Oh-I don't know.
joey_tribbiani Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
monica_geller Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
joey_tribbiani All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
dr_ledbetter Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, of course, Donald.
dr_ledbetter We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
dr_ross_geller What?!
dr_ledbetter Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
dr_ledbetter We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
dr_ross_geller Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
dr_ledbetter A sandwich?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
dr_ledbetter Oh, you know what?
dr_ross_geller What?
dr_ledbetter I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
dr_ross_geller You ate my sandwich?
dr_ledbetter It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
dr_ledbetter No.
dr_ross_geller Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
dr_ledbetter There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
dr_ross_geller That said it was my sandwich?!
dr_ledbetter Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
dr_ross_geller What?
dr_ledbetter Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
dr_ross_geller You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
dr_ross_geller MY SANDWICH?!!!
dr_ross_geller MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
rachel_green So umm, what's this book about?
phoebe_buffay You didn't read this one either?!
rachel_green Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
phoebe_buffay What?
rachel_green Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
phoebe_buffay No! You should've read it yourself!
rachel_green Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
phoebe_buffay Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
rachel_green A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
phoebe_buffay Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Well, go ahead Rachel.
rachel_green Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
rachel_green Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
chandler_bing You're naked in this picture!
monica_geller I know.
chandler_bing Ross?
dr_ross_geller Hey Chandler. Monica!
monica_geller Ross, are you okay?
dr_ross_geller I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
monica_geller Why?!
dr_ross_geller On account of my rage.
chandler_bing Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
dr_ross_geller He gave me a pill for it.
monica_geller A pill?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
monica_geller Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
chandler_bing And you're okay with that?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
rachel_green Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
rachel_green That was not funny!
phoebe_buffay Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
rachel_green Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
phoebe_buffay Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
rachel_green Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
monica_geller I know! I know! I know!
the_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode09 Monica, you asked the question.
rachel_green Oh my God! That's Monica!!
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
rachel_green You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
rachel_green Joey has got a secret peephole!
chandler_bing Oh no! No! No! No!
rachel_green Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
rachel_green Look!
dr_ross_geller Dude! That's my sister!
monica_geller Give me that!
phoebe_buffay All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
joey_tribbiani No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda
chandler_bing All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
joey_tribbiani Thank you!
chandler_bing Joey's a sex addict.
joey_tribbiani What?!! No I'm not!!
monica_geller It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
joey_tribbiani No! No! I am not a sex addict!
monica_geller Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
joey_tribbiani No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
rachel_green Well, what is the truth?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, what's going on?
phoebe_buffay What's going on?
joey_tribbiani I slept with Monica.
chandler_bing Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
monica_geller Oh no!
dr_ross_geller You slept with my sister?
joey_tribbiani Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
dr_ross_geller This is not good for my rage.
rachel_green Monica, is this true?
joey_tribbiani Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
monica_geller Yes it's true.
rachel_green Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
joey_tribbiani Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
monica_geller I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
dr_ross_geller My God Monica!!
chandler_bing Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
joey_tribbiani No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
phoebe_buffay So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
joey_tribbiani That makes sense!
rachel_green And the video camera?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, Monica?
monica_geller I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
joey_tribbiani But sadly I could not be enticed.
dr_ross_geller Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
monica_geller I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
joey_tribbiani Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
phoebe_buffay I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
the_female_student Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
phoebe_buffay I don't know! I didn't come with her!
monica_geller All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
all@ A test?!!
monica_geller Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
