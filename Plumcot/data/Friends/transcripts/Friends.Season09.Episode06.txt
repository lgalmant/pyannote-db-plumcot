chandler_bing Hello? Hello?
monica_geller I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
chandler_bing Honey, you're screaming.
monica_geller YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
chandler_bing Oh, that's great.
monica_geller Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
chandler_bing Awesome.
monica_geller Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
mike_hannigan This is nice.
phoebe_buffay I know!
mike_hannigan You need both hands for that?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?
joey_tribbiani Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
mike_hannigan Is it?
phoebe_buffay Maybe not, is it?
mike_hannigan Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
phoebe_buffay I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
mike_hannigan Oh, sorry.
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
mike_hannigan It's to my apartment.
phoebe_buffay Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
mike_hannigan Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
phoebe_buffay Oh no, I want to.
mike_hannigan Oh, thank God.
phoebe_buffay Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
mike_hannigan Is this cool, huh?
phoebe_buffay It really is.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
rachel_green So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
prospective_nanny I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better.
rachel_green That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
prospective_nanny Not really.
rachel_green Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
rachel_green Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
prospective_nanny Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing?
dr_ross_geller Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
prospective_nanny That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
rachel_green Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
rachel_green What, the blonde with no bra?
dr_ross_geller She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
rachel_green Okay...
sandy Hi... I'm Sandy.
dr_ross_geller And she's a little mannish...
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! David!
david Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
phoebe_buffay No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
david Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
phoebe_buffay Who cares, it got you here.
david Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
phoebe_buffay Wow. Where is your luggage?
david Damn it!
phoebe_buffay A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
david Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
phoebe_buffay Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
david Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone?
phoebe_buffay No...
phoebe_buffay I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
monica_geller Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
phoebe_buffay He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
monica_geller Oh, well... That had been your window.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
monica_geller Really? The scientist guy?
phoebe_buffay Really? Chandler?
monica_geller Continue...
phoebe_buffay Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
monica_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
monica_geller Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
phoebe_buffay Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
monica_geller What are you gonna do?
phoebe_buffay I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
monica_geller You have to tell David!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
chandler_bing Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
monica_geller Heeeeeey!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
monica_geller Was your cabin pressurised?
chandler_bing And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
chandler_bing What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
monica_geller No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
chandler_bing Yeah, he came up...
monica_geller Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
chandler_bing Were you there?
phoebe_buffay No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
sandy I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...
rachel_green Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
dr_ross_geller Are you gay?
rachel_green Ross!
sandy It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
rachel_green Oh!
sandy Her name is Deliah.
rachel_green Oh, that's pretty.
dr_ross_geller So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
sandy I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
sandy Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
rachel_green Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
sandy Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
rachel_green Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
rachel_green So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
dr_ross_geller Because, it's weird!
rachel_green Why?
dr_ross_geller What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
rachel_green Yes?
dr_ross_geller King?
sandy I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...
rachel_green Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
sandy That's great! I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
rachel_green Oooh... '''I really can't hear what she says''' come here.
dr_ross_geller You gotta be at least bi...
chandler_bing Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
joey_tribbiani Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
chandler_bing Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
joey_tribbiani I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
chandler_bing Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
joey_tribbiani Seriously? She actually said that?
chandler_bing Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
joey_tribbiani Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
chandler_bing Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Without that, you just got "lame with women".
chandler_bing Ye....
monica_geller Hi! There you are.
joey_tribbiani Fire trucks!
david Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
phoebe_buffay Oof...
david In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.
phoebe_buffay Oh, wait, wait!
david Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
phoebe_buffay No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His.. his name is Mike.
david Oh... oh...
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I should have told you.
david No... well, yeah.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
david Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?
phoebe_buffay I am happy.
david Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...
phoebe_buffay Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
david Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
phoebe_buffay Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
david No... no...
phoebe_buffay I mean...
david In Minsk...
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
david ..it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.
phoebe_buffay Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
rachel_green Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
dr_ross_geller Is everything allright?
rachel_green Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
sandy Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
rachel_green I can't... I can't hear it again.
sandy You know, I can't tell it again...
dr_ross_geller And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
rachel_green Yeah! Excuse me...
dr_ross_geller Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
rachel_green Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
rachel_green What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing!
rachel_green Sandy made Madeleines.
dr_ross_geller This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
rachel_green Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
dr_ross_geller Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
rachel_green Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
phoebe_buffay Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
david But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
phoebe_buffay No, no. No.
david But... ergo...
phoebe_buffay Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
david Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui...
mike_hannigan Well... hey, the key works...!
phoebe_buffay And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
monica_geller Yeah! I think that's great!
dr_ross_geller Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
monica_geller Oh... How are they?
dr_ross_geller Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
joey_tribbiani Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
joey_tribbiani That's like a woman wanting to be a...
dr_ross_geller ..a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
monica_geller Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
joey_tribbiani Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
monica_geller Yeah, so?
dr_ross_geller Wow!
joey_tribbiani Really? Do you not know Chandler?
monica_geller Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
joey_tribbiani So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
dr_ross_geller Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
joey_tribbiani ..No...
monica_geller I can't believe he's that upset about this...
joey_tribbiani Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Heeeyy! Hey!
chandler_bing What are you guys talking about?
dr_ross_geller Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
chandler_bing You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
chandler_bing You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
monica_geller Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
chandler_bing If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
monica_geller Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
chandler_bing What is so funny about that?
monica_geller Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
chandler_bing Did you tell her what we talked about?
joey_tribbiani Yeah....
chandler_bing So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
monica_geller Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
chandler_bing Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
monica_geller Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
chandler_bing I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
monica_geller Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
dr_ross_geller Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
joey_tribbiani Not knowing when to shut up...
dr_ross_geller Yep! That's my thing...
mike_hannigan So... how many guys have your key?
phoebe_buffay No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
mike_hannigan Your lipstick's on his mouth.
david Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
phoebe_buffay No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
mike_hannigan Did you uhm...
phoebe_buffay No, no...
mike_hannigan ..kiss him?
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, yeah...
david Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.
mike_hannigan Don't point your finger at me.
david Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
mike_hannigan Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...
phoebe_buffay Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.
david Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... well, you just better watch out.
mike_hannigan Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
david Oh, you're going to Minsk?
mike_hannigan Well, I might.
david Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well... guys?
david Right... Goodbye Phoebe.
mike_hannigan Hey, what are you kidding me?
david Right-o, right-o... Take good care of her.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
mike_hannigan It's never gonna happen again right?
phoebe_buffay Right! Never! Never! I swear!
david I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
dr_ross_geller Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
joey_tribbiani Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
dr_ross_geller I swear to God...!
sandy Who's up for puppets?
joey_tribbiani Me! I'm up for puppets!
sandy Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
sandy Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.
joey_tribbiani I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
sandy Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus...
rachel_green That was kind of rude!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
rachel_green You know, he was just doing his job...
dr_ross_geller Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
rachel_green Oh, come on Ross...
dr_ross_geller No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
rachel_green Oh... That's true.
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
rachel_green Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
sandy So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
joey_tribbiani I am learning so much from you.
chandler_bing Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
monica_geller Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
chandler_bing Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
monica_geller Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
chandler_bing I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
joey_tribbiani Allright. See you later!
chandler_bing See ya!
joey_tribbiani Did that guy really make that joke?
monica_geller Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
dr_ross_geller Here goes...
rachel_green I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
dr_ross_geller Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
sandy Oh...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
rachel_green YOU! You feel!
dr_ross_geller I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
sandy Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
rachel_green Oh, damn you Geller!
dr_ross_geller Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
sandy No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
dr_ross_geller No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
sandy What is it...? Please...?
dr_ross_geller You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
sandy That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
dr_ross_geller Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
sandy hmmm...
dr_ross_geller I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
rachel_green Huh ha ha!
dr_ross_geller I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
sandy That must have been hard.
dr_ross_geller It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
sandy But you are a real boy!
dr_ross_geller I know I am!.And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
sandy It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
dr_ross_geller Here come some more...
sandy And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?
joey_tribbiani What kind?
sandy A friend-ship...
joey_tribbiani Wow! You blow my mind...
sandy Oh, I gotta go.
joey_tribbiani Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
sandy Twenty bucks.
joey_tribbiani It's like the cheapest college ever.
