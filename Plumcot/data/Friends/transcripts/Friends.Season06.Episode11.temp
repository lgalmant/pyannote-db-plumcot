joey Hey!
ross Hey!
joey Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
monica Honey, we have been through this before!
rachel Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
phoebe She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
joey Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
monica You serious?!
chandler That's great!
monica Really?!
phoebe Yeah well, we'll see.
ross You kissed her.
joey Oh we kissed it up real nice.
chandler So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
joey I came over here to tell you guys.
chandler So she's just waiting over there for ya?
janine I gotta go.
joey Okay.
janine I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
joey Okay.
janine Okay, now I'm really late.
joey Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
janine Bye.
monica Bye.
joey Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
monica I am so glad you said cooks.
rachel I know.
chandler Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
rachel Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
chandler I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
rachel Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
monica You got it from Pottery Barn?!
rachel Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
chandler A pharmacist.
monica Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
joey I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
chandler You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
joey I was tired!
rachel Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
monica Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
rachel Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
monica It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
joey Hey! I made that for her!
chandler You made pottery?
joey Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
monica I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
rachel Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
chandler Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
chandler ...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
monica I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
chandler Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
janine I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
monica Yeah.
joey And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
monica So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
janine Oh that would be great!
joey Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
monica Joey, you don't have too!
joey Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
chandler Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
joey See ya tomorrow!
monica Tomorrow!
janine Can't wait!
janine How are we gonna get out of that one?
joey What?
janine I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
joey What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
janine I don't know, they're just a little blah!
joey Blah?!
janine Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
joey Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
janine No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
joey I guess.
janine Thank you.
joey If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey!
phoebe Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
rachel Guess!
phoebe Umm, a flea market?
rachel Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
phoebe Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
rachel Ohh, yes.
phoebe Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
rachel Almost.
phoebe How much was it?
rachel It was only 500 bucks.
phoebe 500 bucks at a flea market?!
rachel Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
phoebe Oh no.
rachel Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
phoebe A dollar?
rachel And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
phoebe Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Well, what period is it from?
rachel Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
phoebe Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or
rachel Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
phoebe White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
rachel Hey! We're here!
ross Hey!
rachel Ohh! Oh my God!
ross You like it?
rachel Oh no!
ross It's my new apothecary table!
rachel Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
ross Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
rachel I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
ross Why did you do that?
rachel Because she hates Pottery Barn.
ross She hates Pottery Barn?!!
rachel I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
ross What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
rachel Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
ross Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
rachel Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
ross Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
rachel Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
ross Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey!
ross Hey!
rachel Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
phoebe Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
ross Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
phoebe Sure!
rachel He got it a flea market!
phoebe You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
monica Hey!
joey Hi!
monica The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
chandler And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
joey Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
monica What happened to Janine?
joey Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
chandler Oh that's too bad.
joey Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
janine Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
joey 'Kay!
janine Bye.
chandler That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
joey No-no, she really is sick!
chandler Then why-why is she going to a play?!
joey Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
monica Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
joey Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
chandler Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
joey Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
monica What?!! What?
chandler So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
monica Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
chandler And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
joey I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
chandler No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
joey I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
chandler Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
joey Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
monica Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
chandler Okay.
monica I do not like that woman!
joey I can hear you!
monica I am loud!
all Aww!
rachel That's funny.
ross Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
phoebe Oh sure! Noo!
rachel Ohh!!
ross My apothecary table!!!
phoebe What?!
rachel Noooooo!!
phoebe Ross, where did you get this?!
ross I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
rachel Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
phoebe Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
rachel Oh yes.
phoebe Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
ross Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
phoebe Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
chandler Okay, one more time.
monica Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
chandler Perfect decibel.
monica I know!!!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey.
joey So uh, what are you guys doing?
chandler Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
joey Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
monica Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
joey Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
monica We owe you?!
joey That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
monica We didn't give you any money!
joey You don't think I know that!
rachel ...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
ross Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
rachel I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
ross A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey.
phoebe Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
ross Fascinating.
phoebe Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
rachel Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
phoebe Ah!
ross Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
rachel Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
phoebe Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
rachel Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
phoebe Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
ross Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
rachel Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
phoebe No! I do want to!
rachel Oh, she does want to.
ross She does want to.
phoebe Yeah!
rachel Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
phoebe Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
rachel Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
phoebe No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
rachel Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
phoebe That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
rachel No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
phoebe Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
rachel Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
phoebe No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
rachel Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
phoebe I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
rachel What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
phoebe But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
rachel Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
phoebe Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
rachel That's right!
phoebe But at least the apothecary table is real.
joey Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
janine Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
chandler That's totally understandable.
monica Don't worry about it.
janine So we can go out again?
chandler Oh yeah!
monica Absolutely!
janine Oh good.
joey Oh well then, good night!
monica Good night!
joey See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
janine We have got to move!
monica I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
chandler And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
janine Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
monica All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
joey All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
chandler Y'know I think you can take her.
monica You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
joey All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
janine They said stuff to me too, y'know!
joey I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
janine Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
joey Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
monica What did I tell you about the hall?!
janine I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
monica Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
janine Great.
monica Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
janine Me too.
monica Okay.
janine I'll see you.
monica Bye.
janine Or I'll hear you.
monica That's it big girl! Come on!
janine Wait!
monica You'd better run!
chandler Did you hear that?
joey Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
chandler Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
joey Yeah!
ross Hey!
joey How ya doin'?
chandler Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
joey Pretty much, yeah.
monica I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
joey Well, when it's not right, you know it.
chandler You okay?
joey Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
ross Y'know what would cheer you up?
joey What?
ross I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
joey You're right! That did cheer me up!
