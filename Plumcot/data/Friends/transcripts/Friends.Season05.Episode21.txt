gary Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
phoebe_buffay I'm fine, thanks.
chandler_bing Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
monica_geller No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
chandler_bing Okay.
chandler_bing Hiya doin' pumpkin?
phoebe_buffay Nope.
monica_geller So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
gary I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
monica_geller Oh my God!
gary What do you, what do you think?
monica_geller I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
gary Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
monica_geller I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
gary I'll see you after work sweetie.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Bye!
phoebe_buffay So, what movie should we see?
monica_geller Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
phoebe_buffay What?! Really?!
monica_geller He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
phoebe_buffay I can't believe this!
chandler_bing Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
monica_geller Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
chandler_bing Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
phoebe_buffay No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
monica_geller Ohhhh!
phoebe_buffay No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
chandler_bing So, what are you gonna do?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. I'll just handle it - I'll ask you to talk to him!
chandler_bing Me?! Why me?
phoebe_buffay Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a... man!
chandler_bing I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
monica_geller That is so sweet!
chandler_bing Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
joey_tribbiani Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
dr_ross_geller Also an island.
joey_tribbiani Hey, what time is it?
dr_ross_geller 2
joey_tribbiani Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
dr_ross_geller Are you serious?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
dr_ross_geller Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
joey_tribbiani Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
rachel_green Hey, you guys
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Is Monica here?
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani No.
rachel_green All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
dr_ross_geller You bought Shawn Cassidy!
rachel_green Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Yeah!
rachel_green Okay! Check it out!
dr_ross_geller What-what is it?!
joey_tribbiani What the hell is that?!!
rachel_green It's a, it's a cat!
joey_tribbiani That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
rachel_green Yes it is!
dr_ross_geller Why is it inside out?!
rachel_green Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
dr_ross_geller How much did you pay for that?
rachel_green Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? How much?
rachel_green A thousand bucks.
dr_ross_geller ON A CAT??!!!!
joey_tribbiani It's not a cat!
rachel_green All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
dr_ross_geller Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
joey_tribbiani It's not a cat!
rachel_green Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
dr_ross_geller Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, the ball thing.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
dr_ross_geller Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
joey_tribbiani Okay!
joey_tribbiani Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
joey_tribbiani Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
dr_ross_geller I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
chandler_bing Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
gary Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
chandler_bing Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
gary Yeah?
chandler_bing It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
gary What's up?
chandler_bing Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
gary Sure. Okay.
chandler_bing Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
gary Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
chandler_bing You mean scared.
gary No, I mean happy.
chandler_bing Scared? Happy?
gary Chandler, what-what are you doing?
chandler_bing I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
gary I know! I can't wait!
chandler_bing Were you're parents happy, or something?
gary Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just - I wanna be around her as much as I can.
chandler_bing Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
gary So you know what I'm talking about, right?
chandler_bing Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
gary No, it's too soon for you guys.
chandler_bing Yeah, you're right about that.
dr_ross_geller now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
joey_tribbiani Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
monica_geller Hey guys!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
monica_geller Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
monica_geller All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
dr_ross_geller How do you know? You don't have a watch.
monica_geller Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
joey_tribbiani Oh, I don't know... . Yeah, can't do it.
monica_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we haven't dropped it in
dr_ross_geller 2 hours, 27 minutes.
monica_geller Really?!
monica_geller I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach!
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
rachel_green Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
monica_geller Rach?
rachel_green Yeah?
monica_geller You have scratches all over you, what happened?
rachel_green Well, it's my cat.
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green Oh yeah, I got a cat.
monica_geller I don't want a cat!
joey_tribbiani Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
dr_ross_geller Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
monica_geller What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
rachel_green Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
chandler_bing Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
chandler_bing Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
phoebe_buffay What?!
chandler_bing He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
phoebe_buffay You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
chandler_bing I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
phoebe_buffay Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
gary Hey Chandler.
chandler_bing Hey Gar!
gary Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Okay.
gary You look very pretty today.
phoebe_buffay Thanks! Okay.
gary Here's the thing.
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
gary Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm.
gary Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
phoebe_buffay No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
gary Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
gary I want you to move in with me.
phoebe_buffay That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
gary Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
phoebe_buffay I just - I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
gary Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just - I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
gary Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Which is why my answer is yes!
gary Really?!
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh! I'm so... happy.
dr_ross_geller Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
chandler_bing Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
joey_tribbiani That's right baby.
chandler_bing All right, let me in.
monica_geller No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller He's a dropper!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, that's right!
chandler_bing I'm not a dropper!
dr_ross_geller It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
chandler_bing It's throwing and catching!
dr_ross_geller All right.
chandler_bing Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
monica_geller Oh my - Oh good God!
rachel_green I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
dr_ross_geller Baking it didn't help, huh?
monica_geller So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
rachel_green I tried! They won't take her back.
chandler_bing Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
monica_geller Rach, why won't they take it back?
rachel_green Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
monica_geller Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
rachel_green No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
monica_geller Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
chandler_bing Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
gary@phoebe_buffay Hey!
all@ Hey!
gary We have great news!
phoebe_buffay We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
all@ Congratulations! Congrats!
phoebe_buffay I know, I'm so excited!
gary So am I!
phoebe_buffay Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
gary Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
phoebe_buffay Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
gary All right.
monica_geller So you're moving in with him. What happened?
phoebe_buffay I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
monica_geller Why, do you write him a lot?
phoebe_buffay No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
all@ Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
gary Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
phoebe_buffay No, nothing.
gary Oh really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
gary Nothing at all?
phoebe_buffay No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
gary Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh!
gary Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
gary So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
gary In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
phoebe_buffay Umm, yeah! Today's.
gary 'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
phoebe_buffay Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
gary Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
gary Phoebe
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
gary Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
phoebe_buffay That's so sweet.
gary Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just - I want you to be happy
phoebe_buffay Living with you would make me happy.
gary Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
phoebe_buffay No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
gary Are you sure?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
gary Oh that's great!
phoebe_buffay Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
rachel_green Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
woman_1 Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
rachel_green It's not a baby! It's a cat!
woman_1 Eew! It's creepy looking!
rachel_green Oh no! No! It's actually - it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
woman_1 No, I hate cats.
rachel_green Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
woman_2 Wow! What an unusual cat!
rachel_green Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
woman_2 Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
rachel_green Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
woman_2 What?!
rachel_green Okay, a thousand.
woman_2 I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
rachel_green Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
woman_2 Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
rachel_green Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
dr_ross_geller I'm starving!
monica_geller Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
joey_tribbiani I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
monica_geller Please! I made this game what it is.
chandler_bing Not fun anymore?
dr_ross_geller I'm still hungry!
monica_geller All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
dr_ross_geller I am!
monica_geller All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
monica_geller Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
rachel_green It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
dr_ross_geller Oh, thank God!
joey_tribbiani Did you get your money back?
rachel_green Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
monica_geller Wow! You made a profit!
gunther I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
rachel_green Oh yeah, there you go.
gunther Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
rachel_green Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
gunther Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
gary I really like waking up with you.
phoebe_buffay I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
gary That would be great!
phoebe_buffay We could have breakfast in bed
gary Wait, just a second.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Oh! Oh no.
monica_geller All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
phoebe_buffay Oh good, you're all up.
rachel_green Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, that's over.
all@ What?!
chandler_bing Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
phoebe_buffay He shot a bird!
chandler_bing Oh that is over!
all@ That's terrible! I'm sorry!
rachel_green Phoebe, are you okay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey, here Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Nah, I don't feel like playing.
monica_geller It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
all@ All right. Okay. I'm starving!
rachel_green Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
monica_geller Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
chandler_bing You guys wanna eat here?
all@ Yeah! As long as we're here!
joey_tribbiani Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
rachel_green Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
dr_ross_geller I know. My arm is killing me.
rachel_green No, I meant with the dropper over here.
chandler_bing Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
