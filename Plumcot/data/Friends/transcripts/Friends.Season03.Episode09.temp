the_guys Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
phoebe Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
the_guys We will.
monica Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
rachel No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
monica Every year.
phoebe Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things.
ross Halftime.
joey Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
rachel Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
phoebe Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
joey Great, you can cover Chandler.
chandler No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
joey Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
chandler That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
joey Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
chandler Yeah, all right, I'll play.
phoebe Yay!!
rachel Let's do it! Ross?
ross What?
rachel Do you wanna play football?
ross Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
joey Says who? Your mom?
monica_and_ross Yeah.
monica Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
chandler No, no, no, you say that proudly.
monica Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
ross It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
monica To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
ross Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
monica I won the game.
ross Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
rachel Um, there was a Geller Cup?
ross Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
chandler And was the curse lifted?
ross Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
monica Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
ross Can I see you for a second?
monica Once!!
ross All right, we're gonna play.
chandler But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
monica Okay. Let's bring it in.
rachel Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
ross Here you go.
rachel That almost hit me in the face.
joey All right, we have to pick captains.
chandler And then Tineals.
phoebe Okay, so how do we decide that?
monica Well, why don't we just bunny up.
rachel_chandler_and_joey What?
monica_and_ross Bunny!
monica Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
joey Thank you.
rachel Monica, I'm your best friend.
ross Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
rachel Ross!
monica Phoebe.

rachel You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
ross Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
monica All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.

margha It is okay, if I stay and watch?
chandler_and_joey Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
chandler Well, that went well.
joey I think so.
chandler Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
joey Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
chandler Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
joey Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
chandler Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
joey Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
chandler Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
ross Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
rachel Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
ross Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
rachel Can I see that for second.
ross Yeah.
ross Okay. Hut! Hike!
joey Fumble!
joey What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
chandler Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
joey All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
chandler Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
monica All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!

chandler Before!!
rachel Now, does it really matter?
all Yes!!
phoebe Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
ross Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
monica Does so count!
ross Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
phoebe Oh my God!
monica Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
ross Oh-ho, okay.
monica Dead leg!!
ross Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
phoebe Woo-yay!!
monica No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
ross Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
monica Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
ross Oh really! Why is that?
monica Because the winner gets this!
ross The Geller Cup.
chandler Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
all Yeah.
chandler Okay, good.
ross Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
monica When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
ross That cup is mine!
monica No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
rachel All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
monica Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
joey It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
monica All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
joey What are you gonna do?
monica All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
joey Okay.
monica Break!
joey Here you go!
ross Chandler! Chandler!
chandler Hi.
monica Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
ross Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
monica What?! I just touched him and he went over.
ross Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
phoebe I love this game!!
ross Hey, where'd you get that?
rachel I went really long.
monica Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
ross It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
monica You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
monica Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
ross What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
monica Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
ross Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
rachel I can not believe your trading me!!
monica Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
rachel Are you gonna let me play?
monica All right then.
margha The game is over, we eat now?
chandler No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
joey Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
ross Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
chandler No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
joey Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
chandler And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
joey Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
margha Oh, my.
ross Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
joey Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
chandler Fine with me.
ross Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
chandler_and_joey What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
margha Which do I like?
ross Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
margha Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
chandler Yes!!
joey Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
chandler Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
margha I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
chandler You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
margha I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
chandler Wh-what?
margha I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
joey Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
chandler Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
ross Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
chandler We're not gonna lose to girls.
ross Hey! It's 42-21!
joey This sucks, I was just up by that much!
monica Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
monica We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
phoebe Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
monica Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
rachel Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
phoebe All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
monica All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
rachel No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
monica Honey, there's a reason.
rachel God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
phoebe Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
monica All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
rachel Thank you! Break!
monica Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
the_guys One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
rachel I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
monica No! I'm not okay!
rachel I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
joey Thirty seconds left on the timer!
chandler Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
monica Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
phoebe Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
monica All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
rachel Okay.
monica Break!
rachel I got a touchdown! We did it!!
chandler Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
phoebe Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
ross Let go! Let go!
monica Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
chandler Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
monica Ow!!
rachel We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
phoebe Isn't there a national football league.
chandler Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
rachel Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
phoebe Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
joey When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
monica Let go!
ross No! You let go!
monica No!
ross How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
monica I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
ross Hey! It's starting to snow.
ross Gimme the this!
monica Let go!
