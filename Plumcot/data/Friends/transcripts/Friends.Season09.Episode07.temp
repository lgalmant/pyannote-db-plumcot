ross And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Yes we were! Yes we were! Come here gorgeous. Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. Big baby butt! I like big butts. I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... I'm a terrible father!
chandler Hi!
joey Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
chandler How come?
joey Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
monica What do you do with your money now?
joey Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
chandler Do you have any ideas?
joey Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
monica Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
joey Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say
monica Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!
joey Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
monica Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
chandler Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
monica My dad told me. They play golf together.
chandler Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
phoebe Hi!
rachel_and_monica Hey!
phoebe Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
monica Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
phoebe Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
monica They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
phoebe They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
rachel Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
phoebe Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say "neither".
rachel_and_monica Oh God, neither!
monica I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
rachel Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like
monica You went out with Wallis Pincer?
rachel Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
monica I knew you didn't get a 1400!
rachel Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
phoebe So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
rachel Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
monica She said WHAT?
phoebe That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!
rachel Hi.
ross Hi.
rachel I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
ross Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
rachel You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
ross Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.
rachel Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
ross I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
rachel You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
ross But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
rachel owwwww...
ross Please don't take her away from me!
catherine Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
joey Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
chandler So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
catherine Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
chandler mmm That's enough about you!
joey Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
catherine All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...
chandler No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
catherine Oh... Okay, sorry!
joey Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
chandler We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?
joey You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.
chandler Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
joey What?
chandler There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
joey Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
chandler Get there faster!
mike Wow! You look like... like my mom.
phoebe I'm wearing pantyhose!
mike Great! Come on in!
phoebe Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
mike No, my parents are rich.
phoebe Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!
mike Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents
phoebe Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
bitsy It's so nice to finally meet you!
phoebe And you... Your home is lovely.
bitsy Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
phoebe Holy crap!
bitsy Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
phoebe Oh, try and stop me!
mike Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
phoebe I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
mike Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not Phoebe...
phoebe Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
mike Well, come on...
theodore Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
bitsy Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?
phoebe Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?
phoebe God! God! This is not going well.
mike No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
phoebe Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
mike Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
phoebe So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
theodore Oh... Well...
phoebe Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
theodore Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
phoebe Yeah I bet! Look out!
theodore OH! OWWWWW!
phoebe Oh my God, are you okay?
theodore I recently had surgery.
phoebe I'm so sorry!
theodore No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
phoebe I really, really am sorry.
theodore How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
mike Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
phoebe Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
mike But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
phoebe Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
mike Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
phoebe Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
bitsy Well, not at all...
phoebe Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
bitsy Thank you, I think so too.
phoebe Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
bitsy Is he really?
phoebe Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
bitsy E-e-excuse me?
phoebe Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
bitsy That's... my boy.
mike Awesome!
chandler I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
joey Hey dude, what's up?
chandler Don't judge me, I'm only human!
joey Did you take that tape?
chandler I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
joey I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
chandler Some girl...!?
joey She hot?
chandler Yeah...!?
joey How did she get me to settle down?
chandler Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?
joey Guess I don't know. My experience
chandler Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
joey What? Whoo... What?
chandler Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
joey All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
chandler Why am I hearing cheering?
joey Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
chandler Football? Just football?
joey Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
chandler It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
joey You don't wanna see what I just saw!
monica What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
rachel Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo...
ross Hey!
rachel Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
ross Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
rachel Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
ross You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
rachel Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
phoebe ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
mike Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
phoebe Oh, Pervert Parade?
mike No...
phoebe Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
mike Stop!
phoebe Oh God! Is that veal?
mike Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
bitsy Oh!
phoebe Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
mike Phoebe you don't have to eat...
phoebe No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals
mike So...? What do you think?
monica So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
chandler Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
monica That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
joey Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.
monica Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
chandler Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
monica Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
chandler This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
monica Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
chandler Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
monica Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
chandler Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
monica Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
chandler Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
monica THAT'S NOT ME!
chandler What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
monica That bastard taped over me!
chandler Is that a problem?
monica I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
theodore I can't imagine what he sees in her.
bitsy She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. Oh, hello dear...
mike Hey, what's going on?
bitsy We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
mike A little better.
bitsy By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
theodore You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.
mike I'm not interested.
bitsy Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
mike All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
bitsy Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!
mike So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
bitsy The woman you what?
phoebe Yeah... The woman you what?
mike The woman I love... I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
phoebe I love you too...
mike You do?
phoebe YEAH...! How great is this...?
mike Wanna get out of here?
phoebe Okay.
mike Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
phoebe I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And here's something rich
ross She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
rachel So fellas
ross Yeah!
rachel fellas
ross Yeah!
rachel has your girlfriend got the butt?
ross Hell yeah!
rachel So shake it!
ross Shake it!
rachel Shake it!
ross Shake it!
rachel Shake that nasty butt...
ross Baby got back
rachel One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
ross Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
