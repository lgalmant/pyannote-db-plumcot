chandler_bing Ohh. Mmm.
rachel_green Hi.
chandler_bing Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
rachel_green Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
chandler_bing It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
rachel_green Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
chandler_bing I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
rachel_green Why, why not?
chandler_bing Because it's too delicious.
rachel_green Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
chandler_bing No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry what?
joey_tribbiani All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
chandler_bing So
joey_tribbiani Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
phoebe_buffay Absolutely!
joey_tribbiani I'll see you at 8:00.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
chandler_bing Oh, what's at 8:00?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
dr_ross_geller Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
phoebe_buffay Duly noted.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
monica_geller What are you talking about?
dr_ross_geller Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
monica_geller You were invited?!
dr_ross_geller No.
monica_geller My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
chandler_bing Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
dr_ross_geller Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
monica_geller Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
chandler_bing I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
phoebe_buffay Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
rachel_green Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
phoebe_buffay Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
rachel_green "Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
phoebe_buffay Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
joey_tribbiani Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
phoebe_buffay So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
phoebe_buffay I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
joey_tribbiani Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
phoebe_buffay Well, it does.
joey_tribbiani Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
phoebe_buffay Okay, you wore me down.
dr_ross_geller Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
joey_tribbiani The Ross-Is that back?!!
rachel_green Hi!
chandler_bing Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
rachel_green So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
chandler_bing I can't seem to say goodbye.
rachel_green Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
chandler_bing Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
rachel_green It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
chandler_bing Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
rachel_green Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
chandler_bing Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
rachel_green Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
joey_tribbiani Awww! Mel Torme died.
monica_geller Joey, that paper's like a year old!
joey_tribbiani Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
monica_geller Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
dr_ross_geller Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
monica_geller Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
dr_ross_geller Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
monica_geller Joan?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
monica_geller Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
joey_tribbiani Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back
dr_ross_geller Not broad backed!
monica_geller Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
dr_ross_geller What? I can't cancel on Joan!
monica_geller Why not?!
dr_ross_geller Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
monica_geller Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
dr_ross_geller Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
joey_tribbiani Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
monica_geller We'll see.
chandler_bing Well, thank you for lunch.
rachel_green What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
chandler_bing So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
rachel_green Its still there!
chandler_bing Mrs. Braverman must be out.
rachel_green She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
chandler_bing By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
rachel_green No that could kill her.
chandler_bing Well, we don't want that.
rachel_green No so we're protecting her.
chandler_bing But we should take it.
rachel_green But we should move quick.
chandler_bing Why?
rachel_green Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
chandler_bing Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! That's David!
monica_geller David who?
phoebe_buffay David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
david Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
david Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
david Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
phoebe_buffay Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
david Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
david Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
david Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
phoebe_buffay Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
david Really? Because I think about you all the time.
phoebe_buffay Really?
david I mean, there's a statue in Minsk
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
david That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
david Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
phoebe_buffay Yes! Oh no!
david Oh. Uh, what?
phoebe_buffay I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
david Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm
monica_geller Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
monica_geller What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
monica_geller So! He'll understand!
phoebe_buffay No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
monica_geller God, you are so strong.
phoebe_buffay Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
rachel_green Oh my God! That is so good!
chandler_bing I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani What do you got there?
rachel_green Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
chandler_bing What are you doing tonight?
joey_tribbiani Huh? Uh
chandler_bing Dude! Dude!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
chandler_bing Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
joey_tribbiani What?! Tonight?!
chandler_bing That's what Monica said.
joey_tribbiani After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
dr_ross_geller Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
monica_geller Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
the_wedding_guest Hi!
monica_geller I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
the_wedding_guest Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
monica_geller Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
dr_ross_geller Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
monica_geller So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
the_second_guest We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
monica_geller Okay, you're fine.
the_waiter Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
the_waiter Are you guys ready?
phoebe_buffay Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
the_waiter Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
the_waiter And for you sir?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
the_waiter It's uh, it's already been roasted.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
phoebe_buffay Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
the_waiter Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
joey_tribbiani Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Huh?
joey_tribbiani You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
joey_tribbiani Y'know-y'know what I really want?
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
the_waiter Any progress?
joey_tribbiani Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
phoebe_buffay God Joey, this is taking forever!
joey_tribbiani What's the rush? What?
phoebe_buffay W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa, what is it?
phoebe_buffay Well... It's a date.
joey_tribbiani A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
phoebe_buffay Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
joey_tribbiani No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
phoebe_buffay That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
joey_tribbiani Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
phoebe_buffay She was?
joey_tribbiani Well, she graduated from high school!
phoebe_buffay Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
joey_tribbiani Fine!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Fine!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
joey_tribbiani What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
david Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
david Well, I'm very glad you're here.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
chandler_bing Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
rachel_green Mm-mmm.
chandler_bing I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
rachel_green Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
chandler_bing Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
rachel_green What?! What?!
chandler_bing Oh yes!
rachel_green Wait a minute!
chandler_bing Oh yes!
rachel_green Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
chandler_bing Oh yes! Oh yes!
rachel_green You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
chandler_bing Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
rachel_green What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
chandler_bing What do we use to split it?
rachel_green Okay! All right, pick a half.
chandler_bing Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured
rachel_green Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
chandler_bing All right, I'll pick that one.
rachel_green That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
chandler_bing Ohhh!
rachel_green Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
chandler_bing Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my
the_woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode11 Ross, sweetheart!
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
aunt_millie Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
monica_geller Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
dr_ross_geller Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
monica_geller Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
dr_ross_geller That bitch!
frannie Monica! What
monica_geller Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
dr_ross_geller Hi Frannie, congratulations.
monica_geller You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
frannie I believe you know my husband.
dr_ross_geller So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
david Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
phoebe_buffay Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like
david July. Umm,
phoebe_buffay That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
david Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
phoebe_buffay That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
david Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
phoebe_buffay You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
david I-I do though.
phoebe_buffay I do too.
david Bye Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
phoebe_buffay No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
joey_tribbiani Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
phoebe_buffay Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
joey_tribbiani Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
phoebe_buffay Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
joey_tribbiani I can give it a shot.
rachel_green Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
chandler_bing Stick to your side!
rachel_green Hey, come on now!
joey_tribbiani All right, what are we havin'?
monica_geller Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
dr_ross_geller What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
aunt_millie Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
dr_ross_geller Well
aunt_millie Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
dr_ross_geller Why?! Why on the lips?!
