rach Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.
joey I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
mnca You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
phoe Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
joey Here it is, here it is. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
chan OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
phoe OK. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
chan Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
ross I don't want to.
rach Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
ross Yeah.
joey Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
ross Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
joey No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
mnca Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... sucking.
joey When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
ross Hiiiiii.
phoe Are... are you OK?
ross Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
mnca Maybe.
ross Don't toy with me.
fbob Geller!
ross Hey, Fun Bobby!
fbob Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
ross Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
mnca You and me both.
fbob Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
phoe Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
fbob Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
joey No, I'm alright man. Really.
fbob No, I'm picking you up.
joey Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
fbob OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
mnca OK, I'll see you later babe.
fbob Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
fbob See ya.
all Bye! See you later!
phoe Fun Bobby is so great.
mnca Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
phoe Half full of looooovvvvve.
mnca And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
phoe Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
rach We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
mnca Really? I only had two glasses.
joey I just had a glass.
phoe Two.
rach I had one glass.
chan I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
rach OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
ross Oooooh.
joey Ooooooh.
mnca So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
ross Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
phoe Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
joey Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
mnca Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
mnca Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
rach Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
mnca Mmmm, no.
rach Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
fbob Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
phoe Um, cake.
rach Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
mnca You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
fbob Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
mnca Bobby.
fbob Yeah, OK.
mnca Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
fbob OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
mnca So, what are you saying now?
fbob I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
phoe Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
fbob I am gonna try and quit drinking.
phoe Ooohh, why?
chan Hey.
joey Hey.
mnca Hey.
phoe Hey.
chan Guess who's back in show business.
phoe Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
chan No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
phoe Oh, no.
chan OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
joey Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
phoe Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
chan Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
phoe Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
rach Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
mnca You have other friends?
rach Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
mnca What?
joey With a man?
rach What? What is so strange about me having a date?
joey What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
rach Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
mnca What are you talking about?
rach I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
phoe But you guys came so close.
rach Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
rach Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
russ Hhhhiiiii.
estl Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
estl Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
joey Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
estl Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
joey No.
estl Well, here it is.
joey OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
estl Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
joey Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
estl Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
rach What's the matter?
mnca It's Fun Bobby.
rach What, isn't he sober?
mnca Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
rach Ohhh, OK.
mnca Alright, here you go, sweetie.
fbob Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
mnca Oh God, yes!
fbob There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
phoe That is funny.
fbob I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
mnca Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
fbob Oh yeah. See you guys.
chan Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
mnca Oh.... my... God.
phoe It's not that bad.
mnca Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
phoe OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
rach Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
mnca But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
phoe Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
russ Hi.
chan Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
rach Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
russ OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
phoe Rachel? Um, hi.
rach Hi.
phoe OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
rach Uhh.... waitressing?
phoe Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
rach Huh, Bob Saget?
phoe Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
phoe Oh, my, oh!
ross What? What's wrong?
phoe I, OK....
mnca She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
ross Alright.
chan Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
russ Hi.
ross Hi.
russ Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
ross Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
russ Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
ross A date.
russ Yeah, I'm her date.
ross Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
chan You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
russ Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
ross Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
russ Periodontist.
mnca See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
ross Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
russ Ditto.
ross I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
rach Oh.
ross Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
rach Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
ross Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
rach Well, yeah, this is the deal.
ross OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
rach Um, Russ, you ready?
russ Yeah.
rach Bye.
mnca Bye.
phoe Bye.
ross She's dating. She's dating.
chan Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
ross What do you mean?
mnca Do you not see it?
ross See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
chan Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
ross ....................Yeah.
chan Hey.
joey Hey.
chan Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
joey Well, the part's mine if I want it.
chan Oh my God!
joey Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
chan Oh my... God?
joey Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
chan So, what're you gonna do?
joey Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
chan Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
joey I've never slept with someone for a part.
chan Well is she...
joey Sorry.
chan It's alright. Is she good-looking?
joey Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
chan Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
joey I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
chan Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
joey Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
waiter Can I get you something from the bar?
mnca Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
fbob If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
mnca No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
fbob So the light went out in my refrigerator...
mnca I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
chan Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
russ Dysprosium.
ross Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
chan And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
phoe You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
rach What?
phoe OK honey, you're dating Ross.
rach No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
phoe Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
rach Steve... sleeve!
phoe OK, noone is named Sleeve.
rach Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
ross For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
russ You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
chan OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
russ I know what your problem is.
ross Oh you do, do you?
russ Um-hum, you're jealous.
ross Of... of what?
russ You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
ross Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
russ Hey, you listen.
ross No, no, let me finish.
russ No, let me finish.
ross No, you let me fini...
ross Hi.
russ Hi.
rach Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
rach Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
chan No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
rach I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
chan Me.
rach Why would I have to sleep with you?
chan It's my game. You want the job or not?
chan Hey.
mnca Morning.
ross Where ya goin'?
mnca Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
ross Ooooohhhh.
phoe What's with all the bottles of liquor?
ross What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
mnca Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
rach Oh God, even his knock is boring.
mnca Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
fbob Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
mnca Sure.
fbob This is really hard for me to say.
mnca Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
fbob Oh, no, no, it's about you.
mnca What about me?
fbob I think you may have a drinking problem.
mnca What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
fbob Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
mnca Oh... shoot.
fbob Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
mnca OK.
mnca Take care.
fbob You too.
rach What happened?
mnca Well we... we kinda broke up.
gang Awwwwwwww.
mnca Does anybody want these?
chan I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
joey Hey.
gang Hey!
ross How'd the callback go?
joey It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
chan So what'd you do?
joey Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
ross Good for you.
joey But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
phoe So... and?
joey Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
gang Allright!
joey Alright... I've got to go shower.
russ Hi.
chan Oh, hey.
phoe Hi.
russ I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
chan Yeah, I'm sorry man.
russ Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
phoe Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
russ Oh.
julie Hey.
chan Hey!
phoe Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
julie Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
