chandler Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
monica I know
rachel Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
chandler I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
monica The sun is out!
chandler Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
monica Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
chandler Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
rachel Nooo!
monica Damn it!
ross Walls are pretty thin, guys!
ross Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
rachel Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
ross Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
chandler Not to mention the cold sores.
ross And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
chandler Really?
ross But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
charlie What?
joey He said "erectus"!
charlie You're... you're kidding, right?
joey No, he really said it.
ross .. and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
joey Erectus?
rachel Homo.
ross .. in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
ross Oh, thanks guys!
ross Oh!
ross Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
rachel All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
monica Yeah!
rachel It was really... great!
ross Oh, thank you so much!
joey Yeah, and so funny!
rachel Oh!
ross Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
mike You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
mike Oh... I'm back!
ross Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
phoebe_mike Yeah!
ross Hey! Well...?
charlie You were incredible!
ross Yeah?
charlie You blew them away!
ross Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
charlie I was not!
ross No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
charlie Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
ross I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
ross Look, I took it too far!
monica I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
phoebe Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
monica So, what are we gonna do today?
mike They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
monica Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
chandler I don't think so!
monica Why not?
chandler Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
monica I'm not always that bad!
chandler Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
monica I punched you...?
chandler And...?
monica .. Phoebe...?
phoebe .. and...?
monica I clunked your heads together!
charlie Hey! There you are!
joey Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
charlie I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
joey Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
charlie You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...
joey Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
charlie Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
joey Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
charlie Yeah...
charlie .. is it weird that it's not with each other?
joey Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
charlie I think we need to talk...!
joey Yeah... I think we do..... about what?
monica C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
phoebe All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
monica But then how do we know who wins?
phoebe Nobody wins!
monica So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
chandler I'm not playing with you.
phoebe Yeah, I'm out.
mike I'll play ya!
monica OK!
phoebe Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
chandler She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
mike I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
monica Sure! Got to!
monica Aww!
mike Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
chandler Oh dear God, there's two of them!
mike You're ready to play?
monica Hell, yeah!
chandler Did you know this about him?
phoebe No idea! I though he was soft like you!
mike Wanna make it more interesting?
monica How much were you thinking?
mike Ten bucks a game?
monica Make it fifty!
mike I'll make it a hundred!
monica One thousand...
chandler OK!
mike To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
monica No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
chandler Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
phoebe Monica, you call it.
monica Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
phoebe Tails!
monica Ow, what are the chances!
monica Ha! My point!
mike Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
phoebe He was a lawyer!
alexandra_steele .. all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
rachel Oh! Weather bitch!
rachel It's open! Hi, Joe!
joey Hey...
rachel What, is everything ok?
joey Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
rachel Nooooo, why?
joey Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
rachel Oh, that's crazy!
joey No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
rachel .. yeah, it's true.
joey I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
rachel What, hey!
joey Ok, Rach!
joey I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
rachel W-What are you, what are you talking about?
joey Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
rachel Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
joey I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
rachel Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
joey But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
rachel You know? Forget it!
joey No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
rachel No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
joey Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
rachel Yeah, sure!
joey You like me?
rachel Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
joey That's a huge thing!
rachel Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
joey What... for how long?
rachel Only like a month!
joey A MONTH??
rachel What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
joey I just have one question!
rachel Shoot!
joey What the hell are you doin'???
rachel I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
joey Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
rachel Who...?
joey CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
rachel Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
joey Yeah, he had a paper route.
rachel Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
joey No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
rachel But can it... just... happen a little bit?
joey NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
rachel But why, why not?
joey Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
rachel But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
joey I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
rachel I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
joey NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
rachel It's not a big deal!
joey NO BIG DEAL!
rachel It's so not a big deal!
joey Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
rachel Ok!
rachel Ok, I...
rachel AAAHHHH!
monica Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
mike Do you?
monica Ah, yeah!
mike Do you?
monica Ah, yeaaah!
mike DO YOU?
monica AH YEAAAAH!
chandler Do you really find this attractive on him?
phoebe Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
chandler I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
phoebe C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
monica Oh, damn it!
phoebe I sleep with him!
mike Game, point!
monica Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
mike You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
monica NO, NO, NOOO!
mike And that's how it's done!
chandler Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
monica Best out of three?
mike That's what I'm thinking.
chandler Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
monica Serve the ball, chump!
mike : Serve the ball, chump.
phoebe Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
mr_oberblau I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
ross Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
woman Jarvis?
mr_oberblau Oh, you're back... this is my wife, Nancy.
ross Get Out!
charlie Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
ross Yes, please! So, what's going on?
charlie Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
ross Oh my God, wh-what happened?
charlie Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
ross I knew that was him!
charlie Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
ross Hey, you ok?
charlie I guess. There was hum... there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else.
paleontologist Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
ross Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
charlie Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
professore_clerk Or we could throw you both in now!
ross Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. GO, GO, GO!
mike Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
chandler Ok, look! Enough is enough!
monica No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
chandler Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
monica I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
chandler But...
monica Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
chandler What about the obsessive cleaning?
monica That's just good sense!
monica Aww!
chandler You ok?
monica No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
mike So you forfeit?
phoebe Mike wins?
monica I can't believe it! I lost!
chandler No, you didn't.
monica What?
chandler Because I'm gonna play for ya.
phoebe You can't do that!
mike Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
phoebe Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
monica Honey, you don't have to do this.
chandler Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
monica But... you suck!
chandler You're welcome, sweetheart.
chandler All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
mike Ok!
monica Oh my God! You're good!
phoebe It's like watching porn!
chandler And that's... how... it's done!
monica Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
chandler I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
monica Why?
chandler I don't know.
monica This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
chandler That's why!
charlie Thanks!
ross Hi.
charlie Are they still looking for us?
ross Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
ross I don't think they saw us.
charlie I don't think they did.
charlie Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
ross Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
charlie I think you know.
ross I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
ross I'm sorry... we... we can't.
charlie All right, all right.
ross I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
rachel What?
