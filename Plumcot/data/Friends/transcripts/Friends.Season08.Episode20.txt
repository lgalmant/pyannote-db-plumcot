rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
phoebe_buffay About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
monica_geller Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
rachel_green What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
monica_geller Oh my God, your mother!
rachel_green What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
monica_geller Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
rachel_green My God!
monica_geller Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
phoebe_buffay Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people
monica_geller Oh give it a rest!
rachel_green So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
phoebe_buffay No. Neither is mine.
monica_geller Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
rachel_green Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
phoebe_buffay I know. I know, what's her number?
rachel_green I don't know.
monica_geller Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
sandra_green Oh, hello Monica.
monica_geller Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
sandra_green I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
monica_geller Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
sandra_green For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
monica_geller Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
sandra_green Well all right. I'll see you at four.
monica_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Isn't it at three?
monica_geller Son of a bitch!
chandler_bing Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
joey_tribbiani Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
dr_ross_geller Oh cool!
chandler_bing That's great.
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
chandler_bing You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
joey_tribbiani But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
dr_ross_geller Well do you want some help?
joey_tribbiani Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
dr_ross_geller Awesome!
chandler_bing Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
joey_tribbiani All right! Let's play Bamboozled!
chandler_bing Bamboozled?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
chandler_bing No!
joey_tribbiani All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
dr_ross_geller Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh
joey_tribbiani I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
chandler_bing Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
joey_tribbiani Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
chandler_bing Bogota.
joey_tribbiani It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
chandler_bing What does a Wicked Wango card do?
joey_tribbiani I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
chandler_bing Higher or lower than what?
joey_tribbiani This is embarrassing.
chandler_bing Can you believe how lame this is?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
monica_geller You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
phoebe_buffay What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
monica_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay I'm so glad you could make it.
monica_geller Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
sandra_green Try. There's my little girl.
monica_geller She's still mad.
phoebe_buffay Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
monica_geller Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
phoebe_buffay No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
monica_geller Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
sandra_green Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.
rachel_green Okay.
sandra_green Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper 'cause it would just split her focus.
rachel_green Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
sandra_green It's like you're a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
rachel_green Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
sandra_green Such a sweet woman.
rachel_green Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
sandra_green Oh Rachel!
rachel_green What?
sandra_green I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
rachel_green Wh-wh-what? What?
sandra_green Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
rachel_green Yes. Yes I do.
joey_tribbiani All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
dr_ross_geller The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.
joey_tribbiani Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
dr_ross_geller It's okay, I'm ready.
joey_tribbiani No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
chandler_bing This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath
joey_tribbiani Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
chandler_bing Let me see that.
joey_tribbiani This one right here.
chandler_bing Triscadecaphobia.
dr_ross_geller The fear of Triscuts!
joey_tribbiani No! No, fear of the number 13.
chandler_bing Fear of Triscuts?
dr_ross_geller It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
joey_tribbiani All right Chandler, you're up.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
chandler_bing This game makes no sense!
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
chandler_bing Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
joey_tribbiani All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
chandler_bing Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
joey_tribbiani You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
chandler_bing Either, it makes no difference.
joey_tribbiani Choose, you jackass!
chandler_bing I'll take a card.
joey_tribbiani Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
dr_ross_geller What?!
chandler_bing This game is kinda fun.
dr_ross_geller You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you
chandler_bing I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
rachel_green Why did you invite my mother?!
monica_geller What?
rachel_green She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
phoebe_buffay For how long?
rachel_green Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
monica_geller I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
phoebe_buffay She can't hear you.
rachel_green What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
phoebe_buffay Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
rachel_green You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
monica_geller That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
phoebe_buffay I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
monica_geller Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
sandra_green Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.
phoebe_buffay How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
rachel_green Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
sandra_green Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
rachel_green Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
sandra_green Sweetheart I know you're gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
rachel_green But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
sandra_green Really? Remember Twinkles?
rachel_green He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
phoebe_buffay Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
sandra_green Oh look.
rachel_green Wow!
phoebe_buffay Okay, this is from your friend at work.
rachel_green Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
sandra_green Darling, that's a breast pump!
rachel_green Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode20 It's a diaper genie.
rachel_green Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode20 No! It's where you put the dirty ones!
rachel_green Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
sandra_green Oh you're gonna do that ten times a day?
rachel_green What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
sandra_green No dear, that's what babies do.
monica_geller Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
sandra_green Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
rachel_green I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
sandra_green You can't leave a baby alone!
rachel_green Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode20 It's actually a bassinet.
rachel_green Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
joey_tribbiani In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
chandler_bing Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
joey_tribbiani Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
chandler_bing Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
joey_tribbiani Yes!
chandler_bing I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
joey_tribbiani Wise choice, how many rungs?
chandler_bing Six!
joey_tribbiani That noise can only me one thing.
chandler_bing Hungry monkey.
dr_ross_geller Hungry monkey! Haaa! I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
joey_tribbiani Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
chandler_bing Tell it to the Time Turtle!
dr_ross_geller Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
joey_tribbiani Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
dr_ross_geller I'd like to spin the wheel!
chandler_bing Oh come on!!
joey_tribbiani All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
dr_ross_geller Is there a hopping bonus?
joey_tribbiani Of course!
joey_tribbiani Who invented bifocals?
dr_ross_geller Ben Franklin.
joey_tribbiani Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
dr_ross_geller Queen Victoria.
joey_tribbiani Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
dr_ross_geller Noooo!!! Every time!!!
joey_tribbiani Now, over to Chandler.
chandler_bing I'd like a Google Card.
joey_tribbiani Are you sure?
chandler_bing Yes! No! Google!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
chandler_bing Nooo!!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!!
chandler_bing This is the best game ever!!!
rachel_green So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
sandra_green Of course I am!
rachel_green Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
sandra_green No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
rachel_green Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
sandra_green I'm going to the bathroom.
rachel_green Okay.
sandra_green Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.
monica_geller It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
dr_ross_geller I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
phoebe_buffay Not if you were here.
dr_ross_geller Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
rachel_green Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
dr_ross_geller A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
rachel_green No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
dr_ross_geller Uh, what?
rachel_green Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
dr_ross_geller What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
sandra_green Hi Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hi roomie!
man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode20 Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
joey_tribbiani It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
ray And this is Duncan and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
joey_tribbiani Rightie-O Ray!
ray Whenever you're ready.
joey_tribbiani Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
erin Wayne Gretzky.
joey_tribbiani Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
ray Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules? We've eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
joey_tribbiani What-Why?!
ray Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.
joey_tribbiani Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
ray Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.
joey_tribbiani Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
ray Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
joey_tribbiani Let's play Bamboozled!
sandra_green ...and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
dr_ross_geller Well we...we don't have a garage.
sandra_green Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
sandra_green Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
rachel_green I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
dr_ross_geller I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
rachel_green Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
phoebe_buffay No, not a thing.
monica_geller It's frightening.
dr_ross_geller Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
sandra_green That's true. You do have another child.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
sandra_green With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
dr_ross_geller That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
sandra_green Well then you really don't need me to live with you.
dr_ross_geller Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed.
sandra_green You're gonna be a great father.
dr_ross_geller Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
rachel_green Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
rachel_green I hope you're going somewhere with this.
dr_ross_geller Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you.
rachel_green Thank you.
sandra_green All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
sandra_green Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.
monica_geller You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
phoebe_buffay Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
monica_geller Y'know what? You're-you're right.
phoebe_buffay Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
monica_geller Really?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh!
monica_geller Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
sandra_green Spiteful?!
monica_geller That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
phoebe_buffay Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up
monica_geller So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!
phoebe_buffay You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
monica_geller Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
phoebe_buffay You should be!
monica_geller Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
phoebe_buffay You got it!
monica_geller Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
rachel_green Okay! I'm ready.
dr_ross_geller You sure?
rachel_green Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
dr_ross_geller All right then. Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
rachel_green Uh, put your elbow in it.
dr_ross_geller Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
rachel_green Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
dr_ross_geller That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
rachel_green Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
dr_ross_geller Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
rachel_green A card! A card! I pick a card!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
