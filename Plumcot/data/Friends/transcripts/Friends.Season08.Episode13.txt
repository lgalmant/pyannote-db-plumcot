joey_tribbiani All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
rachel_green Hi, sweetie.
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
monica_geller Hi.
chandler_bing Are you, are you high?
monica_geller I just had the most amazing bath.
chandler_bing Really? I don't like baths.
monica_geller Wait, you like them with me.
chandler_bing Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
monica_geller Oh, baths are so relaxing!
chandler_bing Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
monica_geller How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
chandler_bing Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
joey_tribbiani Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
chandler_bing Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
joey_tribbiani Well, neither.
chandler_bing Oh my God, what's up?!
joey_tribbiani I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
chandler_bing Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
joey_tribbiani All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
chandler_bing Do you?
joey_tribbiani It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
chandler_bing In London?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
joey_tribbiani You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
chandler_bing If that.
rachel_green Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
dr_ross_geller Right.
phoebe_buffay Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
dr_ross_geller No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
rachel_green Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
dr_ross_geller And smart!
rachel_green Popular.
dr_ross_geller With an aptitude for science.
phoebe_buffay Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
rachel_green Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
dr_ross_geller Really? Me too!
phoebe_buffay Me too!
rachel_green Really?!
phoebe_buffay Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
dr_ross_geller Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
rachel_green Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
dr_ross_geller Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
rachel_green Okay fine, what do you have?
dr_ross_geller Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.
rachel_green Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, by Sandrine.
dr_ross_geller You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
rachel_green I'm really, really not.
phoebe_buffay How-how about you each get five vetoes?
dr_ross_geller All right.
rachel_green All right.
dr_ross_geller That sounds fair.
rachel_green Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
dr_ross_geller Veto.
rachel_green Why?
dr_ross_geller Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
phoebe_buffay I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
dr_ross_geller Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
rachel_green Ross, why do you hate our child?
dr_ross_geller Fine, you go.
rachel_green Okay, James.
dr_ross_geller Huh.
rachel_green But only if it's a girl.
dr_ross_geller Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
rachel_green Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
dr_ross_geller Veto. Stewart?
rachel_green Veto. Sawyer?
dr_ross_geller Veto. Helen?
rachel_green Veto.
phoebe_buffay Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
chandler_bing Sex on the balcony?
monica_geller No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
chandler_bing What is it?
monica_geller I drew you a bath!
chandler_bing Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
monica_geller Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!
chandler_bing Well, this does butch it up a bit.
monica_geller I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
chandler_bing All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
monica_geller Absolutely.
monica_geller Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
chandler_bing All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
monica_geller So?
chandler_bing Oh my God.
monica_geller I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
chandler_bing I'm going to need a bigger boat.
dr_ross_geller I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
rachel_green Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
dr_long Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
dr_ross_geller Uh, no. No, we're not.
rachel_green But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
dr_long That's right. But if you don't want to know
dr_ross_geller No, no, we want to wait, right?
rachel_green Right. Right.
dr_long Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo.
rachel_green So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
dr_ross_geller What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
rachel_green Third one from the left?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller You're looking!
rachel_green I didn't!
dr_ross_geller I saw you!
rachel_green Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
dr_ross_geller Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
rachel_green Okay, but Ross just listen to me
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
rachel_green But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
dr_ross_geller Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
rachel_green Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
monica_geller Hello?
chandler_bing I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
monica_geller You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
chandler_bing I'm in the bathtub.
monica_geller Oh. What's wrong?
chandler_bing I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
monica_geller Okay, let's talk about something else.
chandler_bing Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
monica_geller Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and
chandler_bing I had the exact same conversation.
monica_geller You did? What was he talking about?
chandler_bing I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
monica_geller That was a long night.
chandler_bing All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
monica_geller Okay, he was talking about rules.
chandler_bing Uh-huh.
monica_geller Umm, and looking at people differently.
chandler_bing He didn't say anything about that to me.
monica_geller What did he tell you?
chandler_bing He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
monica_geller Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
chandler_bing But what did he mean by rules?
monica_geller Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
chandler_bing Because he was looking at her differently.
monica_geller And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
chandler_bing My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
phoebe_buffay You guys?
monica_geller Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!
chandler_bing You don't say anything.
monica_geller Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
chandler_bing I'm not going to let you say anything.
monica_geller You just stay here!
chandler_bing Oh, God!
phoebe_buffay Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
monica_geller Oh, you had that?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
monica_geller I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
phoebe_buffay Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
phoebe_buffay What?
monica_geller Nothing.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
phoebe_buffay Fine.
monica_geller It's a humdinger!
phoebe_buffay Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
monica_geller Somebody likes you!
phoebe_buffay Is it Chandler?
monica_geller No!
phoebe_buffay Well, then tell him to stop staring!
monica_geller It's Joey!
phoebe_buffay Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
monica_geller Is it something you'd be interested in?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.
monica_geller I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
phoebe_buffay Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
monica_geller Not Chandler, just Joey.
phoebe_buffay Sure.
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
dr_ross_geller Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
rachel_green I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
dr_ross_geller I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
rachel_green I would-Sequoia?
dr_ross_geller Veto.
rachel_green Fine.
dr_ross_geller Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
rachel_green But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
dr_ross_geller Not like this!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey. Well, what's up?
phoebe_buffay Umm, Joey, I know.
joey_tribbiani What?
phoebe_buffay I knooow.
joey_tribbiani Whaaat?
phoebe_buffay I know about your feelings.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God. You do?
phoebe_buffay Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
joey_tribbiani I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
phoebe_buffay For God sakes, it's Rachel!
joey_tribbiani I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
phoebe_buffay Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
joey_tribbiani What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
joey_tribbiani She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
phoebe_buffay Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
joey_tribbiani You think?
phoebe_buffay Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
phoebe_buffay That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
joey_tribbiani Not really.
phoebe_buffay Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
dr_ross_geller So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller That's right. The student has become the master.
rachel_green Ross, I swear, I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
rachel_green A what?!
dr_ross_geller You really didn't know?
rachel_green We're having a girl?
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green That's what you just said!
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green You said girl!
dr_ross_geller Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
rachel_green I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
dr_ross_geller I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
rachel_green Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth
dr_ross_geller Permission to veto.
rachel_green Yes, please.
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Do I smell essential oils?
monica_geller Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller What do you think you're doing?
chandler_bing L-leaving my troubles behind?
monica_geller I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
chandler_bing Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
monica_geller Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
chandler_bing You told her?!
monica_geller She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
phoebe_buffay Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
monica_geller I don't think I'd care.
phoebe_buffay Really? Lee Majors is hot!
joey_tribbiani Hello?
phoebe_buffay We're in the bathroom!
joey_tribbiani Why?
chandler_bing Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
joey_tribbiani What are you guys doing in here?
monica_geller Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!
chandler_bing You like Rachel?!
joey_tribbiani It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
phoebe_buffay Mazel tov.
rachel_green Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
monica_geller Honey, cover it up with the boat!
dr_ross_geller Hello?
chandler_bing Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
dr_ross_geller Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
rachel_green No, I was waiting for you!
phoebe_buffay Tell us what?
rachel_green We're having a girl.
all@ Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
chandler_bing I'll...I'll get you later!
joey_tribbiani All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
rachel_green Hi, sweetie.
joey_tribbiani I love you.
monica_geller It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
chandler_bing Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
monica_geller I'm not touching you.
chandler_bing You're not?
monica_geller It's the salts.
chandler_bing Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
monica_geller Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
