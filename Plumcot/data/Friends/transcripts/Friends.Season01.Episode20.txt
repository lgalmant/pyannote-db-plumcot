chandler_bing I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
joey_tribbiani No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
dr_ross_geller I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
monica_geller Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
rachel_green Oh, that is so sick.
chandler_bing I feel violated. And not in a good way.
phoebe_buffay How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
chandler_bing I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
monica_geller So have you called her yet?
chandler_bing Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
monica_geller I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
phoebe_buffay Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
chandler_bing Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
joey_tribbiani Her answer machine?
chandler_bing No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
phoebe_buffay So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
chandler_bing Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
monica_geller Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, what's going on?
phoebe_buffay Okay, they're just talking...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
phoebe_buffay No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
dr_ross_geller What? What? What?!
phoebe_buffay That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
chandler_bing And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
all@ Oh!... Right!
chandler_bing Hey Rach!
monica_geller How'd it go?
rachel_green Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
phoebe_buffay Not a good day for birds...
rachel_green Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
dr_ross_geller That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
rachel_green Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
dr_ross_geller That's, that's nice twice!
monica_geller Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
joey_tribbiani Duh, where've you been?
rachel_green Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
chandler_bing Yes!
rachel_green Why?
chandler_bing I have my reasons.
monica_geller Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
rachel_green All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
rachel_green Wow... Wow!
barry_farber Yeah.
rachel_green I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
barry_farber Nooo, it wasn't.
rachel_green Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
chandler_bing Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
monica_geller That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
chandler_bing Hey, I've been honing!
dr_ross_geller What was with the dishes?
chandler_bing Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
monica_geller Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
monica_geller Great, now he's waving back.
joey_tribbiani Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
monica_geller What kinda stuff?
joey_tribbiani Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
phoebe_buffay You cook naked?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
chandler_bing What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
barry_farber What's the matter?
rachel_green Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
barry_farber No, it was. It was very very good.
rachel_green Well, what about Mindy?
barry_farber Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
rachel_green No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
barry_farber Well, if you want, I'll just-I'll just break it off with her.
rachel_green No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
bernice#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode20 Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
barry_farber Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
rachel_green Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
barry_farber We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
rachel_green I had a bra.
bobby Hey, Dr. Farber.
barry_farber All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
rachel_green What?!
bobby I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
chandler_bing Can I use your phone?
monica_geller Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
chandler_bing Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
joey_tribbiani Maybe she never got your message.
phoebe_buffay Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
chandler_bing Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
dr_ross_geller ..desperate, needy, pathetic?
chandler_bing Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
phoebe_buffay How many beeps?
chandler_bing She answered.
monica_geller Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
chandler_bing I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
all@ Hey! Hi!
phoebe_buffay How'd he take it?
rachel_green Pretty well, actually...
monica_geller Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
rachel_green Oh, do I?
monica_geller Uh huh.
rachel_green We ended up having sex in his chair.
monica_geller You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
dr_ross_geller You-you had what?
phoebe_buffay Sex in his chair.
dr_ross_geller What, uh... what were you thinking?
rachel_green I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
dr_ross_geller No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
rachel_green Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
chandler_bing If it helps, I could slide over.
dr_ross_geller It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
phoebe_buffay Where are you going?
dr_ross_geller I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
chandler_bing Hello? Hello?
rachel_green Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
chandler_bing So how's Mindy?
rachel_green Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
monica_geller Brrrrrrr!
chandler_bing Hell is filled with people like you.
joey_tribbiani He's back! The peeper's back!
joey_tribbiani Get down!
rachel_green Get down?
chandler_bing ..And boogie!
rachel_green Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
monica_geller Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
rachel_green Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
rachel_green And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
joey_tribbiani .Naughty!
rachel_green Right, I'll see you guys later...
joey_tribbiani Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
chandler_bing Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
monica_geller Why don't you just take it with you?
chandler_bing Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
monica_geller Why don't you just call her?
chandler_bing I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
monica_geller Do you?
chandler_bing No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
monica_geller Don't you have to pee?
chandler_bing 'S'why I'm dancing...
rachel_green Mindy.
mindy Hey, you.
rachel_green Hey, you.... So, what's up?
mindy Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
rachel_green Sure we should... So.
mindy Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
rachel_green Okay.
mindy Will you be my maid of honour?
rachel_green Of course!
mindy Oh that's so great!
rachel_green Was that all you wanted to ask me?
mindy That's all!
rachel_green Ohhhh!!.What? What?
mindy That's not all.
rachel_green Oh sure it is!
mindy Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
rachel_green Um, what- what would make you think that?
mindy Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
rachel_green Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
mindy Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
rachel_green What? What's what you were afraid of?
mindy Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
rachel_green What?
mindy I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
rachel_green Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
mindy What do you mean?
rachel_green Smell familiar?
mindy Oh no.
rachel_green Oh, I am so sorry.
mindy No me, I am so sorry...
joey_tribbiani Oh my.
dr_ross_geller Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
chandler_bing Ring dammit, ring!
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
joey_tribbiani Hey, you know our phone's not working?
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
chandler_bing I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
monica_geller Just like you told her you did!. Just pointing out the irony.
joey_tribbiani Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
chandler_bing Nngghhh!!!!!!!
joey_tribbiani Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.

monica_geller So she's a woman! So what?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like--Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
monica_geller Joey!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
monica_geller The green dress? Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
monica_geller Nooo!
rachel_green Hey. Got a second?
barry_farber Sure, sure. Come on....in...
mindy Hello, sweetheart.
barry_farber Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
rachel_green Uh, we are here to break up with you.
barry_farber Both of you?
mindy Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
barry_farber I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
rachel_green Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
barry_farber ...Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
rachel_green Even when we were having sex in that chair?
barry_farber I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
rachel_green Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
mindy You did it twice?
rachel_green Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
mindy Okay...
barry_farber Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
bernice#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode20 Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
barry_farber Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
rachel_green Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
mindy Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
rachel_green What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
mindy Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
rachel_green Oh God.
mindy I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
rachel_green And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
monica_geller You okay?
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller Really?
rachel_green Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
monica_geller Aww...
joey_tribbiani Big day.
joey_tribbiani All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
phoebe_buffay You know he's gay?
dr_ross_geller I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
danielle Chandler?
chandler_bing Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
all@ Hi. Hi.
chandler_bing What are you doing here?
danielle Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
chandler_bing ..I'm, I'm okay.
danielle Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
chandler_bing That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
danielle You got it.
chandler_bing Okay.
danielle G'bye, everybody.
all@ Bye.
phoebe_buffay Whoo-hoo!
monica_geller Yeah, there you go!
dr_ross_geller Second date!
chandler_bing ..I dunno.
rachel_green You don't know?!
chandler_bing Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
