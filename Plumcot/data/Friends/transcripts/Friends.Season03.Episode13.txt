monica_geller Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
clerk#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode13 Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
monica_geller Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
dr_richard_burke I can help with that.
monica_geller Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
dr_richard_burke Hi!
monica_geller Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
dr_richard_burke So, you look great.
monica_geller Right.
dr_richard_burke No you do. You... just...
monica_geller What?
dr_richard_burke You've got panties stuck to your leg.
monica_geller That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
dr_richard_burke It's good to see you.
monica_geller It's good to see you too.
monica_geller You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
dr_richard_burke He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
monica_geller Yeah.
dr_richard_burke I missed this.
monica_geller Me too.
dr_richard_burke So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
monica_geller Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
dr_richard_burke Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
monica_geller No, I just I think that it's too soon.
dr_richard_burke No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
chandler_bing Yeah, baby!
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
dr_ross_geller No thanks. I'm 29.
rachel_green Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
dr_ross_geller Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
rachel_green Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
dr_ross_geller Oh come on, not again.
rachel_green I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
dr_ross_geller Hmm.
rachel_green For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
dr_ross_geller Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
rachel_green Right.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
all@ Hey.
joey_tribbiani Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
phoebe_buffay Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
dr_ross_geller And what are you going to do for him?
phoebe_buffay I'm going to let him.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani Cool.
monica_geller Morning.
all@ Hey.
rachel_green Somebody got in late last night.
monica_geller Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
rachel_green When did this happen?
monica_geller Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
phoebe_buffay Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
dr_ross_geller So, are you gonna see him again?
monica_geller Tomorrow night.
rachel_green Monica, what are you doing?
chandler_bing Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
monica_geller It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
joey_tribbiani Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
monica_geller We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
dr_ross_geller Naked friends.
rachel_green Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
rachel_green Do you have any ice?
joey_tribbiani Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
rachel_green Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
joey_tribbiani I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
rachel_green Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
rachel_green But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
joey_tribbiani Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
rachel_green How often do you read it?
joey_tribbiani Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
rachel_green Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
joey_tribbiani The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
rachel_green Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
joey_tribbiani All right, you got it.
rachel_green All right.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
phoebe_buffay Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
chandler_bing Oh, hey.
robert Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hey.

chandler_bing Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
chandler_bing I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
phoebe_buffay I'll have coffee.
robert Yeah, me too.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, make that three.
chandler_bing Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
dr_ross_geller Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
chandler_bing Robert's coming out.
dr_ross_geller What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
chandler_bing No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
dr_ross_geller What?!
chandler_bing The man is showing brain.
dr_ross_geller Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
robert Coffee.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
robert We could write it down for you?
dr_ross_geller No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
chandler_bing Wellll?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, yeah!
chandler_bing What do we do? What do we do?
dr_ross_geller Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
chandler_bing Like an eclipse.
dr_richard_burke So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
monica_geller You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
dr_richard_burke Ew, this feels very weird.
monica_geller You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
dr_richard_burke Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
monica_geller Oops.
dr_richard_burke Okay.
monica_geller Gotta keep squishing.
dr_richard_burke Tomatoes are squishing.
monica_geller Okay.
dr_richard_burke Op.
monica_geller Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
dr_richard_burke Yeah.
monica_geller Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
dr_richard_burke What?
monica_geller Umm, you've got some on your pants.
dr_richard_burke I'll just throw them out.
joey_tribbiani These little women. Wow!
chandler_bing Your liking it, huh?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
dr_ross_geller Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
joey_tribbiani But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
chandler_bing No, actually Laurie's a boy.
joey_tribbiani No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
chandler_bing You mean a three pointer?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
robert So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
robert Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
joey_tribbiani What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
robert Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
phoebe_buffay What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
dr_ross_geller Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
phoebe_buffay You guys!! Come on!
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
phoebe_buffay What do you mean?
robert Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
robert Sure.
monica_geller So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
monica_geller Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
dr_richard_burke You really sure?
monica_geller I'll call you back.
monica_geller So we can be friends who sleep together.
dr_richard_burke Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
monica_geller Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
dr_richard_burke Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
monica_geller Oh.
dr_richard_burke You want me to cancel it?
monica_geller No! No!
dr_richard_burke Okay.
monica_geller 'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
dr_richard_burke Exactly.
robert Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
robert You ready to go to the batting cage?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
robert Oh! Wow! Hey!
chandler_bing Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
robert Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay That's all right, that's well, I figured....
robert Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey! How's it going?
dr_ross_geller Good.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
rachel_green Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
joey_tribbiani Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
rachel_green Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
joey_tribbiani All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
chandler_bing Hmmm, that's very cool.
joey_tribbiani Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
rachel_green Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
chandler_bing I can't believe she cracked your code!
rachel_green All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
rachel_green Eh. Beth dies.
joey_tribbiani Beth, Beth dies?
rachel_green Um-hmm.
joey_tribbiani Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
chandler_bing No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
rachel_green No. She doesn't die.
joey_tribbiani Then why would you say that?!
rachel_green Because, I wanted to hurt you.
robert Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
rachel_green Oh my....
robert Got 'em.
monica_geller Hi.
rachel_green Sorry. I'm sorry.
monica_geller You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
monica_geller What are you smiling at?
rachel_green I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
monica_geller Yeah, right.
dr_richard_burke Hello.
monica_geller I love this friend thing!
phoebe_buffay Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
dr_ross_geller Oh.
phoebe_buffay Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
chandler_bing We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
dr_ross_geller He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
robert Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
robert So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
phoebe_buffay No, I can spot you from here.
robert What?
phoebe_buffay Okay, listen Robert...
dr_ross_geller Hey, don't we have to...
chandler_bing Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
phoebe_buffay Umm, I think you're really, really great...
robert Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
phoebe_buffay I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
gunther Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
monica_geller Ow!
dr_richard_burke Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
richards_date Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
monica_geller Oh my God! Oh my God!
dr_richard_burke Ah well, this is the living room.
richards_date Impressive.
dr_richard_burke All right. This is the kitchen.
richards_date Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
dr_richard_burke The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
richards_date We're still on this side of the door.
dr_richard_burke Um-hmm.
richards_date Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
dr_richard_burke Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
monica_geller So um, who was she?
dr_richard_burke Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
monica_geller Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
dr_richard_burke Well, you seem fine.
monica_geller Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
dr_richard_burke You mean like exclusive friends?
monica_geller Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
dr_richard_burke Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
monica_geller That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
dr_richard_burke Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
monica_geller Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
dr_richard_burke I know I couldn't. So....
monica_geller How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
monica_geller Watch the thorns!
dr_richard_burke Ow!!
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani Beth is really, really sick.
rachel_green Awwww.
joey_tribbiani Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
rachel_green Joey?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
joey_tribbiani Okay.
rachel_green Okay.
