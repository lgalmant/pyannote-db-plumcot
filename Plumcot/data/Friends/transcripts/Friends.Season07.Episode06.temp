monica Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
rachel Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
phoebe I hope it's you.
rachel Me too!
monica First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me
rachel Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
monica Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
phoebe Yes!!! Oh!!
rachel Hypothetically!
phoebe Still.
monica If Phoebe were my maid of honor
rachel Uh-hmm.
monica Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
rachel Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
phoebe Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
monica Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
phoebe Wh-why is that the best part?
monica Because then I don't have to!
rachel Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that
monica I'm really not deciding!
rachel Fine!
woman Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
monica Yeah that's right.
woman Huh, good luck!
phoebe Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
chandler Die Hard still great!
joey Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
chandler What'd you rent?
joey Die Hard 2.
chandler Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
joey Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
ross Joey, we just saw it!
joey And?

chandler Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
ross Well, John McLane had plans!
chandler No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
joey What are you talking about? Bitch.
phoebe Hey Rachel?
rachel Yeah?
phoebe Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
rachel Really?!
phoebe Uh-hmm.
rachel Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
phoebe Oh! Well, if that's what you want
rachel Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
phoebe But why does it even matter?!
rachel Why does it matter so much to you?!
phoebe Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
rachel What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
phoebe You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
rachel Yeah but Phoebe
phoebe And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
rachel Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
phoebe Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
rachel I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
phoebe Oh I know.
rachel Better than Chandler.
ross What happened?!!
joey Well, I don't know!!
ross We fell asleep! That is all.
joey Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
ross I think that would be best.
joey Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
ross Okay. But not about this!
joey No! Never! Never! Bye.
ross No touch! No touch!
monica Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
chandler That's sweet.
monica No, it's more like a good luck.
chandler So uh, what did this woman look like?
monica She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
chandler Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
monica Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
chandler No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
monica What are you doing?
chandler Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
monica Oh my God yes! Who is she?
chandler Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
monica Did you break up with her?
chandler No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
monica Why?
chandler Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow
monica Fat?!
chandler I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
monica You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
chandler Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
monica Well, apparently she does.
chandler Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
joey Hey! What's going on?
rachel Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
joey Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
rachel You have been maid of honor before?!!
phoebe See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
rachel All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
phoebe Na-uh, I am!
rachel How come you are?!
phoebe Because I cared enough to lie!
joey Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
phoebe What are you talking about?
joey Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
phoebe Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
joey Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
phoebe Well, it's better than us deciding.
rachel Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
phoebe No! Coins hate me!
rachel Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
phoebe Hey there, you handsome thing.
ross Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
joey Hi.
ross Just uh, brought back your videos.
joey Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
ross No! No we don't!
joey Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
ross I... I don't know what you are talking about.
joey Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
ross I've had better.
joey Okay! When?!
ross All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
joey Uh-huh!
ross I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
joey I want to do it again.
ross We can't do it again.
joey Why not?
ross Because it's weird!
joey Fine! Do you want something to drink?
ross Sure, what do you got?
joey Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
monica Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
chandler Can you figure out what I'm doing?
monica You're Lewis Posin.
chandler Who?
monica Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
chandler Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
monica No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
chandler What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
monica No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
chandler Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
joey Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
ross No, 10 is the highest.
joey Why is 10 the highest?
ross Because it's the highest. Okay, Rachel you're up first. Situation No. 1: You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
joey I don't want to marry Chandler!
rachel Okay, uh
joey I've got cold feet.
rachel ...it's gonna be okay!
joey No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
rachel Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
joey Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
rachel Thanks!
ross Yes, very nice Rachel.
rachel Thank you judges.
phoebe Ugh, what a kiss ass.
rachel Oh!
joey Okay, Phoebe
phoebe Yes! Your honor?
joey We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
ross When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
phoebe Oh!
joey Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
rachel Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
phoebe Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
ross It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
rachel Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre
ross Go!
rachel Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
ross_and_joey Oh! That's nice.
rachel Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
joey Wow. Good speech.
ross Yeah, it really was!
rachel Aw, thanks!
ross Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
joey Yeah.
phoebe Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
joey And she's back in the game.
chandler Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
julie Hello Skidmark.
chandler It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
monica It's pretty clear.
chandler Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
julie That's why you broke up with me?
chandler You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
joey All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
phoebe Really?! I won!
rachel What?!
ross I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
rachel Well then I demand a recount!
ross Actually, it wasn't that close.
rachel No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
phoebe The coins have finally forgiven me!
rachel Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
phoebe Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
joey Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
ross Yeah?
joey Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
ross Why-why would I care about that?
joey No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
chandler As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
monica Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
chandler I would really love it if could do both.
monica All right, I...I have to ask.
chandler What?
monica Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
chandler What?!
monica Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
chandler A hundred and forty-five pounds.
monica In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
chandler Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
monica Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
chandler Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
monica How?
chandler You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
monica What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
chandler Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
monica Keep going.
chandler So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
monica Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
chandler I'd carry you around in my pocket.
monica I love you.
chandler Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
rachel Hi Pheebs.
phoebe Hi!
rachel Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
phoebe That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
rachel Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
phoebe Oh yeah!
rachel Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case
phoebe Oh that's so sweet thanks.
rachel Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
phoebe Ohh.
rachel And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
phoebe This stuff is great!
rachel Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah
phoebe Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
rachel You do? Why?
phoebe Because I think it means more to you.
rachel But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
phoebe Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
rachel No, I was ten. I just developed early.
phoebe Man alive!
monica Hey, what's going on?
rachel Hey!
phoebe Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
monica Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
rachel Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
joey Great nap.
ross It really was.
joey Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
ross Excuse me.
