chandler This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now.
joey There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
chandler It's Phoebe! Hi!
ursula Hi. Okay, will that be all?
chandler Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
ursula Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I'm here.
joey No, no... how come you are working here?
ursula Right, yeah, 'cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
chandler Can we start over?
ursula Yeah. Okay great. I'm gonna be over here.
chandler_and_joey No, no, no!
ross I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
rachel No, yeah, I've done that.
ross And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
rachel I've never done that.
chandler All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.
joey I'm sayin' I see a difference.
chandler They're twins!
joey I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's... hot!
chandler You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?

phoebe Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
joey Not from where I was standin'.
phoebe where were you standing?
rachel Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?
phoebe It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
ross Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
chandler Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
rachel So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
ross No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
rachel Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird?
ross No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.

chandler Hi, Nina. Come on in.
nina You wanted to see me?
chandler Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers.

chandler Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
nina Your... excuse me?
chandler WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
nina Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
chandler It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute.
ross It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
monica Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
ross Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
monica Great.
ross Relax, I'll fix it.
rachel Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
ross How did he do this?
chandler So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
monica Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's... but obviously someone forgot.
rachel Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
chandler Hey, where you been?
joey I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
chandler Score.
joey She is so hot!
chandler Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
joey Pheebs?
phoebe Yeah?
joey You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
phoebe Why? Why would you wanna... do that?Â  Why?
joey So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
phoebe Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we've grown apart, so, um... I don't know, why not? Okay.
joey Cool, thanks.
ross You okay?
phoebe Yeah I'm fine.
ross You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
ross Sorry.
ross Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
susan Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
ross No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
susan Oh, good. This'll be fun.
teacher Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head.
ross_and_susan What? What? What?
susan I am supposed to be the mommy?
ross Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
susan Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
ross I see. So what do you propose to do?
susan I will flip you for it.
ross Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
susan On your back... Mom.
teacher Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
teacher Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
chandler Mr. D, how's it going, sir?
mr_douglas Ohh, it's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
chandler And?
mr_douglas It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
chandler So what does this mean?
mr_douglas Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department.
chandler Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
mr_douglas Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
chandler Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
nina Are you okay?
chandler Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don't hate me.
nina What?
chandler Would you like to have dinner sometime?

phoebe Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
rachel Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
phoebe Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
rachel Ooh, okay... good.
jamie What is this place?
fran Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and... ..there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
jamie I think we have an answer.
fran What's she doing here?
jamie This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
fran Think she got fired at Riff's?
jamie No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
fran I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right.
jamie It looks like her.
jamie Um, excuse me.
phoebe Yeah?
jamie Hi, it's us.
phoebe Right, and it's me.
jamie So, so you're here too?
phoebe Much as you are.
jamie Your turn.
fran Err... we know what we want.
phoebe Oh, that's good.
jamie All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
fran And some biscottie cookies.
phoebe Good choice.
jamie Definitely her.
fran Yeah.
monica I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
chandler Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
monica Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.
chandler I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?
rachel Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. "Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work?"
joey Hey.
rachel_and_chandler Hey.
chandler You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock any more.
monica I'll get it.
monica Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
mrheckles You're doing it again.
monica We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly.
mrheckles I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep.
rachel You don't even have cats.
mrheckles I could have cats.
monica Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
rachel We'll try to keep it down.
joey Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
phoebe Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
joey Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
phoebe Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
rachel Are you seein' her again tonight?
joey Yep. Ice Capades.
chandler Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
joey I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin' about her.
phoebe That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
joey Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
phoebe Alright, well, maybe now it's not okay.
joey Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
phoebe Okay.
chandler Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
chandler And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
mr_douglas Nina.
nina Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
mr_douglas She's still here.
chandler Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
chandler And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
mr_douglas You're kidding? She seems so...
chandler Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
mr_douglas That's unbelievable.
chandler And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
mr_douglas I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head.
chandler Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
soothing_male_voice ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
teacher Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our final class.
ross Susan, go deep.
carol This is impossible. It's just impossible.
susan What is, honey?
carol What that woman... did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in, that's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in.
ross Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright.
carol Oh, what do you know?Â  No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril?Â  Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
susan Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
susan I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
susan I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
ross I'm gonna be a father.
rachel This is just occurring to you?
ross I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
rachel Oh, you're gonna be great!
ross Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
chandler You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
phoebe Where're you going?
joey Out.
phoebe With?
joey Yes.
phoebe Alright, could I just ask you one question?
phoebe Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
joey Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, okay?
joey You meant sex, right?
nina Do you have a sec?
chandler Ah, sure, Nina. What's up?
nina I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
chandler Oh, well, ah... maybe that's because they're ah... jealous, of us.
nina Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
chandler Ah, well, maybe that's, ah, because you're getting a big raise.
nina I am?
chandler Sure, why not?
nina Oh my god! You're amazing!
chandler Oh, you don't know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?
helen So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
nina What?
chandler Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
chandler Well, I ended up telling her everything.
rachel Oh, how'd she take it?
chandler Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip
monica Okay, I think I get how to do this.
phoebe Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can't, I can't watch.
monica okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
phoebe Okay.
monica Are you alright?
phoebe Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing, it's...
rachel Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
phoebe Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
monica_and_rachel No.
phoebe Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn't even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn't wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
rachel Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
phoebe I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
chandler You're not gonna lose him.
monica Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
phoebe Yeah. Okay.
ross No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
phoebe But he's falling in love with her.
rachel Oh please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious.
phoebe Okay... Okay.
phoebe Oh, okay, oh.
ursula Oh.
ursula Yeah, um, may we help you?
monica Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
rachel No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..I'm takin' 'em down. Okay? Whoa!
monica Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
rachel I'm okay! I'm okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
mrheckles See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
