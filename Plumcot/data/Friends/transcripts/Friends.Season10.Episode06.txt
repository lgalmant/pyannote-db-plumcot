phoebe_buffay Hey...
all@ Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, what's wrong?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
all@ OH!
rachel_green My God!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
dr_ross_geller So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
phoebe_buffay Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
joey_tribbiani Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
all@ Whoo!
phoebe_buffay Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
rachel_green Mmh-mmh!
phoebe_buffay It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
rachel_green Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
phoebe_buffay I would, but you're the last one.
rachel_green GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
phoebe_buffay Oh, my first love!
rachel_green Oh!
monica_geller What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
phoebe_buffay Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
chandler_bing Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
rachel_green Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
phoebe_buffay Oh yes, they are.
chandler_bing Hey honey!
joey_tribbiani Hi sweetie!
chandler_bing Is Monica not here?
joey_tribbiani No.
chandler_bing Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
joey_tribbiani Cool!
chandler_bing Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
joey_tribbiani That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
chandler_bing Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
joey_tribbiani What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
chandler_bing First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
joey_tribbiani I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
chandler_bing Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
joey_tribbiani I'm cold!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
charlie_wheeler Hey!
dr_ross_geller Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
charlie_wheeler Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
charlie_wheeler Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
dr_ross_geller Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
charlie_wheeler Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Why?
charlie_wheeler Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
dr_ross_geller Your ex-boyfriend?
charlie_wheeler Yeah.
dr_ross_geller So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
charlie_wheeler No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
dr_ross_geller Well, if you think it would help.
charlie_wheeler Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
dr_ross_geller Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
charlie_wheeler Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
dr_ross_geller We'll see how dinner goes.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
phoebe_buffay Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
monica_geller Oh, right.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
monica_geller Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up? Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
monica_geller Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
monica_geller Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
phoebe_buffay Why, you don't like her?
monica_geller Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
phoebe_buffay Really? You think?
monica_geller Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
phoebe_buffay Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
monica_geller Damn it, I did not think this through!
chandler_bing Hey you guys.
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Any word on casting yet?
chandler_bing Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
joey_tribbiani What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
rachel_green I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
joey_tribbiani Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
chandler_bing Joe...
joey_tribbiani Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
chandler_bing Fine!
joey_tribbiani Thank you.
chandler_bing Work, Joe!
joey_tribbiani Damn it!
chandler_bing What am I gonna do now?
joey_tribbiani Just pass it to your boss!
chandler_bing He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
rachel_green Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
chandler_bing That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
charlie_wheeler Sorry, looks like it's just him.
dr_benjamin_hobart Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
dr_ross_geller Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
dr_benjamin_hobart So good to see you.
charlie_wheeler Me too.
dr_ross_geller I'm ok.
charlie_wheeler I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
dr_ross_geller It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
dr_benjamin_hobart Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
charlie_wheeler Shall we?
dr_benjamin_hobart Thank you! I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
charlie_wheeler Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place!
dr_benjamin_hobart You weren't there!
dr_ross_geller No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
charlie_wheeler Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?
dr_benjamin_hobart So, tell me about it.
dr_ross_geller Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
dr_benjamin_hobart M-m.
dr_ross_geller See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
dr_benjamin_hobart Break up with Charlie!
dr_ross_geller What?
dr_benjamin_hobart What?
dr_ross_geller Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
dr_benjamin_hobart Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
dr_ross_geller Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
dr_benjamin_hobart I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
dr_ross_geller Are you serious?
dr_benjamin_hobart If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
dr_ross_geller No!
dr_benjamin_hobart Joking it is!
phoebe_buffay Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
monica_geller Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
phoebe_buffay No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
monica_geller Wow, what's the bad news!
rachel_green Who's Gladys?
phoebe_buffay Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
rachel_green Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
monica_geller Huh!
rachel_green Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
monica_geller You know, I would give her up, for you.
rachel_green No, I couldn't let you do that.
monica_geller But I want to.
rachel_green But I don't want you to.
monica_geller But I insist!
rachel_green But I insist harder!
phoebe_buffay Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. Tails! Monica, she's yours!
monica_geller No, that landed in your food!
rachel_green No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
chandler_bing Hey Joe!
joey_tribbiani What's up?
chandler_bing Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
chandler_bing I'm sorry man.
joey_tribbiani But, ehm... you watched the tape?
chandler_bing Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
joey_tribbiani You didn't watch the tape.
chandler_bing What!? Of course I did!
joey_tribbiani Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
chandler_bing I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
joey_tribbiani Well, you lied again!
chandler_bing I watched it!
joey_tribbiani Keep going Pinocchio!
chandler_bing I did!
joey_tribbiani No you didn't!
chandler_bing I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
rachel_green Did you watch the tape?
chandler_bing No!
dr_benjamin_hobart The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?
dr_li Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
dr_benjamin_hobart Interesting.
dr_ross_geller I guess!
dr_benjamin_hobart Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?
dr_biely Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
dr_benjamin_hobart Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
dr_ross_geller What? I... I...
dr_benjamin_hobart Care to venture a guess?
dr_ross_geller May 12th?
dr_benjamin_hobart That's not even kinda close! Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
dr_li Half a dozen.
dr_benjamin_hobart I see, and Dr. Biely?
dr_biely Three for excavation and two for analysis.
dr_benjamin_hobart Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
dr_ross_geller Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
dr_benjamin_hobart No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
dr_ross_geller Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
dr_benjamin_hobart You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
dr_ross_geller um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
dr_benjamin_hobart Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
dr_ross_geller Ok. B - O - S..
dr_benjamin_hobart No, it starts with a silent "M".
dr_ross_geller Oh come on!!
chandler_bing I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
rachel_green But you are a liar.
chandler_bing What did I just say?
joey_tribbiani You still here?
chandler_bing Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
joey_tribbiani Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
chandler_bing Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
joey_tribbiani You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
rachel_green Well, this is going well.
joey_tribbiani Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
joey_tribbiani And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape!
chandler_bing He really is a chameleon.
phoebe_buffay Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
monica_geller Oh, my!
rachel_green Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
monica_geller I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
rachel_green Well, hey! How about right above the TV? That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
monica_geller I like that poster!
phoebe_buffay Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
rachel_green Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
monica_geller Are you still here?
dr_ross_geller Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
dr_benjamin_hobart I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
dr_ross_geller No! Stop!
dr_benjamin_hobart Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
dr_ross_geller Really?
dr_benjamin_hobart Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
dr_ross_geller I have to break up with Charlie?
dr_benjamin_hobart Hey, you got one right!
dr_ross_geller You're crazy.
dr_benjamin_hobart Crazy, or... romantic?
dr_ross_geller Crazy!
dr_benjamin_hobart Ooor...
dr_ross_geller Get out!
rachel_green O-oh my God!
joey_tribbiani What?
rachel_green Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
joey_tribbiani I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
rachel_green Joey, we're not keeping this!
joey_tribbiani But it's an original Buffay...
rachel_green Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
joey_tribbiani Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
rachel_green Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
rachel_green She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
joey_tribbiani GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
monica_geller Hey! I sold that to Joey.
rachel_green Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
monica_geller No, too late. You can't give it back!
rachel_green Yes I can!
monica_geller No you can't. She's yours!
rachel_green She's yours!
monica_geller SHE'S YOURS!
rachel_green She's yours!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green She's mine!
monica_geller She's m-i-i-ne!
rachel_green She's mine!
monica_geller She's mine!
phoebe_buffay You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
rachel_green I want Gladys!
monica_geller She's mine!
rachel_green She's mine!
monica_geller She's mine!
rachel_green She's mine!
chandler_bing Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
joey_tribbiani That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
chandler_bing I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
monica_geller Oh my God!
rachel_green Excellent!
joey_tribbiani Now, what do you say?
chandler_bing Lying is wrong!
joey_tribbiani And?... AND?
chandler_bing I'm a pretty little girl.
phoebe_buffay I knew it!
dr_ross_geller Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
charlie_wheeler Did you get the grant?
dr_ross_geller No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
charlie_wheeler What?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
charlie_wheeler Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
dr_ross_geller Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
charlie_wheeler I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
dr_ross_geller If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
charlie_wheeler Seriously?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
charlie_wheeler Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
dr_ross_geller Damnit!
dr_benjamin_hobart Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
dr_ross_geller I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
dr_benjamin_hobart Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
charlie_wheeler Benji?
dr_benjamin_hobart Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
dr_ross_geller Too little, too late, Benji!
charlie_wheeler I can't believe this.
dr_benjamin_hobart I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
dr_ross_geller No!
charlie_wheeler Yes!
dr_ross_geller What?
charlie_wheeler I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
dr_ross_geller or...
dr_benjamin_hobart Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
charlie_wheeler Maybe...
dr_ross_geller Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
charlie_wheeler Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
dr_benjamin_hobart I'm sorry too...
dr_benjamin_hobart I love you!
charlie_wheeler I love you too!
dr_ross_geller Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
joey_tribbiani Gladys?
rachel_green Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
joey_tribbiani You're mean!
rachel_green Oh, don't be such a baby!
