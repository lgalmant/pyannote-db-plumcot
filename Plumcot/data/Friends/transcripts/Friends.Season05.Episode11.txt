dr_ross_geller Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
joey_tribbiani Chandler.
dr_ross_geller Awww, man! Really?
joey_tribbiani Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
dr_ross_geller That's a good point.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
joey_tribbiani Okay, great!
dr_ross_geller All right.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
phoebe_buffay It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
joey_tribbiani Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.

joey_tribbiani Yeah!
all@ 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
chandler_bing Happy New Year!
monica_geller Happy New Year.
dr_ross_geller Happy New Year, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay You too!
rachel_green Happy New Year, Joey!
joey_tribbiani So did that do anything for ya?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
rachel_green But your divorce isn't even final yet.
dr_ross_geller Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
chandler_bing Do you want us to leave the room, or?
dr_ross_geller Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
phoebe_buffay Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
chandler_bing That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
phoebe_buffay Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
monica_geller She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
dr_ross_geller In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
chandler_bing I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
joey_tribbiani All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
dr_ross_geller Ohh.
phoebe_buffay Really?! How come?
joey_tribbiani Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
phoebe_buffay Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
joey_tribbiani Really? Who-who have you taught?
phoebe_buffay Well, I taught me and I love me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
rachel_green Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
monica_geller Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
rachel_green I don't gossip!
rachel_green Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
monica_geller Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
rachel_green What? They were like this!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode11 I'll see you tomorrow.
dr_ross_geller Okay! Hey!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller I just asked that girl out.
chandler_bing Nice!
joey_tribbiani Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
dr_ross_geller Yes it is. See.
chandler_bing Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
dr_ross_geller That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
chandler_bing Horn-swoggle.
joey_tribbiani You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
chandler_bing No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
joey_tribbiani Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
dr_ross_geller Hi, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
phoebe_buffay Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
dr_ross_geller All right, see you later.
joey_tribbiani See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
joey_tribbiani Umm, okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
chandler_bing What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
phoebe_buffay Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
rachel_green I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
joey_tribbiani Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
phoebe_buffay Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
joey_tribbiani Yes!
phoebe_buffay Then don't touch one!!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
ben_geller Hi!
monica_geller Hi Ben!
ben_geller Auntie Monica!!
chandler_bing Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
rachel_green I think they're very nice.
monica_geller I like 'em.
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
monica_geller I like them a lot.
chandler_bing That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
dr_ross_geller Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
chandler_bing Oh come on!!
dr_ross_geller Okay, seriously, what do you think?
joey_tribbiani You look like a freak.
rachel_green Awful, absolutely awful.
dr_ross_geller What are you, what are you doing?
monica_geller It's my New Year's resolution!
dr_ross_geller What, to blind my child?
monica_geller No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
joey_tribbiani Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
dr_ross_geller My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
elizabeth_hornswoggle No.
dr_ross_geller Okay, it must just be me then.
dr_ross_geller That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
elizabeth_hornswoggle No, go ahead.
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
elizabeth_hornswoggle Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
dr_ross_geller 'Kay!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
joey_tribbiani Yes! Yes, I did.
phoebe_buffay Then do Iceberg!
joey_tribbiani G-sharp.
phoebe_buffay G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
phoebe_buffay No, but you're questioning my method!
joey_tribbiani No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
monica_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
joey_tribbiani Your other student, was you!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
joey_tribbiani Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
phoebe_buffay Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
rachel_green "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
phoebe_buffay Oh, fine! Take his side!
monica_geller I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
chandler_bing Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
monica_geller Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
rachel_green Arghh!!
joey_tribbiani Hello?
dr_ross_geller Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
joey_tribbiani Uhh, Chandler's not here.
dr_ross_geller Well, you can help me!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
dr_ross_geller Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
joey_tribbiani Nice!
dr_ross_geller No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
joey_tribbiani Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
dr_ross_geller Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
joey_tribbiani Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
joey_tribbiani Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
dr_ross_geller Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
dr_ross_geller Hold on.
joey_tribbiani Ross? You okay?
dr_ross_geller They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
joey_tribbiani Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
dr_ross_geller What difference does that make?!
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
rachel_green Joey, do you have a minute?
dr_ross_geller Dude, what am I gonna
joey_tribbiani Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
rachel_green Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
joey_tribbiani Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
rachel_green Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
joey_tribbiani What-what is it, what is it?
rachel_green Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
joey_tribbiani Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
rachel_green Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
joey_tribbiani I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
rachel_green What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
joey_tribbiani And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
rachel_green I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
joey_tribbiani I'm not listening to you!
elizabeth_hornswoggle Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
dr_ross_geller All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
elizabeth_hornswoggle No, let's just leave the lights on.
elizabeth_hornswoggle Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller I had a problem.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
joey_tribbiani Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh!
joey_tribbiani Wow! Cool!
joey_tribbiani Was the chord at least right
phoebe_buffay No!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
dr_ross_geller This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
all@ No. No, you're not a loser.
dr_ross_geller Look at me!
monica_geller Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
dr_ross_geller Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
monica_geller See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green That really is something; that's really cool.
joey_tribbiani Howdy partner!
dr_ross_geller Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
monica_geller Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
rachel_green Good luck, honey!
phoebe_buffay Bye!
rachel_green Hey, uh, Joey?
joey_tribbiani Umm?
rachel_green Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
joey_tribbiani Oh, no!
rachel_green I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
joey_tribbiani Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
rachel_green Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
joey_tribbiani Now? You want me to go over there now?
rachel_green Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Do you know something?
rachel_green Do you know something?
joey_tribbiani I might know something.
rachel_green I might know something too.
joey_tribbiani What's the thing you know?
rachel_green Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
joey_tribbiani I can't tell you what I know.
rachel_green Well then I can't tell you what I know.
joey_tribbiani Okay, fine.
joey_tribbiani You don't know!
