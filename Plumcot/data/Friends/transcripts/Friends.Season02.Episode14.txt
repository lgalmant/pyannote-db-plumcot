dr_ross_geller Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.

phoebe_buffay It's not that bad.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
phoebe_buffay Chandler, Chandler.
chandler_bing I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
dr_ross_geller Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
phoebe_buffay I think she's OK.

dr_ross_geller But, you are.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
rachel_green OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
dr_ross_geller No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
phoebe_buffay Do the claws again.
dr_ross_geller Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
rachel_green Ross, there is no us, OK.
dr_ross_geller No, but.
rachel_green No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.

joey_tribbiani If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
chandler_bing Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
joey_tribbiani Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
chandler_bing OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
joey_tribbiani You know what the.
chandler_bing I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now.
jack_geller You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys.
judy_geller Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
dr_ross_geller No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
jack_geller A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
judy_geller Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
monica_geller Where have you been?
dr_ross_geller Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
monica_geller No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
dr_ross_geller C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
monica_geller Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
judy_geller Why?

dr_ross_geller@monica_geller In the bank.
jack_geller There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
monica_geller Anything larger back there?
chandler_bing I can't believe it.
phoebe_buffay Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
chandler_bing Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
rachel_green Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
phoebe_buffay Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.

chandler_bing Well this one's for you.
joey_tribbiani Get out.
chandler_bing No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.

chandler_bing That's what they'll call us.
dr_ross_geller Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
