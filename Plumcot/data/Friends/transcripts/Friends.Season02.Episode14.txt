monica_geller Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
jack_geller Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.

phoebe_buffay Chandler, Chandler.
chandler_bing I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
dr_ross_geller Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
phoebe_buffay I think she's OK.

phoebe_buffay Do the claws again.
dr_ross_geller Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
rachel_green Ross, there is no us, OK.
dr_ross_geller No, but. . .
rachel_green No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.

joey_tribbiani If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
chandler_bing Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
joey_tribbiani Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
chandler_bing OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
joey_tribbiani You know what the. . .
chandler_bing I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
jack_geller You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys.
judy_geller Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
dr_ross_geller No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
jack_geller A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
judy_geller Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
monica_geller Where have you been?
dr_ross_geller Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
monica_geller No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
dr_ross_geller C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
monica_geller Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
judy_geller Why?
monica_geller Because they made me.
judy_geller You were fired? What're you gonna do?
jack_geller Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller In the bank.
jack_geller There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
monica_geller Anything larger back there?
chandler_bing I can't believe it.
phoebe_buffay Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
chandler_bing Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
rachel_green Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
phoebe_buffay Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
chandler_bing What am I gonna do, huh?
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani How come you have two?
chandler_bing Well this one's for you.
joey_tribbiani Get out.
chandler_bing No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
joey_tribbiani Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
chandler_bing That's what they'll call us.
dr_ross_geller Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
monica_geller You have dinosaur checks?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
monica_geller Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
phoebe_buffay Hey, Mon, what is this?
monica_geller Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
