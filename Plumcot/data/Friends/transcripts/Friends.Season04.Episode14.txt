phoebe_buffay So now, what is this now?
joey_tribbiani Guggly worm.
phoebe_buffay And this?
joey_tribbiani Glow-pop giggly jammer.
phoebe_buffay You make it so funny.
monica_geller Hey umm, what's this?
joey_tribbiani Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
joey_tribbiani That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
all@ Great!
chandler_bing You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
monica_geller Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
joey_tribbiani Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
monica_geller What's Phase Two?
joey_tribbiani Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
rachel_green How does going to a strip club help him better?
dr_ross_geller Because there are naked ladies there.
joey_tribbiani Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
dr_ross_geller There are naked ladies there too.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Would you give me one minute!! Please.
joshua_burgin So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
rachel_green Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
joshua_burgin Oh! You know what I need?

mr_waltham I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
rachel_green What?
mr_waltham For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
rachel_green Oh. Oh, right.
mr_waltham I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
rachel_green Oh yay!
chandler_bing Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
dr_ross_geller Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey!

joey_tribbiani Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
all@ Oh! God! Wow!
monica_geller You stink!
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
dr_ross_geller He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
joey_tribbiani Hey buddy! How's it going?
joey_tribbiani Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey, Monica!
monica_geller Uh-oh, what's the matter?
rachel_green Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
monica_geller I don't know sweetie.
rachel_green No! Help me!
monica_geller I can't! I have to work!
rachel_green Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
rachel_green Ugh!
phoebe_buffay Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
rachel_green Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
monica_geller No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
rachel_green Ohh! Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green So....
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green Ohhhh, come on!!!
monica_geller I think she's here.
rachel_green No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
dr_ross_geller You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
monica_geller Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode14 Hello!
rachel_green I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
dr_ross_geller All right, I'll do it.
rachel_green Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
emily_waltham Yes.
rachel_green I'm Rachel Green.
emily_waltham Thank goodness.
rachel_green There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So
emily_waltham Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
rachel_green Oh well, no I
emily_waltham Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
monica_geller I-I-I think you look great.
emily_waltham Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
rachel_green I'll get her.
dr_ross_geller Please hurry.
phoebe_buffay Don't you just love the way they talk?!
phoebe_buffay Ohh!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
monica_geller Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
joey_tribbiani Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
monica_geller Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
rachel_green Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
monica_geller So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
rachel_green Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Why?
rachel_green The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
phoebe_buffay Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
rachel_green No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
monica_geller So you hit her in the face?
rachel_green No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
phoebe_buffay Aww, Pheebs.
rachel_green Honey, that's you're name.
phoebe_buffay That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
monica_geller Hey! You're wearing pants!
chandler_bing That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
monica_geller It's 9:30 in the morning!
chandler_bing They got a breakfast buffet.
monica_geller Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
chandler_bing Ooh, let me talk to him!
monica_geller Oh-oh, my God!
chandler_bing Well, can I just
monica_geller Shh!! Wait, what?
chandler_bing She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
phoebe_buffay Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
monica_geller He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
phoebe_buffay What? Oh my God!
rachel_green What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
rachel_green They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
chandler_bing Ow!
rachel_green How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
chandler_bing Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
dr_ross_geller When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
emily_waltham Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
dr_ross_geller I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
monica_geller He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
rachel_green I don't get this! She was horrible!
chandler_bing Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
monica_geller Why do you care so much anyway?
rachel_green I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
monica_geller Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
rachel_green Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
chandler_bing So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
monica_geller A couple of days.
chandler_bing Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
monica_geller What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
chandler_bing Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
phoebe_buffay Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
monica_geller Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
chandler_bing No you can't.
phoebe_buffay Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
chandler_bing You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
phoebe_buffay Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
the_ad Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
joey_tribbiani Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
the_ad Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
joey_tribbiani Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
the_ad You.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
the_ad You?
joey_tribbiani No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
the_ad What?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
the_ad There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
joey_tribbiani Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
the_ad The one with "Heston" on it.
joey_tribbiani Interesting.
monica_geller Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
chandler_bing No thanks, Mom!
phoebe_buffay Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
the_cigarette_guy Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
phoebe_buffay Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
monica_geller Very good, so good.
phoebe_buffay I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
rachel_green Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
phoebe_buffay Come on! Look where you are!!
monica_geller When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
phoebe_buffay Remember, a virgin for me please.
monica_geller Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
chandler_bing Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
phoebe_buffay Well, if you think it will help.
chandler_bing No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
phoebe_buffay You should! How is she?
chandler_bing Ohhh!!
monica_geller I think somebody needs another lap dance.
charlton_heston Hello! Who's in there?
joey_tribbiani How ya doin'?
charlton_heston Who in the hell are you?
joey_tribbiani I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
charlton_heston Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
charlton_heston You're in this picture?
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
charlton_heston Joey, right?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
charlton_heston Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no, you don't understand
charlton_heston Listen to me!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, yeah.
charlton_heston I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
joey_tribbiani Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
charlton_heston Wait a minute! Take your pants.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Oh, yeah.
monica_geller So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
rachel_green I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
phoebe_buffay Who, Josh?
rachel_green It's Joshua.
monica_geller What, he doesn't like Josh?
rachel_green No, I don't.
chandler_bing All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
phoebe_buffay Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
chandler_bing Yeah?
phoebe_buffay And do you know what girls are really good at?
chandler_bing Stripping!
phoebe_buffay No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
rachel_green Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
monica_geller Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
chandler_bing Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
monica_geller Come on! Chandler!
chandler_bing Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
monica_geller They really were pretty, weren't they?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
monica_geller Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
rachel_green See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
monica_geller Oh, Chantal!
rachel_green Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh
chandler_bing Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
monica_geller Really?!
chandler_bing I am totally picturing you with all those women!
monica_geller That's-that's not Phase Three.
chandler_bing Well, I'm there too!
rachel_green Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
chandler_bing Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
phoebe_buffay Oh! What is that? What is that?
chandler_bing Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
chandler_bing Come on, let me see that smile.
joey_tribbiani I don't wanna.
chandler_bing Please?
joey_tribbiani I wanted to go to the strip club!
chandler_bing I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, all right.
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
dr_ross_geller Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
rachel_green Oh, hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey! You were so right!
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
rachel_green Oh, hmm.
dr_ross_geller I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy
rachel_green Joshua.
dr_ross_geller Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
rachel_green Yeah, I
dr_ross_geller But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
rachel_green Oh, thank goodness!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.

dr_ross_geller Happy for you.
rachel_green No, happy for you!
chandler_bing All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
phoebe_buffay I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
chandler_bing Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
monica_geller Wait, now, what am I doing again?
chandler_bing Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
the_cigarette_guy Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
rachel_green No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
chandler_bing What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
