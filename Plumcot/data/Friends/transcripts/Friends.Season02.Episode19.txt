phoebe_buffay Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
rachel_green Men just take out wind?
phoebe_buffay Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
rachel_green Wow.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like
monica_geller It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
phoebe_buffay Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
monica_geller No.
phoebe_buffay No, 'cause he's yummy.
monica_geller Yes. But all the other ones.
phoebe_buffay Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
joey_tribbiani Anybody want a croan.
phoebe_buffay Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
estelle_leonard Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
joey_tribbiani So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
estelle_leonard Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
joey_tribbiani No, can we get back to me?
estelle_leonard Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for
joey_tribbiani Alright. Cab driver number two?
estelle_leonard You're welcome.
joey_tribbiani But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
estelle_leonard Things change, roll with em.
joey_tribbiani But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
estelle_leonard Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry. See ya.
rachel_green Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
monica_geller Isn't it.
rachel_green Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
phoebe_buffay I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
dr_ross_geller Hey you guys.
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
rachel_green NO!
dr_ross_geller No?
rachel_green No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
dr_ross_geller Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
rachel_green No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
monica_geller You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
dr_ross_geller Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
rachel_green Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
dr_ross_geller You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
rachel_green Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay Um-um, um-um.
rachel_green You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
joey_tribbiani What is it?
dr_ross_geller I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
joey_tribbiani See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller What, what's that?
joey_tribbiani It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
dr_ross_geller Open it, open in.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller Woah.
joey_tribbiani Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
dr_ross_geller Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
joey_tribbiani Ahh.
dr_ross_geller What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
joey_tribbiani My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
dr_ross_geller Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller That audition.
joey_tribbiani That's a two line part.
dr_ross_geller Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
joey_tribbiani So what.
dr_ross_geller So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
joey_tribbiani Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
dr_ross_geller Toilet paper?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
joey_tribbiani Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
dr_ross_geller I am your friend.
joey_tribbiani Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
dr_ross_geller But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
dr_ross_geller Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
joey_tribbiani Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
dr_ross_geller Huh, I'm just saying...
joey_tribbiani Well don't just say.
dr_ross_geller Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
joey_tribbiani Ok.
dr_ross_geller Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
joey_tribbiani I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
eddie_menuek Hey pal.
chandler_bing Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?

chandler_bing Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
eddie_menuek Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
chandler_bing Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
eddie_menuek Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
chandler_bing Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
eddie_menuek Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
chandler_bing Your last roommate's kidney?
eddie_menuek That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
joey_tribbiani Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.

casting_director Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
joey_tribbiani What?
casting_director Five oh dollars.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on
casting_director That's great.
joey_tribbiani And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
casting_director Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
joey_tribbiani No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish.
phoebe_buffay Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.

rachel_green Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
phoebe_buffay Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
rachel_green Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
monica_geller One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, what's goin' on?

dr_ross_geller No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
joey_tribbiani Thanks Ross.
