janice Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
phoebe_buffay Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
janice Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
joey_tribbiani Well, that's really a different question.
janice I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
joey_tribbiani Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
monica_geller@rachel_green What?!!
rachel_green Excuse me, there was no time!
joey_tribbiani Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
janice Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
rachel_green Does anybody need more coffee?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'll take some.
joey_tribbiani Hey, there's a dog out there!
phoebe_buffay Oh, that is so unfortunate.
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
monica_geller Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
phoebe_buffay You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
monica_geller Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
phoebe_buffay Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
phoebe_buffay I think on some levels she already knows.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
chandler_bing I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
phoebe_buffay Why, nobody good?
chandler_bing Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
dr_ross_geller So how many more do you have tomorrow?
chandler_bing Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
monica_geller Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
dr_ross_geller Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
chandler_bing Umm, how's it going with you guys?
dr_ross_geller Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
phoebe_buffay Oh, really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
chandler_bing Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
eric Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
chandler_bing Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
eric Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
chandler_bing Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.

chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Thank you soo, much.
chandler_bing Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
monica_geller You want some help with that?
joey_tribbiani Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
monica_geller Whoa! Are you okay?
joey_tribbiani Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
monica_geller It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
joey_tribbiani That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
monica_geller Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
joey_tribbiani Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
monica_geller Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
joey_tribbiani Gotcha.
monica_geller This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
joey_tribbiani Oh, you bet I am!
monica_geller Okay, here's your penis!
monica_geller Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
joey_tribbiani You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
monica_geller So?!
joey_tribbiani Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
monica_geller Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
joey_tribbiani Oh right, right.
monica_geller I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
joey_tribbiani Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
monica_geller It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
monica_geller Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Huh?
monica_geller Where's your bed?
phoebe_buffay It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
monica_geller What are you talking about?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
monica_geller Everybody knows!
phoebe_buffay That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
monica_geller Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
monica_geller What?!?!
phoebe_buffay Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
monica_geller You can spill. In the sink.
phoebe_buffay Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
monica_geller I love you, too.
phoebe_buffay Aww, good. What?
monica_geller What? I'm just said.
phoebe_buffay No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
chandler_bing So ah, whatcha watching?
joey_tribbiani Baywatch.
chandler_bing What's it about?
joey_tribbiani Lifeguards.
chandler_bing Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
joey_tribbiani Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
chandler_bing Wow! Look at them run.
joey_tribbiani They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'll go get one.
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
chandler_bing Well, hello!
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
monica_geller Help yourself.
chandler_bing You okay?
monica_geller Phoebe moved out.
chandler_bing Right.
monica_geller I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
chandler_bing Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
monica_geller Well, I think so.
chandler_bing Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
dr_ross_geller Hi. Where is everybody?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
dr_ross_geller My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
phoebe_buffay Oh no! Why?
dr_ross_geller 'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
dr_ross_geller I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
phoebe_buffay Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
dr_ross_geller Well, now I do!!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
phoebe_buffay Aw, God Ross. Oh.
chandler_bing Umm, this is nice.
monica_geller I know, it is isn't it?
chandler_bing No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
monica_geller Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
chandler_bing Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
monica_geller Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
monica_geller I know. Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
phoebe_buffay I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
phoebe_buffay And you're so sweet. And you're kind
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

dr_ross_geller My foot is stuck in the pocket.
phoebe_buffay What?
dr_ross_geller No, I can't get it out.
phoebe_buffay Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
dr_ross_geller No, come on don't start. Ouch!
phoebe_buffay What?
dr_ross_geller Stupid balls are in the way.
dr_ross_geller Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
phoebe_buffay You have chalk on your face.
dr_ross_geller Huh?
phoebe_buffay Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
monica_geller Hey, are you okay?
