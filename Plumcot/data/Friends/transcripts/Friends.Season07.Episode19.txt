phoebe_buffay Oh hey! How was your audition?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, do I know you?
phoebe_buffay What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
phoebe_buffay Oh! You got it?!
joey_tribbiani Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
monica_geller What was it for?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
phoebe_buffay The next, next?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
estelle_leonard Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
joey_tribbiani They loved me!
estelle_leonard Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
estelle_leonard There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
phoebe_buffay What's the matter?
joey_tribbiani They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
monica_geller Wow!
joey_tribbiani I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
phoebe_buffay Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
phoebe_buffay Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
monica_geller Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
dr_ross_geller A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
monica_geller Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
phoebe_buffay Sure.
monica_geller I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
dr_ross_geller Cassie?
monica_geller Uh-hmm.
dr_ross_geller Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
monica_geller Ross, she's 25 years old.
dr_ross_geller So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
monica_geller Subtle guys!
phoebe_buffay What?!
monica_geller I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
rachel_green Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
monica_geller Okay. Sorry.
rachel_green Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
monica_geller Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
joey_tribbiani I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
monica_geller That's what you say about porn.
joey_tribbiani You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
monica_geller No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
joey_tribbiani Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
monica_geller Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
phoebe_buffay Well when can we have this shower?
rachel_green She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday
phoebe_buffay Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
rachel_green Yesterday!
phoebe_buffay Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
rachel_green Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
phoebe_buffay Rachel, calm down!
rachel_green Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
phoebe_buffay Just calm down woman!
rachel_green Phoebe, I already, I already did.
phoebe_buffay Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
rachel_green Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
phoebe_buffay Uh, here. What time?
rachel_green 4 o'clock. Food?
phoebe_buffay Finger sandwiches and tea.
rachel_green Ooh great! Very Monica.
phoebe_buffay And chili!
rachel_green Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
phoebe_buffay Both!
rachel_green We're paying for this y'know.
phoebe_buffay Neither.
rachel_green Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
phoebe_buffay Lusts of the flesh.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. A cowboy theme?
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
monica_geller Oh boy me too!
chandler_bing Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
monica_geller Yeah?
chandler_bing Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
monica_geller The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
chandler_bing That's me! Come on!
monica_geller Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
chandler_bing Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
monica_geller Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
cassie_geller I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
chandler_bing Hi! Nice to meet you!
cassie_geller Nice to meet you too.
monica_geller So, are you ready to go?
cassie_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing I'll be right with you.
monica_geller Cassie needs to stay at your place.
dr_ross_geller What-why?
monica_geller Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
dr_ross_geller What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
chandler_bing I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
monica_geller You were staring about eight inches south of there.
dr_ross_geller Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
monica_geller She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
chandler_bing Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
monica_geller Wafer thin ice!
joey_tribbiani Hey, I'm back!
the_casting_director Hi-hi Joey.
joey_tribbiani Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
the_casting_director Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
joey_tribbiani Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
the_casting_director Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
joey_tribbiani And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
the_casting_director Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Wow! Sure! That's great!
the_casting_director Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
the_casting_director Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So
joey_tribbiani So...What?
the_casting_director So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
joey_tribbiani Yes!
the_casting_director Okay.
joey_tribbiani No. What?
the_casting_director An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be
joey_tribbiani Barmifsaed?
monica_geller So to get this part you can't be?
joey_tribbiani Nope.
monica_geller But you are?
joey_tribbiani Yep.
monica_geller But you told them you weren't?
joey_tribbiani That's right.
monica_geller Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
joey_tribbiani I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
monica_geller Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
joey_tribbiani I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
monica_geller Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
joey_tribbiani I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
monica_geller Unless!
joey_tribbiani Unless what?
monica_geller Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
joey_tribbiani Like what?
monica_geller Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
phoebe_buffay Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
rachel_green Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey! What's up Mon?
monica_geller Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
rachel_green Have at it.
monica_geller Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
rachel_green Are you makin' him a sandwich?
monica_geller No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
rachel_green We have to get her a present?!
phoebe_buffay Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
rachel_green Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
dr_ross_geller Cassie?!
cassie_geller Hey Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
cassie_geller It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
cassie_geller Ah yeah, sorry about that.
dr_ross_geller It's okay. Come, come on in.
cassie_geller Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
cassie_geller Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
cassie_geller Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
dr_ross_geller Yeah-No!!
dr_ross_geller Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
cassie_geller I'm all done.
dr_ross_geller Thank God.
cassie_geller I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
dr_ross_geller Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
cassie_geller I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
cassie_geller It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
dr_ross_geller Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 Hi!
phoebe_buffay How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 Oh thank you.
phoebe_buffay Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 No.
the_other_woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 No thanks.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Hey Rach?
rachel_green Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Who the hell are all these people?
rachel_green Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
phoebe_buffay Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
rachel_green Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 I was her accountant four years ago.
rachel_green Ohhhh!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
rachel_green That's great!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode19 So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green I don't know.
rachel_green Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
phoebe_buffay You were supposed to tell her!
rachel_green No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
phoebe_buffay Fine, I'll go call her.
rachel_green Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
monica_geller Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
joey_tribbiani Wow! This looks great!
monica_geller Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
joey_tribbiani And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
monica_geller Oh, just until the glue dries.
joey_tribbiani Thank God!
monica_geller Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
joey_tribbiani Ah.
monica_geller Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
joey_tribbiani Well maybe we just take that one away.
monica_geller I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
joey_tribbiani Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
joey_tribbiani Ow!
monica_geller Toothpick?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
monica_geller What are you trying on now?
joey_tribbiani The fruit roll up.
monica_geller And?
joey_tribbiani Delicious.
monica_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
monica_geller What?! Which one?!
joey_tribbiani The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
dr_ross_geller She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
cassie_geller Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
dr_ross_geller Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
monica_geller Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
rachel_green Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
monica_geller For what?
rachel_green Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
phoebe_buffay And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
monica_geller You al-you already had it?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
rachel_green Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
phoebe_buffay We ruined everything.
rachel_green Ugh
monica_geller Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
rachel_green What do you, what do you mean?
monica_geller Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
rachel_green Surprise
phoebe_buffay Sur-surprise.
rachel_green ...Monica.
joey_tribbiani And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
the_director Yeah.
joey_tribbiani My whole family's from Naples!
the_director Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie
the_casting_director Joey, this is awkward part.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
phoebe_buffay Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
cassie_geller Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
phoebe_buffay Oh! No problem! I
cassie_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
