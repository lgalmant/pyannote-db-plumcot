rachel Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
joey Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
all Who?
joey All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
all Wow!
joey Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
chandler 'Cause he was just so darn cute.
joey No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
ross Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
joey I did do it, I'm a professional.
monica Then what's the problem?
joey See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
phoebe Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
chandler Hey, what did your agent say?
joey Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
monica What, forget it!
rachel Yeah, right.
joey Come on, I need your help here.
phoebe All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
joey You see this, this is a friend.
phoebe Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
joey Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
monica Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
joey Yeah, that makes sense.
ross Over my dead body!
chandler And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
ross Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
phoebe Oh my God, you look so good!
rachel I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
