joey_tribbiani Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
joey_tribbiani What are you doing?
rachel_green Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
joey_tribbiani Why would you want to do that?
rachel_green So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
joey_tribbiani Rach, there is a decent place to
rachel_green And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
joey_tribbiani No. No. No.
rachel_green No?
joey_tribbiani No. Rosita does not move.
rachel_green I'm sorry, Rosita? As in
joey_tribbiani As in Rosita does not move.
rachel_green Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
joey_tribbiani The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
rachel_green Stevie the TV?
joey_tribbiani Is there a problem?
rachel_green No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
chandler_bing Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
dr_ross_geller Sure, do whatever you want.
monica_geller Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
monica_geller Look at this.
dr_ross_geller Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
phoebe_buffay What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
monica_geller I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
phoebe_buffay I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
dr_ross_geller Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
chandler_bing Sorry!
rachel_green Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
joey_tribbiani I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
rachel_green Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
joey_tribbiani She's not even cold yet!
rachel_green But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
joey_tribbiani That's true.
rachel_green Okay? You ready?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
monica_geller Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
dr_ross_geller They kept your room for a while.
monica_geller Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
dr_ross_geller Come on, you know they love you.
monica_geller As much as they love you?
dr_ross_geller I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Ugh, I hate this year!
dr_ross_geller What's wrong with this year?
phoebe_buffay Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
monica_geller That was me and Ross.
phoebe_buffay Oh that's right!
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
monica_geller Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
phoebe_buffay Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, like you never called!
the_supervisor So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
the_supervisor Why don't we do a trial run.
phoebe_buffay Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
the_supervisor I'm the supply manager.
phoebe_buffay Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
the_supervisor We don't need any toner.
phoebe_buffay Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
the_supervisor Okay, what was wrong with that call?
phoebe_buffay Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
the_supervisor They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
the_supervisor So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
phoebe_buffay No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
chandler_bing Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
dr_ross_geller Dad?
jack_geller I'm here!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
jack_geller Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
dr_ross_geller Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
jack_geller Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
dr_ross_geller Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
jack_geller I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
monica_geller Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories
jack_geller Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
monica_geller I used to love to play restaurant.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
monica_geller Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
jack_geller So, I think you're boxes are over here.
dr_ross_geller Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
jack_geller I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
dr_ross_geller Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
jack_geller Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
dr_ross_geller It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
jack_geller Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller What?
jack_geller Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
dr_ross_geller How are you ever going to sell this place?
jack_geller I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
dr_ross_geller Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
jack_geller You don't secretly smoke do you?
dr_ross_geller No!
jack_geller So it's just your mother then.
phoebe_buffay Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
earl I don't need any toner.
phoebe_buffay I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
earl Not me.
phoebe_buffay May I ask why?
earl You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
phoebe_buffay I surely do!
earl Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
phoebe_buffay Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
earl Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
phoebe_buffay No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
earl Well...I only have one thing to do today. I guess I could push it back.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
earl It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
phoebe_buffay Chandler?
earl I-I'm sorry?
phoebe_buffay No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
earl Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
chandler_bing My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
rachel_green You will like it!
joey_tribbiani No I won't.
rachel_green You don't even know!
joey_tribbiani Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
rachel_green Well look, if you don't like this
joey_tribbiani I don't know why you say that so soon.
rachel_green Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
joey_tribbiani Francette? What is she? A couch?
joey_tribbiani Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
rachel_green Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
joey_tribbiani Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
rachel_green That's weird.
joey_tribbiani No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
rachel_green It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
joey_tribbiani Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
rachel_green Joey, I really don't
joey_tribbiani Can you tell me how this happened?
rachel_green Well no.
joey_tribbiani Miracle!
rachel_green No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
joey_tribbiani Someone like an...angel?
rachel_green That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
joey_tribbiani Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
jack_geller Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
dr_ross_geller Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
jack_geller Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
dr_ross_geller Well, can you blame her?
jack_geller Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could
dr_ross_geller Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
jack_geller Really?
dr_ross_geller Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
jack_geller Great!
dr_ross_geller Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
jack_geller Sure!
dr_ross_geller Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
jack_geller This could've been hers!
dr_ross_geller Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
jack_geller Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
rachel_green I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, me too.
rachel_green Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
joey_tribbiani Fine.
rachel_green Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
joey_tribbiani No. Really?
rachel_green Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
joey_tribbiani My chair heels itself.
phoebe_buffay Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
the_guy Hey guy!
phoebe_buffay Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
earl No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
phoebe_buffay All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
earl Yeah! Right!
phoebe_buffay Oh sorry, boyfriend!
earl Oh no.
phoebe_buffay No, whatever! Anything!
the_guy Hey guy!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, he's gotta go.
earl Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
phoebe_buffay No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
the_supervisor The new girl's good.
monica_geller Hey guys! Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
jack_geller That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
monica_geller Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
dr_ross_geller Well, these. These are yours right here.
monica_geller Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
monica_geller Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
dr_ross_geller Nu-uh!
monica_geller Oh, an old glove?
jack_geller Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
monica_geller Wow! Look at this! I can't believe I even fit into this shirt! Oh, this is yours.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
monica_geller This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
dr_ross_geller Umm, your boxes are umm
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller Dad?
jack_geller Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
monica_geller Just mine?
jack_geller I'm afraid so.
monica_geller So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
jack_geller Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
monica_geller So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
jack_geller There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
monica_geller I can't believe this!
jack_geller Screw it! I'm having one.
rachel_green Hey Chandler!
chandler_bing Hey!
rachel_green How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
rachel_green Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
chandler_bing Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
rachel_green I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
chandler_bing That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
rachel_green Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair
chandler_bing Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
rachel_green Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
chandler_bing Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
rachel_green Noo! Angels.
chandler_bing I'm gettin' my chair back!
rachel_green What? Wh-hey!
joey_tribbiani Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
chandler_bing Joey you broke my chair!!
joey_tribbiani Your chair?!
rachel_green Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
joey_tribbiani So, there was no miracle?!
rachel_green No Joe, no miracle.
joey_tribbiani Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
rachel_green Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
chandler_bing I think I should get the chair!
joey_tribbiani How do you figure?
chandler_bing Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
rachel_green No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
chandler_bing Well, where's the logic in that?!
rachel_green The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
chandler_bing So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
joey_tribbiani That's right!
chandler_bing What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! We are!
rachel_green We're the Cobras!
phoebe_buffay Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
marge Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
earl I'm right here!!!!
phoebe_buffay Earl! I'm Phoebe.
earl Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
phoebe_buffay Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
earl Look, um I really appreciate your coming down
phoebe_buffay No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
earl Why?!
phoebe_buffay Because it was fate that made me call you today!
earl I thought it was toner.
phoebe_buffay No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
earl Really?!
phoebe_buffay Yes.
earl How?
phoebe_buffay I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
earl Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
phoebe_buffay No, it's fate!
earl It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
earl I'm actually the office manager.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
earl Well, was there anything else?!
phoebe_buffay Sure! Umm, where are you from?
earl Philadelphia.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
earl Really?
phoebe_buffay Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
earl Yeah-yeah.
phoebe_buffay But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
earl Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
phoebe_buffay Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
earl Yeah.
monica_geller Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
dr_ross_geller All right. I think it was a mouse.
jack_geller How are you honey?
monica_geller How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
jack_geller Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
monica_geller What's this?
jack_geller It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
monica_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller What?!!!
jack_geller I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
monica_geller Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
dr_ross_geller Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
jack_geller Why don't we take it for a spin?
monica_geller All right!
dr_ross_geller Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah.
rachel_green Ahhhh....
joey_tribbiani Ahhh...... Eh?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
monica_geller Hey guys!
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
rachel_green Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
monica_geller Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
