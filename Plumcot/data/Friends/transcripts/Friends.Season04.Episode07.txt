chandler_bing I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
dr_ross_geller Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
chandler_bing It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
phoebe_buffay Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
all@ Yeah! Oh my God!
casey#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode07 Here you go.
joey_tribbiani Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
casey#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode07 Great!
chandler_bing Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
joey_tribbiani That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
chandler_bing Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
joey_tribbiani No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
chandler_bing Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
chandler_bing Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
joey_tribbiani What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
chandler_bing Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
joey_tribbiani You got all that from the back of her head?
chandler_bing All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
joey_tribbiani Who's Elaine?
phoebe_buffay "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
dr_ross_geller Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
monica_geller Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
phoebe_buffay I wanna hear "The Sound."
dr_ross_geller Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
phoebe_buffay Come on, play that funky music white boy.
monica_geller Yeah!
dr_ross_geller No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay, guys.
chandler_bing All right! Bring it on, you
dr_ross_geller Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm
chandler_bing Oh my God! Play!
monica_geller Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
chandler_bing Really, bitchin'!
phoebe_buffay Wow, it was so-wow!
dr_ross_geller Really?! I mean, really?!!
rachel_green Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
dr_ross_geller Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so
monica_geller Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
rachel_green Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
phoebe_buffay What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
chandler_bing You mean like, music?
chandler_bing Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
chandler_bing Come in!
kathy Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
chandler_bing Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
kathy So is Joey around?
chandler_bing No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
kathy I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
chandler_bing I like it in the stern...of the boat. Hello.
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
chandler_bing What happened?
joey_tribbiani We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
chandler_bing Why can't you tell her?
joey_tribbiani 'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
chandler_bing Joey! Joey!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
chandler_bing I thought your time ran out.
joey_tribbiani Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
chandler_bing Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
kathy Oh.
chandler_bing So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
kathy Oh, okay.
chandler_bing Yeah, I think it is!
kathy So what did you do today?
chandler_bing Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
kathy Oh, it looks great!
chandler_bing ...and then it got canceled.
kathy Well, I could cut it.
chandler_bing Really?! You do that?
kathy Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
chandler_bing Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
kathy You have really great hair.
chandler_bing Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
kathy Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
chandler_bing What-what 'cha doin'?
kathy Checking to see if it's even.
chandler_bing 'Kay.
kathy Looks good.
chandler_bing Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
joey_tribbiani Hey dude, it's me.
chandler_bing Hey it's Joey!
joey_tribbiani Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
chandler_bing Oh yeah man. Joey.
kathy Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
chandler_bing Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
kathy I forgot my purse.
chandler_bing Oh.
kathy No, I really did forget my purse.
chandler_bing No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
kathy Horrible!
chandler_bing Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
kathy No-no-no, the kiss was good.
chandler_bing Okay!
kathy No, but that's bad!
chandler_bing Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
kathy What?!
chandler_bing Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
kathy Can you really do that?
chandler_bing I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
kathy Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you
chandler_bing Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
kathy I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
chandler_bing I-I think we have too.
kathy Okay. Bye.
chandler_bing Bye. Are you still out there?
kathy No.
dr_ross_geller Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time
monica_geller Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
phoebe_buffay It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
dr_ross_geller Thank you guys-guys-guys
monica_geller Hey, aren't you up next?
phoebe_buffay Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
rachel_green Why not?
phoebe_buffay I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
monica_geller Phoebe, Ross sucks!
rachel_green Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
monica_geller Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
rachel_green Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
phoebe_buffay You guys. You suck too.
joey_tribbiani Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
chandler_bing Hang on buddy!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
chandler_bing I sure did.
joey_tribbiani Why?
chandler_bing Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
joey_tribbiani Well, you're amazing.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
joey_tribbiani A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
chandler_bing Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
chandler_bing Oh, I don't know.
joey_tribbiani Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
chandler_bing You mean with Casey.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
chandler_bing Or Casey.
joey_tribbiani No-no, Kathy.
chandler_bing Could be Casey.
joey_tribbiani No. No, Kathy.
chandler_bing Consider Casey.
joey_tribbiani Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
chandler_bing That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
dr_ross_geller Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
phoebe_buffay Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I
dr_ross_geller See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore.
phoebe_buffay Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, okay.
dr_ross_geller Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
monica_geller Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
chandler_bing I kissed Kathy.
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller Are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Does Joey know?
chandler_bing No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
monica_geller You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
dr_ross_geller No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
chandler_bing Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
phoebe_buffay I think maybe, yeah.
monica_geller He loves you.
chandler_bing Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
dr_ross_geller Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
rachel_green I know, I remember that!
monica_geller I remember you did.
chandler_bing God!! What am I gonna do?!
rachel_green Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
chandler_bing Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
rachel_green Because you do.
chandler_bing Yeah, I know.
dr_ross_geller Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
chandler_bing Is that a real thing?
joey_tribbiani Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
chandler_bing Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
joey_tribbiani What's up?
chandler_bing It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
joey_tribbiani You do?
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, she broke up with me.
chandler_bing Oh uh, when?
joey_tribbiani Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
chandler_bing Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
joey_tribbiani Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
chandler_bing Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
chandler_bing Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
chandler_bing Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
joey_tribbiani But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So
chandler_bing See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
joey_tribbiani Who?
chandler_bing It's me. I'm the other guy.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
joey_tribbiani And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
chandler_bing No! No! No! I just kissed her.
joey_tribbiani What?!! That's even worse!!
chandler_bing How is that worse?!
joey_tribbiani I don't know! But it's the same!
chandler_bing Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
joey_tribbiani Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
chandler_bing You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
joey_tribbiani Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
chandler_bing Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
joey_tribbiani Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
chandler_bing Probably because
joey_tribbiani Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
dr_ross_geller Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
phoebe_buffay After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, like I could lose it.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller I played bad on purpose guys.
monica_geller Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
dr_ross_geller Yeah-no, just that last song.
