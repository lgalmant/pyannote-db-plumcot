ross Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
phoebe I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
ross Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
monica That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
ross Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
chandler That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
ross What?
chandler I made that joke up.
ross Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
chandler Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
ross Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
ross What?
rachel I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
chandler Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
monica No.
chandler Seriously?
monica Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
ross Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
chandler Yeah, I guess.
joey Hey guys.
chandler Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
ross No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
chandler It's my joke.
ross It's my joke.
joey Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
chandler Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
joey Let's go watch it at your place.
chandler Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
joey Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
chandler What? No, I want to watch this. Did your cable go out?
joey No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know
chandler Joey, why is your cable out?
joey I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
chandler If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
joey No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
chandler Whoa ho.
joey I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book
chandler All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
joey Sure.
chandler Paid your phone bill?
joey Not so much.
phoebe Hey.
monica It's only you.
phoebe Wh-wh-what are you doing?
rachel We are looking at a Playboy.
phoebe Oh, I want to look too! Yikes!
monica So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
rachel Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
monica Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
phoebe Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
rachel_and_monica Yeah.
rachel You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
monica Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
rachel I don't know.
monica Me neither.
phoebe Rachel.
monica What?!
phoebe I don't know. Me neither.
joey You forget how many great songs Heart had.
chandler Yeah.
ross You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
chandler So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
joey Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
ross What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
chandler And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
chandler You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
ross Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
chandler So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
ross Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
chandler Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
ross Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
chandler Yeah!
ross Well, I'm not going to go now anyway
chandler Okay
gunther Here you go.
joey Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
gunther Well, if you want, you can work here.
joey Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
gunther Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
joey What?!
gunther Flexible hours.
joey Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
monica She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
chandler He took my joke, he took it.
monica It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
chandler You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
monica That's a good idea.
chandler Yeah!
monica Do you know what's a bad idea?
chandler Picking Rachel.
monica That's right. Did you hear something?
chandler Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
monica It's coming from the living room.
joey I finished my book.
monica Hey, you guys.
phoebe_and_rachel Hey.
monica Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
rachel Monica, what are you doing?
monica Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
phoebe I guess it was kinda funny.
monica It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
phoebe Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're.. just.. kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
monica That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
phoebe No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
rachel Well, people are different.
phoebe Ya, you know, Rachel.. she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
rachel What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
phoebe Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
rachel Oh my.. you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
monica You start working on that list.
rachel I cannot believe her.
monica I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
rachel Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
monica I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
rachel All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
monica All right.
ross Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
gunther Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
joey Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
ross Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
joey Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
rachel No.
monica No, thank you.
joey You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
woman I'd love an ice water.
joey You got it.
monica Joey, what are you doing?
joey Just being friendly.
rachel Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
joey Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
gunther Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
joey Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
monica Joey, do you work here?
joey No.
customer Hey, waiter.
joey Yeah?
monica Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
joey It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
chandler So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
joey I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
rachel Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
ross Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
joey Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
ross Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
joey See, now it's weird again.
chandler I think it's great that you work here. You're going to make a lot of money, and here's your first tip: Don't eat yellow snow. Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
rachel Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
joey Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
ross Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
joey Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
rachel Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
phoebe Okay.
monica So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
rachel Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
monica Hah!
phoebe That true, I am flaky.
rachel So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
phoebe Yeah, totally.
monica Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
rachel Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
phoebe That's great. Good for you guys.
monica I am not high maintenance!
rachel I am not a pushover!
phoebe Who said you were?
monica_and_rachel You did!
phoebe Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
joey Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
gunther No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
joey Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
gunther That's the whole part?
joey Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but
gunther Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
joey Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
patron Oh, excuse me.
joey No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
patron I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
joey So, you'd hire me, right?
patron For what?
joey Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
customers Huh? What?
joey Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
ross It's my joke.
chandler It's my joke.
ross_and_chandler It's my joke.
ross Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
chandler Let's have Monica decide.
ross Yeah!
chandler Yeah!
ross Hey Mon.
chandler Mon, get out here!
ross Monica!
chandler Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
monica Why do I have to decide?
chandler Because you're the only one that can be fair.
ross Yeah.
monica I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
ross Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
chandler Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
ross We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
monica Okay, Chandler, you go first.
chandler Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
monica Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
chandler Can I finish my story?!
monica Do you want me to pick you?!
ross See, I would never snap at you like that.
monica Continue.
chandler So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
ross Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
chandler I'm not arguing with that.
monica All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
monica You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
ross It's your joke.
chandler Is not.
monica Hi, Chandler. There you are.
chandler Hi, oh hi.
monica Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
chandler Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
rachel Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
phoebe Really? I've heard better.
monica Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
chandler I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
monica Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
chandler You're a little high maintenance.
monica Ahhh! You are on my list.
chandler I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like.. maintaining you.
monica I didn't even tell him to say that. All right you're off my list.
chandler I'm off the list.
monica Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
phoebe Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
chandler Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
joey Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so
phoebe Wow! That is a bad audition.
rachel How-how did you lose your job here?
joey Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
rachel He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
joey Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
rachel Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him
gunther Okay.
rachel What?
gunther He can have his job back.
rachel That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
joey That's great. Thanks Rach.
rachel Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
phoebe Rach, you're in my seat.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry.
phoebe Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
monica I pick you, Phoebe.
rachel Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
phoebe Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
chandler Hey.
rachel Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
ross No way.
joey I'm not answering that.
chandler Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
