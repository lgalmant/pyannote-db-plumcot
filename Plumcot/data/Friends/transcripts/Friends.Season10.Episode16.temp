joey All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
rachel Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
joey Just flip!
rachel Ha, tails!
joey Damnit!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey!
chandler So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
rachel Oh, that sounds good!
monica Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
rachel It's all done!
monica Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
rachel I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
monica Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
rachel Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
monica Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
chandler Where's your passport?
rachel It should be right next to my plane ticket.
chandler Well, it's not.
rachel What? Maybe I put it in here Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
monica Here, let me help you.
rachel Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
chandler At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
monica Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
erica I know.
monica You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
erica No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
ross Hey!
erica Hi.
ross Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
erica That's because I'm pregnant!
ross Right, no, I understand.
erica Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
ross No, no, I knew
monica Okay, well, stop staring at them.
ross She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
erica Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
monica Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
ross Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
monica Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
erica Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
ross Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
monica Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
erica I'll be right back.
ross Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
monica Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
ross No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
monica Yeah, it takes two incomes.
ross Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
monica Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
ross Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
monica Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
ross What are you guys doing?
joey Try it, I can't feel a thing!
monica Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
chandler We're taking a break!
monica From?
chandler Jumping on the bed?
monica All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
ross You got it! All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
chandler No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
joey You guys hear a ringing?
chandler What the hell is this?
joey Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
ross Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
chandler I didn't know Monica had these!
joey Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
chandler Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
ross Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey! Where's Mike?
phoebe Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
ross Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
phoebe Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
ross Rock on!
phoebe Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
monica Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
ross Hey, where's Rach?
joey Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
ross Great.
joey Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
monica Yeah.
everybody Hey Rach, hey you.
ross Here she is!
rachel Hi you guys!
joey What did I just say?
rachel No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
monica Come here, I'll make you a drink.
ross Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
chandler I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
joey You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
ross Yeah?
joey Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
chandler Yes, Joe?
joey I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
phoebe You doing ok?
rachel Well, I've been better.
phoebe Uh-hmm.
rachel You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
phoebe Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
rachel I'm gonna miss you so much.
phoebe I know.
rachel You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here
ross Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
joey Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
rachel Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
phoebe Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
rachel Oh, oh. What is this?
phoebe It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
rachel I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
monica Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
chandler Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
monica What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
chandler Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
monica That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
chandler Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
monica Rachel used to live in that room.
chandler Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
monica Joey's bare ass!
chandler Well played.
rachel I love you Phoebe.
phoebe I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
rachel All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
phoebe Ok.
rachel Ok. Monica?
monica Yeah?
rachel Can you come here with me for a minute?
monica Sure.
phoebe Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
monica No.
phoebe Oh, you're so screwed.
ross Hey. What was that all about?
phoebe She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
ross Are you kidding? Oh my God...
phoebe Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
ross Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
rachel Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
monica I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
rachel I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
monica You're the best friend I ever had.
monica What?
rachel I... I... I...
monica That is so sweet.
ross Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
chandler Uh, Rach?
ross Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
joey I really made you think about that thing uh?
chandler Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
rachel Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
chandler No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
rachel Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
chandler Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
rachel Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
chandler Pheebs!
phoebe Yeah!
chandler I think these are yours.
phoebe These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
rachel Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
chandler Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
phoebe Where do you think Mike really is?
rachel Oh honey...
chandler Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
rachel Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
chandler Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
rachel Okay. Oh...
rachel Oh!
chandler I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
monica So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
ross I don't think so.
chandler Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
monica You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
chandler That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
ross God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
phoebe I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
all No, no, no, no!
ross Okay, here we go...
rachel Oh... Well...
ross Yeah...
rachel I think I'm gonna take off.
ross Huh?
rachel Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
ross What? I don't get a goodbye?
joey Lucky bastard!
ross Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
monica Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
ross Well, it needs to be plicit.
joey All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
ross No, I don't think so.
phoebe You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
monica Yeah. Mine too.
chandler Mine was a humdinger
ross O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
phoebe Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
monica And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
ross THE HELL I DO!
ross I don't get a goodbye?
rachel What?
ross Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
rachel Ross...
ross Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
monica I hope Ross isn't too upset.
joey I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
phoebe Tell me about it.
chandler Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
phoebe All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
monica Uh, where do you think you're going?
phoebe I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
monica We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
chandler Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
joey Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
monica Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
chandler You couldn't be cool.
monica Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
phoebe_and_joey Yeah.
monica Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
chandler Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
monica You did? How?
chandler Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
monica Oh my God! Let me see.
joey Who's that dirty old lady?
chandler Monica's grandmother.
monica Nana liked it rough!
erica Hi!
all Hey!
joey Come on here, have a seat.
phoebe How was your night?
erica Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
monica Erica, are you okay?
erica Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
monica Oh my God!
chandler Relax! We just get her some antacids.
monica She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
chandler Oh my God!
phoebe Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
monica All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
chandler Honey, it's gonna be okay.
erica You can do this. Just breathe.
monica Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
erica Ooh! Are you sure?
monica Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
joey Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
chandler What?
joey If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
rachel You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
ross That's what it seemed like.
rachel I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
ross Fine, then why didn't you say something?
rachel Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
ross Rach!
rachel What?
ross You keep, you keep... You can't...
rachel WHAT?
joey A little more.
phoebe Okay.
joey A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
phoebe All right, ready?
joey Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
phoebe All right, here it goes...
joey Doesn't work...
