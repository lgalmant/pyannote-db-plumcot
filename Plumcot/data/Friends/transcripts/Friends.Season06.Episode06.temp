chandler Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
joey Right! And when is that due?
chandler First of the month.
joey And that's every month?
chandler No, just the months you actually want to live here.
joey Ahhh.
chandler Okay, here is the phone bill.
joey Oh my God!!
chandler That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
joey No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
chandler It's not charity, Joe
joey No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
chandler Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
joey This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
chandler Uh, yeah.
chandler So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
phoebe So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
chandler No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
phoebe Well, how much do you think he needs?
chandler I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
phoebe Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
chandler Well that would help the pride thing.
monica Hey!
chandler Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
monica Okay.
chandler Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
monica Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
phoebe And also, my birthday.
monica It's not your birthday.
phoebe What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
joey Hey!
ross Hey!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
chandler Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
ross Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
joey I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
ross I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
rachel Pheebs, I was wondering
monica You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
rachel Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
monica Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
rachel Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
phoebe My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
phoebe Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
rachel Yeah, yeah, I know.
phoebe Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
monica Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
rachel Surprise!!
monica What?
rachel No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
monica I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
phoebe I have plans.
monica You're plans were with us.
phoebe That's right.
monica All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
phoebe Okay.
monica Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
phoebe Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
monica Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with
chandler Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
monica I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
chandler Yes, but for the last time.
monica Okay fine, now Ross
ross Oh, but-but I can't do it.
monica Why not?
joey I've got Ben.
ross Because, because I've got Ben.
monica It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
chandler He's at a dinner party.
monica Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
ross Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
monica All right, sorry.
ross I gotta go make a fake Ben.
joey Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
chandler Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
joey Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
chandler Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
joey What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
chandler Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
joey Okay, you're on.
chandler Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
rachel Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
monica Oh God!
rachel You remember when we got these?
monica No.
rachel I guess you weren't there.
phoebe You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
rachel I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
monica I'm gonna miss you so much.
phoebe Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
monica I don't think there's anything.
phoebe Come on, there's gotta be something.
monica Nope, she's perfect.
rachel I have one.
phoebe Good! Great! You can go first.
rachel Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
phoebe Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
monica Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
phoebe Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
monica Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
rachel You get your messages!
monica Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
rachel So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
phoebe Great! It worked! No one's sad.
joey Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
chandler Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
joey You serious?
chandler Oh yes!
joey Okay, get ready to owe me!
chandler Okay.
joey Okay, here we go. Ready?
chandler No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
chandler See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
monica Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
rachel Ooh, your brother. Score!
monica What's up?
ross Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
monica Oh, put him on!
ross Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
phoebe Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
rachel You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
monica "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
rachel "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
phoebe Hey! I call her!
monica "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
rachel "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
phoebe Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
chandler Still broken?
joey This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
chandler Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
joey Nah, not my game.
chandler Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
joey Well, what's it called?
chandler Cups.
joey I don't know how to play Cups.
chandler I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
joey All right.
chandler Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
joey A two and a five.
chandler Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
joey Really?!
chandler Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
joey A four and a nine.
chandler You're kidding right?
joey No. Why?
chandler Well that's a full cup!
joey Damn! I am good at Cups!
monica I'm not talking to her!
phoebe Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
monica Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
phoebe I know, I took it hard too.
monica Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
rachel I'm unpacking!
monica What?!
rachel I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
monica It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
rachel Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
monica Because it's my apartment!
rachel Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
monica How about, you're moving!!
rachel Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
phoebe Hey, how are you guys doing?
rachel Great! Monica's moving!
monica I am not!
rachel Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
phoebe Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
monica No Phoebe I am mad!
phoebe Well, deep-deep-deep down!
rachel Yeah, I'm just mad!
phoebe Then keep running.
chandler You win.
joey Well, what did you have?
chandler It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
joey Uh, wow, 700.
chandler Not 700 exactly?
joey Yeah.
chandler Double it!
joey What?
chandler Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
joey Really?
chandler Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
monica Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
rachel Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
phoebe Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
monica_and_rachel What?!
phoebe You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
rachel Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
monica Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
rachel Oh really? Like what Monica?
monica Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots
rachel Oh yeah, good start Mon.
monica She lets you borrow them.
rachel Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
monica Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
phoebe What else?
monica When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
rachel Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
phoebe That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
monica When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
rachel Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
monica And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
rachel Oh, it's gonna be fine.
phoebe Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
rachel But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
phoebe Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
monica Kinda. Oh my God!
ross Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
joey Hey!
chandler What's wrong?
joey Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
chandler Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
joey The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
chandler Oh man!!
joey And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
chandler All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
joey No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
chandler I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
joey It's him, not it!
chandler No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
joey Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
chandler When did I try to give you money?
joey Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
chandler I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
joey I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
monica Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
rachel Okay.
monica I'm really gonna miss you.
rachel Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
monica Thanks.
rachel Yeah.
rachel Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
monica Yeah.
rachel Bye house!
rachel Bye Mon.
monica Bye.
chandler Hey.
monica She really left.
chandler I know.
monica Thank you.
chandler No problem roomie.
monica Can I ask you a question?
chandler Sure!
monica What the hell is that dog doing here?!
chandler I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
ross And now you want that money back.
chandler Exactly.
ross Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
chandler It's not a real game! I made it up!
ross I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
chandler At a fake game!!
ross Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
chandler Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
ross No.
chandler Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
