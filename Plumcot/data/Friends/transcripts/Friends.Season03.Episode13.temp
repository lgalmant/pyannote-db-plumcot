monica Hi.
clerk Six dollars, please.
monica Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
clerk Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
monica Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
richard I can help with that.
monica Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
richard Hi!
monica Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
richard So, you look great.
monica Right.
richard No you do. You... just...
monica What?
richard You've got panties stuck to your leg.
monica That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
richard It's good to see you.
monica It's good to see you too.
monica You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
richard He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
monica Yeah.
richard I missed this.
monica Me too.
richard So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
monica Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
richard Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
monica No, I just I think that it's too soon.
richard No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
chandler Yeah, baby!
ross What are you doing?
chandler Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
ross No thanks. I'm 29.
rachel Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
ross Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
rachel Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
ross Oh come on, not again.
rachel I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
ross Hmm.
rachel For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
ross Yeah.
rachel I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
ross Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
rachel Right.
phoebe Hi.
all Hey.
joey Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
phoebe Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
ross And what are you going to do for him?
phoebe I'm going to let him.
ross Okay.
joey Cool.
monica Morning.
all Hey.
rachel Somebody got in late last night.
monica Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
rachel When did this happen?
monica Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
phoebe Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
ross So, are you gonna see him again?
monica Tomorrow night.
rachel Monica, what are you doing?
chandler Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
monica It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
joey Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
monica We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
ross Naked friends.
rachel Hey.
joey Hey.
rachel Do you have any ice?
joey Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
rachel Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
joey I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
rachel Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
joey Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
rachel But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
joey Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
rachel How often do you read it?
joey Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
rachel Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
joey The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
rachel Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
joey All right, you got it.
rachel All right.
joey Okay.
rachel Okay.
joey Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
rachel Yeah.
joey How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
phoebe Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
chandler Oh, hey.
robert Hi.
ross Hey.
phoebe You've have lipstick right here That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
ross Oh.
chandler So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
robert Well, I'm from California.
chandler Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
chandler I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
phoebe I'll have coffee.
robert Yeah, me too.
ross Yeah, make that three.
chandler Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
ross Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
chandler Robert's coming out.
ross What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
chandler No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
ross What?!
chandler The man is showing brain.
ross Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
robert Coffee.
ross Okay.
robert We could write it down for you?
ross No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
chandler Wellll?
ross Yeah, yeah, yeah!
chandler What do we do? What do we do?
ross Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
chandler Like an eclipse.
richard So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
monica You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
richard Ew, this feels very weird.
monica You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
richard Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
monica Oops.
richard Okay.
monica Gotta keep squishing.
richard Tomatoes are squishing.
monica Okay.
richard Op.
monica Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
richard Yeah.
monica Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
richard What?
monica Umm, you've got some on your pants.
richard I'll just throw them out.
joey These little women. Wow!
chandler Your liking it, huh?
joey Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
ross Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
joey But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
chandler No, actually Laurie's a boy.
joey No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
phoebe Hey!
chandler Hey.
ross Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
phoebe Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
chandler You mean a three pointer?
phoebe Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
robert So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
phoebe Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
robert Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
joey What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
robert Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
phoebe What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
ross Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
phoebe You guys!! Come on!
chandler I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
phoebe What do you mean?
robert Hey.
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
robert Sure.
monica So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
monica Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
richard You really sure?
monica I'll call you back.
monica So we can be friends who sleep together.
richard Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
monica Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
richard Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
monica Oh.
richard You want me to cancel it?
monica No! No!
richard Okay.
monica 'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
richard Exactly.
robert Hey.
phoebe Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
robert You ready to go to the batting cage?
phoebe Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
robert Oh! Wow! Hey!
chandler Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
robert Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
phoebe That's all right, that's well, I figured....
robert Hey!
joey Hey! How's it going?
ross Good.
joey Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
rachel Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
joey Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
rachel Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
joey All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
chandler Hmmm, that's very cool.
joey Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
rachel Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
chandler I can't believe she cracked your code!
rachel All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
joey Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
rachel Eh. Beth dies.
joey Beth, Beth dies?
rachel Um-hmm.
joey Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
chandler No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
rachel What?!
ross Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
rachel No. She doesn't die.
joey Then why would you say that?!
rachel Because, I wanted to hurt you.
robert Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
rachel Oh my....
robert Got 'em.
monica Hi.
rachel Sorry. I'm sorry.
monica You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
monica What are you smiling at?
rachel I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
monica Yeah, right.
richard Hello.
monica I love this friend thing!
phoebe Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
ross Oh.
phoebe Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
chandler We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
ross He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
robert Hey!
phoebe Hey.
robert So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
phoebe No, I can spot you from here.
robert What?
phoebe Okay, listen Robert...
ross Hey, don't we have to...
chandler Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
phoebe Umm, I think you're really, really great...
robert Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
phoebe I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
gunther Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
monica Ow!
richard Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
richards_date Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
monica Oh my God! Oh my God!
richard Ah well, this is the living room.
richards_date Impressive.
richard All right. This is the kitchen.
richards_date Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
richard The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
richards_date We're still on this side of the door.
richard Um-hmm.
richards_date Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
richard Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
monica So um, who was she?
richard Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
monica Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
richard Well, you seem fine.
monica Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
richard You mean like exclusive friends?
monica Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
richard Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
monica That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
richard Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
monica Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
richard I know I couldn't. So....
monica How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
monica Watch the thorns!
richard Ow!!
rachel What?
joey Beth is really, really sick.
rachel Awwww.
joey Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
rachel Joey?
joey Yeah.
rachel Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
joey Okay.
rachel Okay.
