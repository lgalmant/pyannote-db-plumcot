rachel Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
hilda What?
rachel I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
hilda No dear. It's not.
rachel No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.

rachel Uh-huh, go on.
tag That's it. That's my whole name.
rachel That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
tag I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh
rachel Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
tag It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn
rachel Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
chandler No-no-no-no. Hey!
phoebe Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
monica Hey sweetie.
chandler Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
monica I can't tell you. It's a secret.
chandler Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
monica Awww. But still no.
chandler No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
monica Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
chandler Oh no-no, I can't do that.
monica If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
chandler Okay.
monica Okay.
chandler So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
monica Oh my God. He threw up?
chandler No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
monica Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
chandler That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
monica That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
rachel Chandler, you have an assistant right?
chandler Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
rachel No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy
chandler What about him?
rachel I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
phoebe Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
rachel Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
phoebe Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
rachel Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
chandler Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
terry Hey-hey-hey Joey!

joey Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
terry Everybody has to audition.
joey Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
terry I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
joey Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
rachel Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
tag I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
rachel Kinda.
tag Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
rachel Oh-ohh, thank you.
tag Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
rachel Well
tag Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
rachel But I hired you!

monica Hey baby.
chandler Hey.

monica Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
ross Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
monica I'm not laughing.
ross You told her!
chandler Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
ross Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
monica You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
ross How could you tell her?!
chandler I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
ross Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
chandler Du-ude!
monica What happened in Atlantic City?!
ross Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
chandler Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
ross And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
monica You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
chandler In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
ross Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
chandler Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
ross Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.

They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
phoebe Sorry.
rachel I'm sorry Joey.
joey Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
chandler You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
ross All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
chandler Ross came in forth and cried!
monica Oh my God!
ross Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
monica I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
ross Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
monica Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!

monica It's hard for some people!
chandler Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
monica Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!

ross Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
joey How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
rachel Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
joey Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
phoebe What happened?
joey Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
rachel Joey, why would you do that?
joey Because they wanted me to audition!
phoebe You! An actor?! That's madness!

chandler You have no trouble telling time now right?
monica No!
chandler Quick! What time is it?!
monica I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
chandler Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
monica Yeah?
chandler Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
monica Ohh, absolutely.
ross And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
monica Yeah, definitely!
ross Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
monica Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
