rachel_green I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
dr_ross_geller Look I was going to tell you!
rachel_green When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller You're kidding!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!!
monica_geller Ross!
dr_ross_geller Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
chandler_bing Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
dr_ross_geller Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
phoebe_buffay Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
phoebe_buffay Another lie. You have a sickness!
chandler_bing Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
joey_tribbiani Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber's note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I'd have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?
gunther Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
joey_tribbiani Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
monica_geller Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
joey_tribbiani There's a lost and found? My shoe!
chandler_bing You left a shoe here?!
joey_tribbiani Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
chandler_bing Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
joey_tribbiani Great! Thanks.
phoebe_buffay Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
monica_geller Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
chandler_bing Yeah, all right.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
chandler_bing Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
phoebe_buffay Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
monica_geller Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
monica_geller Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
guy_1 Nice car!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it's not mine.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode05 I love your car.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it's mine.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode05 I bet it's fast.
joey_tribbiani Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode05 Yeah!
joey_tribbiani It's got 'em!
rachel_green So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
phoebe_buffay What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
rachel_green Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Maybe you could be my roommate!
rachel_green Well there's an idea!!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
phoebe_buffay Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
rachel_green December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
rachel_green Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
rachel_green Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
dr_ross_geller Okay Rach, but
rachel_green Op! You're peeping!
rachel_green Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
dr_ross_geller Look I told you
rachel_green I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
dr_ross_geller Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
rachel_green Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
dr_ross_geller What about the time I said we were on a break?
rachel_green Ugh!
monica_geller Pheebs, how's it going?
phoebe_buffay I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
monica_geller Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
chandler_bing Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
phoebe_buffay Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
chandler_bing See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
monica_geller What do you mean?
chandler_bing I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around
phoebe_buffay That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
chandler_bing Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
monica_geller This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
phoebe_buffay Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
chandler_bing Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
joey_tribbiani You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
chandler_bing What equity investments?
joey_tribbiani The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
monica_geller Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
chandler_bing You don't even have a car!
monica_geller I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
chandler_bing And?
monica_geller And six others.
chandler_bing There you are.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, she tops out at 130.
guy_2 Wow!
joey_tribbiani And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
guy_2 Really! You got a place upstate?
joey_tribbiani Sure!
guy_2 Well, I'll see you later.
joey_tribbiani Okay, take it easy.
the_porsche_owner Hey! That's my car.
joey_tribbiani Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
the_porsche_owner What-what are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
the_porsche_owner But it's my car!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but it's my wax.
the_porsche_owner Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
joey_tribbiani Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
the_porsche_owner I'm not coming back.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
the_porsche_owner I live upstate.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so did I.
phoebe_buffay I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
monica_geller Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
chandler_bing Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
monica_geller Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
chandler_bing He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
phoebe_buffay No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
chandler_bing They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
phoebe_buffay What?!
chandler_bing Glass, sand, whatever.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
monica_geller Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I can still do that.
monica_geller How are you still single?!
chandler_bing All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
monica_geller Good. What made you change your mind?
chandler_bing I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
phoebe_buffay How did that happen?!!
chandler_bing Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
monica_geller Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
the_judge Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
rachel_green Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
the_judge So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
dr_ross_geller Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
the_judge And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green Uh yes, heroin and crack.
dr_ross_geller Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
rachel_green Well, you would know.
the_judge Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on!
rachel_green Ross, please, I found the magazines!
the_judge And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
the_judge That won't be necessary.
dr_ross_geller And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
rachel_green Ugh!
the_judge Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
rachel_green Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
the_judge Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
rachel_green Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
the_judge Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
dr_ross_geller That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
rachel_green What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
dr_ross_geller And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
rachel_green Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
the_judge You need to get out of my chambers.
rachel_green All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
the_judge Would you like to spend the night in jail?
rachel_green And thank you for your time.
joey_tribbiani So the Porsche guy took his car back.
chandler_bing But you found the keys to his clothes?
joey_tribbiani No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
monica_geller And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
joey_tribbiani Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
chandler_bing That is true.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
monica_geller Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
joey_tribbiani Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
chandler_bing Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
monica_geller All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
phoebe_buffay What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
monica_geller The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
phoebe_buffay But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
monica_geller He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
phoebe_buffay But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
chandler_bing I think that's gum.
phoebe_buffay I'm pretty sure it's gun.
chandler_bing Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
phoebe_buffay A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
joey_tribbiani Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
the_passerby Maybe because you've got the keys?
joey_tribbiani Porsche.
rachel_green This is totally your fault!
dr_ross_geller My fault?! You threatened the judge!
rachel_green Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
dr_ross_geller That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
joey_tribbiani Hi! How are the Gellers?
rachel_green Don't call us that!
dr_ross_geller The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
joey_tribbiani Hey! It's Porsche!!
phoebe_buffay Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay How do you feel?
chandler_bing Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
phoebe_buffay Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
chandler_bing And protected them from a tornado?
monica_geller Oh my God.
phoebe_buffay I know, the babies are asleep.
monica_geller Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
phoebe_buffay I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
monica_geller But my apartment!
chandler_bing Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
monica_geller But the mess!
chandler_bing Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
monica_geller You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
chandler_bing Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
rachel_green Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
dr_ross_geller I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
rachel_green Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
dr_ross_geller Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
rachel_green Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
dr_ross_geller Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
rachel_green Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Right!
dr_ross_geller You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
rachel_green Nothing.
dr_ross_geller Okay, can we just sign please?
rachel_green Uh-hmm.
dr_ross_geller Congratulations.
rachel_green Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
dr_ross_geller Excuse me?
rachel_green Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
rachel_green And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
dr_ross_geller So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
rachel_green Yeah, don't push it though.
dr_ross_geller I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
rachel_green I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
dr_ross_geller Did I, did I even treat?
rachel_green No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
dr_ross_geller That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
rachel_green Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
dr_ross_geller Eh, no problem.
rachel_green I'm gonna need a copy of those.
dr_ross_geller Totally.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode05 Hi Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey! How you doin'?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode05 He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
joey_tribbiani I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
