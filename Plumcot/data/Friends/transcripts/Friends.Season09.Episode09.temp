jo_lynn This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
chandler Yep.That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.Single are ya?
chandler Chandler Bing.
joey Hey.How come you're answering your own phone?Where's your crazy assistant?
chandler What's up Joe?
joey Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
chandler Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
joey No, no, no.When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks gamecourtside!
chandler Courtside?Oh my God.
joey Yeah.Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
chandler That's so cool.I'll let Monica know.
monica Hello?
chandler Joey just called.He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
monica Really?But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
chandler But hey, it's courtside.The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. That's not the way to convince you.
monica Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game.You have to spend time with me."So, if you could just realize it on your own
chandler I know.You're right.I want to see you too.I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?He's really looking forward to this.
monica Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
chandler Yeah, ah, ahI'll think of something.
ross Wow!Wow, You look uháIt's just, aháThat dress uhá
rachel Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
ross Well, well, they're good.It's been a while since I've seen you like this.You, you clean up good.
rachel Oh well, well thank you.Okay, stop.Stop looking at me like that.The last time that happened, that happened.á
ross Oh right, right.So, are you ah you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
rachel Yeah, yeah.Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
ross Oh, it's fine.Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
rachel Phoebe's Mike?
ross Yeah.
rachel I didn't know you guys hung out.
ross We don't.But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
rachel Oh that's so cute:Ross and Mike's first date.Is that going to be awkward?I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
ross I don't know.But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Hi
rachel Hey.
phoebe Oooh.Girl's night out indeed.
rachel Ok.So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross
ross Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?You go have fun.
rachel Okay.You too.And I hope you score.Bye.
mike Bye.
ross SoWelcome.
mike I got beer.
ross I got bottled breast milk.

ross No.
mike Okay.á
ross Um ah you know, I'm divorced.Um, Phoebe, ah Phoebe said you You've been divorced?

ross That's okay.We'll talk about something else.á
mike So, you're a paleontologist, right?
ross Yeah.

monica Hi.
chandler Hey.
monica Welcome home.
chandler Oh well, look at you.
monica Yeah.What do you think?
chandler Well, it looks great.It's just that well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.So
monica Oh.
chandler See what I mean
joey Hey!How come the door's locked?
monica Just a second.
chandler No, no, no, no, no.Joey can't know that I'm here.
monica Why not?
chandler Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
monica So, you lied to him?
chandler Achhh.It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.Except with you.
joey Hey!Open the door.What's going on?á
joey What are you.Why are you dressed like that?
monica Oh, because, umwell, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
joey Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
monica Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?""Really sexy.Could I BE any more turned on?"
joey Okay.Whoa, whoa.Why are there two glasses of wine out?
monica Because.one of them is for you.
monica Cheers.Okay, buh-bye.á
chandler You know, it's funny.I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.Hi ya.
monica You might want to keep practicing.
chandler Yah.
chandler It's Joey.Hey Joe.
joey Dude, come home!
chandler What? Why?
joey COMEHOME.
chandler Look I, I can't.What's going on?
joey I don't know how to tell you this but, uh I think Monica's cheatin' on ya.I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
joey All right look.If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.
chandler NO!
joey I just heard him!
chandler Can you hear him now?
joey No.All right, I'm going in.
chandler No! Wait!
joey I heard him again!
chandler All right, look.Just stay there.I'm coming home.
joey Okay.Great.I'll see you when you get here.I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
chandler Is that really necessary?
joey Absolutely.You'd do it for me.Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
ross Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.Well, how long has it been?
mike Eleven minutes.And now twelve.So, do you like the beer?
ross I do.I do.Although, it's actually a lager.
mike huh.What's the difference between beer and lager?
ross I don't know.We could look it up.
mike Things are about to get wild.
phoebe Oh God.Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
rachel Oh God.It seems like forever ago.
phoebe I know.áSo, what's going on with you and Ross?
rachel Well, um I don't know.I mean, for a long time nothing.But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a ah little thing.
phoebe Oh my God!I love things.What happened?
rachel Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.And, ah, then we had a little um eye-contact.
phoebe Eye-contact?
rachel Mm-hmm.
phoebe I hope you were using protection.
waiter Excuse me.Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
rachel Oh.Should we send them something back?
phoebe Oooh.Let's do.Let's send them mashed potatoes.
rachel No!Wait!No, no.Don't do that!That's going to make them think they can come over here.
phoebe So?What if they do?
rachel Well, we're not here to meet guys.You have a boyfriend, I have a b. baby and a Ross.
phoebe Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.We're just having fun.You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
monica Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
chandler Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?I heard it.
monica I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
chandler All right.I've got a plan.I'll go down the fire escape.
monica Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
chandler Hear me out woman.I'll go down the fire escape.Then, I'll wait for a while.Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
monica Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?I heard it.
chandler I'm just going to wait for a little while.
monica Scary pigeon's back?
chandler It's huge.
rachel Oh my God.I can't believe you live in that building.My grandmother lives in that building.Ida Green?No sense of personal space?Kind of smells like chicken?Looks like a potato.
bill "Spuds" is your grandmother?
rachel That's my bubby!
kevin So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.Um. maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
phoebe Yeah. I'm sorry.We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys.I, I have a boyfriend.
kevin All right. It's no big deal. BILL: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation? RACHEL: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.But um. BILL: Then, can I have your number? RACHEL: I'm sorry, no. BILL: Okay. RACHEL: Oh sure.PHOEBE: Oh my God, you're giving your real number. BILL: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight. RACHEL: Great. BILL: Bye PHOEBE: Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
rachel I don't know.He was cute, and he liked me.It was an impulse.
phoebe What about Ross?What about your moment?Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
rachel No.No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go."Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
rachel "Yeah.""Me too."
rachel "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
rachel "Yeah.""Me neither."
rachel "Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
rachel "Yeah.That works for me."
phoebe Yeah, I see what you mean.By the way, nice Ross imitation.
rachel Oh, thanks.
phoebe But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
rachel Wha. hey!
phoebe Better!
rachel Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?I should just move on with my life.
phoebe Really?You're moving on from Ross?
rachel I don't know.Do I have to decide right now?
phoebe Well, you kind of just did.That guy is going to call you tonight.Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
rachel Oh God, Ross.Ross is going to pick up the phone.Oh, I have to get my number back.Oh my God.He's gone.
phoebe "Oh, I have to get my number back.Oh my God.He's gone."Dead on.
mike Ya know, I'm going to take off.
ross So soon?
mike Well, yeah.
ross Okay.Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
mike Ah, you mean lager.
ross Ah yeah.Good times.
mike Oh.
mike Hello?
phoebe Hey, Mike, it's me.Listen, is um, is Ross near you?
mike Uh, no.I just left.
phoebe Well, you have to go back in.
mike Wha?Go back?To the "land where time stands still"?
phoebe I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.So, you have to intercept all his calls.
mike I can't do that!
phoebe He says he can't do that.
rachel Oh give me , , ,Hi, Mike?Hi.Listen.I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?If you do this I Phoebe will do anything you want.Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
phoebe All right. Hello?Hi.I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
mike All right.I'll do it.But really, how much dirtier can it get?
phoebe Oh, Mike.Bye.
mike Hey buddy.
ross Uh, hi.
mike Um, can I come back in?
ross Why?á
mike I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.
ross But you left.
joey Wow!That didn't take long.I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
chandler Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
monica Chandler!You're home!
chandler That's right.You're husband's home.So, now the sex can stop.
monica What are you saying?
chandler Joey said that you're in here with another man.
monica There's no man in here.How dare you accuse me of that.á
joey All right.All right.Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?Bwa-ah-ah!
chandler What is he doing?
monica I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
joey Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
chandler All right.Well, I'll check the guest room.
joey Why do I smell men's cologne?
monica I think that's you.
joey Oh yeah.I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
chandler There's nobody here Joe.
joey I guess not.
monica I can't believe you thought I was cheating.You own me an apology.
joey Yeah, right Monica.I'm so sorry.
monica Ah, it's an honest mistake.It could happen to anyone.All right, see ya.
joey Whoa, whoa.Wait a minute.Wait a minute.If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
chandler I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
mike So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.Fascinating isn't it.
ross Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
mike I'll get it.Hello?Ross's place.Mike speaking.It's for you.
ross I don't understand what just happened here.
joey What's going on?
chandler I'm sorry.I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't knowI didn't think you'd understand.
joey What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?Huh?Do you think I'm like, "Duh."á
monica Joey?
joey Yeah?á
monica I don't know what to say.We shouldn't have lied to you.
chandler Yeah.I feel so bad.Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
joey Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
chandler I'm sorry. áThat's the one thing I can't do.I promised I'd be with Monica.
joey All right.
monica You can go.
chandler What?
monica You should go to the game.It's okay.I want you to.
chandler Really?You're gonna be okay?
monica Yeah, I'll be fine.You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
chandler You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
monica It's gonna be so hot!á
chandler Okay, bye.
monica Have fun.
joey Thanks.Here's your ticket.
chandler Hey, listen.I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
