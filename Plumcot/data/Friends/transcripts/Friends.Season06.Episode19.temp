rachel Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
joey Great! Roomie!
rachel Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
joey Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
rachel I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
joey Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
rachel That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
joey All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
rachel You're jokin' right?
joey Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
rachel Thank God you're pretty.
rachel Hey!
all Hi! Hey!
rachel Do you guys know any cute guys?
chandler Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
joey Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
rachel Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go
monica What's the charity?
rachel I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
monica Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
rachel Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
phoebe Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
rachel Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
chandler So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
joey Ooh! So close.
ross Hey everybody!
all Hi!
ross Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
elizabeth Oh hi!
all Hi!
elizabeth I'm the student.
chandler Isn't she cute? No!
phoebe Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
elizabeth Oh, we're not together.
ross Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
phoebe Oh, sly.
elizabeth Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
all Okay!
elizabeth Bye Ross.
ross Bye.
elizabeth Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
ross Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
chandler So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
ross Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
chandler Oh, tell her good luck with that.
ross Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
rachel Oo! When's her birthday?!
ross I don't know Rachel, why?
rachel Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
monica Oh, I like Elizabeth.
ross Well thanks!
monica Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
joey Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
ross Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
monica Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
ross Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
phoebe Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
monica Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
chandler Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
chandler Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
phoebe Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
chandler Why would our guy be a weirdo?
phoebe 'Cause that's just your taste.
monica Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
phoebe Oh yeah?
monica Yeah!
phoebe My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
chandler A face ass?
phoebe A chin dimple!
monica Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
phoebe Have you seen your guy's body?
chandler No, our guy is just a floating head.
phoebe Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
monica You're not supposed to look!
phoebe Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
chandler Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
phoebe I know.
monica All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
phoebe Oh, Chandler funny?

chandler Our guy smells incredible.
monica Do you want our guy to be your guy?
chandler Hey.
joey Huh.
chandler Well, you...don't look good Joe.
joey The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
chandler That's still in there?!
joey Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
chandler Is this a service you're providing me?
joey No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
chandler Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
joey So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
chandler Uh-huh.
joey And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
chandler Okay
joey Give me $400!
elizabeth Professor Geller?
ross Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
elizabeth I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
ross Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
elizabeth Making out in your office.
ross Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
ross Oh-ooh!
elizabeth What?
ross Doorknob! Doorknob!
elizabeth Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
ross Oh, okay. What-what about?
elizabeth Spring vacation.
ross Spring vacation.
elizabeth Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips
professor_feesen Professor Geller!
ross Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
ross You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
chandler Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
ross I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
chandler Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
joey Or! You can just, y'know
ross What the hell are you doing?
joey What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
ross What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
joey Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
chandler Joey, I saw you push him!
joey You pushed him!
ross Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
joey All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
chandler Uh-huh.
joey I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
ross Do not give him any money!
joey I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
elizabeth You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
ross Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
ross Oo-oo!
elizabeth Doorknob?
ross Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
elizabeth Oh good.
ross Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
elizabeth Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
ross No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was
elizabeth You are so adorable.
ross That! Let's talk about that.
ross Hey!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
ross Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
chandler Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
ross What's-what's the difference?
monica Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
ross Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
phoebe What did you do on yours?
ross I went to Egypt with my dad.
chandler I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
ross Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
monica And slept with the professor.
ross I'm gonna call her.
chandler Yeah.
rachel Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
sebastian Hi.
rachel We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
sebastian Can I get you a cup of coffee?
rachel Oh yes! Thank you!
phoebe Rachel, what the hell is this?!
rachel What?
phoebe You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
rachel You found me a guy?
monica Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
phoebe Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
rachel Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
chandler Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
monica Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
sebastian Here you go.
rachel Oh, thank you.
sebastian Sure.
phoebe So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
sebastian Uh, no not really. Why?
phoebe No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
chandler Are you funny?
sebastian Excuse me?
rachel What are you guys doing?
monica Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
sebastian Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
phoebe Well, so do a lot of people.
sebastian Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
rachel Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
sebastian Okay! See you later!
chandler Turns out he is kinda funny.
rachel I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
chandler Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
phoebe Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
monica All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
phoebe Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
rachel All right.
chandler Okay, so you will meet our guys?
rachel Yes, I'll meet 'em.
chandler Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
joey Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
phoebe Okay sure!
joey Really?!
phoebe Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
joey Call it even?
phoebe Okay.
chandler Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
ross Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know
joey Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
chandler You know the hotels?
joey Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
monica In 1981 you were 13!
joey So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
ross Okay, she can't go.
phoebe Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
ross Then what am I supposed to do?
phoebe Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
ross Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
chandler Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
ross I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
elizabeth Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
ross Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
elizabeth What?
ross Are you into crafts at all?
elizabeth Ross, are you okay?
ross Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
elizabeth It's a bathing suit?
ross To wear in front of people?
elizabeth Is that supportive?
ross Is this?!
monica Hey!
chandler Good-good-good-good.
monica Hey!
chandler Hey!
rachel Hi!
monica We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
rachel Oh
monica You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
rachel I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
chandler Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
rachel What?
monica Eldad, this is Rachel.
eldad How are you?
rachel Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
chandler Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
rachel I-Ohh!
chandler There you go! There you are!
monica Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
phoebe This is Patrick.
patrick Hi.
chandler Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
phoebe Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
rachel Yeah?
phoebe This is Patrick.
rachel Oh, hi.
patrick Hi.
phoebe Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
rachel Yeah?
phoebe Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
rachel Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
phoebe Yeah?
rachel I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
phoebe Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
monica No! You can't do that!
eldad Maybe I should go!
monica Sit down! We're winning!
rachel Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
all No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
monica Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
chandler It is the softest hair! Touch it!
rachel Yeah, I'm good.
phoebe Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
patrick Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
monica That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
chandler Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
rachel No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
phoebe Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
rachel I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
eldad I'm a little embarrassed.
rachel I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
phoebe Then why did she ask us to
rachel I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
eldad Yes, Papaya Extract.
rachel Thank you!
ross So uh, have a great time down there.
elizabeth I will.
ross Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
elizabeth Yeah.
ross It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
elizabeth Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
ross Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
elizabeth Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
ross Really?
elizabeth Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
ross Okay. Cool.
elizabeth Oh hey! Here they are!
guy Elizabeth!
ross Call me!
phoebe Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
rachel Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
chandler So what was it for anyway?
rachel I wanna say a disease.
joey Hey!
all Hey!
joey I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
rachel Huh. All right.
phoebe Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
rachel Oh-oh Professor Geller.
joey Ahh, to be 13 again.
chandler Yeah.
