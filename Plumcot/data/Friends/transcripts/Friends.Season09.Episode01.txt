rachel_green Joey.
rachel_green Oh my God. Okay.
rachel_green So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
joey_tribbiani Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hey Joey. Hey you.
rachel_green Hey you.
joey_tribbiani Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
dr_ross_geller You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
rachel_green Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
dr_ross_geller Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
joey_tribbiani No.
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
monica_geller Hi! Hey look who's here!
jack_geller Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.
chandler_bing He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
dr_ross_geller Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
jack_geller She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
monica_geller Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
jack_geller So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?
chandler_bing Okay. Wow.
dr_ross_geller Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
rachel_green I know, I still need to talk to you.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
phoebe_buffay Oh and I need to talk to you.
monica_geller About what?
phoebe_buffay To see if know what these guys are talking about.
monica_geller Isn't she beautiful?
jack_geller Look at her, my first grandchild.
dr_ross_geller What about Ben?
jack_geller Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow.
phoebe_buffay Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
dr_ross_geller Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
phoebe_buffay Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.
dr_ross_geller Yeah right.
phoebe_buffay Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.
dr_ross_geller What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
phoebe_buffay Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
joey_tribbiani Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
chandler_bing Sure.
joey_tribbiani Dude I just did something terrible.
chandler_bing That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
joey_tribbiani No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
chandler_bing What?! Why does she think that?
joey_tribbiani Because it kinda looked like I did.
chandler_bing Again, what?!
joey_tribbiani Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
chandler_bing As we all are at some point during the day.
joey_tribbiani It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
chandler_bing Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
joey_tribbiani I guess.
chandler_bing And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
joey_tribbiani I know! I know it's awful.
chandler_bing Well, what did she say?
joey_tribbiani She said yes.
chandler_bing Does Ross know?
joey_tribbiani Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
chandler_bing Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I like that. Yeah
chandler_bing If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
joey_tribbiani Now let's not get carried away.
monica_geller I want a baby.
chandler_bing Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
monica_geller Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
chandler_bing I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
monica_geller Deal!
dr_ross_geller Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
jack_geller Noted.
dr_ross_geller I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
jack_geller Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
dr_ross_geller Actually umm
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hi.
phoebe_buffay Are you all right?
rachel_green Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! He did it?
rachel_green Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
rachel_green And you really think this is a good idea?
phoebe_buffay I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
rachel_green I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
phoebe_buffay Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
rachel_green Really?! Even Ross?
phoebe_buffay Especially Ross!
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
dr_ross_geller Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.
phoebe_buffay There he goes, your fianc√©e.
rachel_green I guess so.
phoebe_buffay Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
rachel_green I can't say that I'm surprised.
dr_ross_geller Dad, what are you doing?
jack_geller I think there are people in there having sex.
joey_tribbiani It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
jack_geller Wanna peek?
dr_ross_geller No!
jack_geller Come on!
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.
joey_tribbiani We're not peeking?
jack_geller Well I'm peeking. Oh my God!
chandler_bing Hello sir, you know Monica.
joey_tribbiani Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
rachel_green Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
joey_tribbiani Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
rachel_green Hey!
nurse_kitty Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
rachel_green Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
nurse_kitty It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.
joey_tribbiani Yowsa!
rachel_green Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
joey_tribbiani Dear Lord.
rachel_green I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that
rachel_green Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
joey_tribbiani Y'know, I don't really know her.
nurse_kitty Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding me?!
rachel_green It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
joey_tribbiani I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
phoebe_buffay Oh hey! Wait up!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
dr_ross_geller What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
phoebe_buffay No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
phoebe_buffay Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
dr_ross_geller I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
phoebe_buffay All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
dr_ross_geller No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.
phoebe_buffay And so engaged.
dr_ross_geller What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
phoebe_buffay Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
dr_ross_geller I didn't give her that ring!
phoebe_buffay Really?
dr_ross_geller No!
phoebe_buffay So whose ring is it?
dr_ross_geller It's mine.
phoebe_buffay Is it an engagement ring?
dr_ross_geller Yes!
phoebe_buffay But you didn't give it to her?
dr_ross_geller No!
phoebe_buffay But you were going to propose?
dr_ross_geller No!!
phoebe_buffay Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
dr_ross_geller Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.
phoebe_buffay Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
dr_ross_geller Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
phoebe_buffay No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
dr_ross_geller Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and...it does sound like something I would do.
chandler_bing Look, we can't stay in here forever.
monica_geller Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
chandler_bing This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
monica_geller Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
jack_geller Of course. I'll always be your dad.
chandler_bing I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
monica_geller It wasn't fun?!
chandler_bing Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
jack_geller Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
monica_geller The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.
jack_geller What?
monica_geller Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
jack_geller Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! I'll guard the door!
monica_geller Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
jack_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?
monica_geller Daddy?!
jack_geller Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip.
chandler_bing That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
jack_geller This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was
monica_geller Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
jack_geller You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
monica_geller I don't feel good right now.
jack_geller But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
chandler_bing Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey. I need to tell you something.
monica_geller Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
rachel_green Joey asked me marry him.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green Joey proposed to me.
monica_geller Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
rachel_green Well, I-I said yes.
monica_geller What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
rachel_green I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
monica_geller You can't marry him!
rachel_green Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
monica_geller Well do you love him?
rachel_green Sure.
monica_geller Sure?
rachel_green Yeah, I mean whatever.
monica_geller Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
rachel_green No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
chandler_bing You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
joey_tribbiani No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
chandler_bing Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
joey_tribbiani I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
chandler_bing Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
joey_tribbiani Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
chandler_bing Okay, look, just do it gently.
joey_tribbiani You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement.
rachel_green Surprised?
dr_ross_geller And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.
rachel_green I know.
dr_ross_geller I don't think you do.
rachel_green You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
dr_ross_geller Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
rachel_green Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
dr_ross_geller Joey proposed to you?
joey_tribbiani I can come back.
dr_ross_geller Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
joey_tribbiani No.
rachel_green Yes you did!
joey_tribbiani Actually, technically, I didn't.
rachel_green Well then why did you give me a ring?
dr_ross_geller Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?
joey_tribbiani No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
rachel_green Yes, you did!
joey_tribbiani No, I didn't!
rachel_green Yes, you did!
joey_tribbiani No, I didn't!
rachel_green Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
joey_tribbiani Ahhh!
rachel_green He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
dr_ross_geller Whoa! You were down on one knee?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!
dr_ross_geller Then what did happen?
rachel_green Yeah, what did happen?
joey_tribbiani Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
rachel_green Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
joey_tribbiani No, I didn't!
rachel_green Yes, you did!
joey_tribbiani No, I didn't!
rachel_green Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
joey_tribbiani Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
dr_ross_geller Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
joey_tribbiani I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
rachel_green Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
joey_tribbiani It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green You were gonna propose to me?
dr_ross_geller Uhh... No.
joey_tribbiani Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
dr_ross_geller But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
joey_tribbiani Dude, step up! I proposed.
dr_ross_geller No, you didn't!
joey_tribbiani Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
nurse_kitty Hey, she just woke up! She's hungry. Why don't we give this another try?
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you're not going to propose!
dr_ross_geller Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
rachel_green Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
joey_tribbiani Ah, it's beautiful.
nurse_kitty I'll come back for her later.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
rachel_green Oh wow, this feels weird.
dr_ross_geller Good weird?
rachel_green Wonderful weird.
joey_tribbiani Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
rachel_green Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
joey_tribbiani No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!
rachel_green She's perfect.
dr_ross_geller We're so lucky.
rachel_green We really are.
dr_ross_geller Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling
rachel_green I know. I know. I've feeling
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
rachel_green Yeah, maybe.
dr_ross_geller Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we...if... You're wearing the ring.
rachel_green Wh-what's that?
dr_ross_geller And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
rachel_green I'm sorry, what?
dr_ross_geller When you thought Joey proposed did...did you say yes?
jack_geller Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
monica_geller Hey dad!
chandler_bing Hey.
jack_geller Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? Thank you.
