joey_tribbiani Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
joey_tribbiani Huh?!
chandler_bing Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
chandler_bing Could we be more white trash?
monica_geller How desperate am I?
rachel_green Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
monica_geller I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
phoebe_buffay How come?
monica_geller Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
dr_ross_geller Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
monica_geller You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
rachel_green Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
joey_tribbiani Just pickle.
chandler_bing Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
rachel_green My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
chandler_bing Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
rachel_green You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
chandler_bing No. No!
joanna Hello, Rachel.
chandler_bing Well, not at first.
rachel_green What is she doing here?
rachel_green I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
chandler_bing Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
rachel_green Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
chandler_bing Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
rachel_green Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
chandler_bing Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
rachel_green Thank you.
chandler_bing I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
joey_tribbiani Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
judy_geller How's the hired help?
monica_geller Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
judy_geller What's this? Blue nail polish?
monica_geller Yeah, I thought it was cute.
judy_geller Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
monica_geller Let me ask you a question.
judy_geller Hmm.
monica_geller Why did you hire me?
judy_geller Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
monica_geller Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I didn't hear that.
monica_geller Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
phoebe_buffay Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
the_salesman Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
joey_tribbiani Uhhhh.
the_salesman Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
joey_tribbiani No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
the_salesman Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
monica_geller I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
all@ Nooo!!
chandler_bing it was like the Algonquin kids table.
the_salesman Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
joey_tribbiani Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
phoebe_buffay That's weird.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Your nails.
monica_geller Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
phoebe_buffay Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
monica_geller Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
phoebe_buffay Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat - that's the problem.
judy_geller Honey, don't bite your nails.
monica_geller Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
phoebe_buffay And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
judy_geller I'm not freaking out.
monica_geller Then why are you laughing?
judy_geller It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
monica_geller What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
judy_geller Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
monica_geller Frozen lasagnas?
judy_geller Um-hmm.
monica_geller You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was
judy_geller No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
monica_geller You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
judy_geller Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
monica_geller That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
phoebe_buffay I don't get it.
judy_geller No, I have faith
monica_geller No! You have lasagnas!
oven#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode03 Ding!
phoebe_buffay Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
chandler_bing It just doesn't... feel like we're breaking up.
joanna No, we are. I'm sad.
chandler_bing Okay.
joanna Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
chandler_bing Thanks.
joanna No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
chandler_bing Okay.
joanna What are you doing?
chandler_bing I'm getting dressed.
joanna Why?
chandler_bing When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
joanna Wait. I wanna show you something.
chandler_bing What is it?
joanna Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
chandler_bing Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
joanna I'll be back in ten minutes.
chandler_bing You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
joanna Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
chandler_bing Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
joanna Oh.
sophie Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
joanna Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
rachel_green That's weird, she locked the door.
sophie Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
rachel_green Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
sophie Yeah!
chandler_bing Hi! How are you?
chandler_bing Hello, Joanna... ... 's office.
joanna I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
chandler_bing How little?!
joanna A couple of hours, I feel awful.
chandler_bing Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
joanna I can't!!
chandler_bing Why not?!
joanna I'm in my boss's car!
chandler_bing What?!
joanna Uh-oh, tunnel.
rachel_green What?!
chandler_bing Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
chandler_bing Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
rachel_green You promised you would break up with her!
chandler_bing I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
rachel_green And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
chandler_bing It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
rachel_green Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
chandler_bing No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
rachel_green Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
chandler_bing Never!
rachel_green You never come into this office again!
chandler_bing Fine!
rachel_green You give me back my Walkman!
chandler_bing I - never borrowed your Walkman.
rachel_green Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
chandler_bing You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
rachel_green Does it hurt?
chandler_bing No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
rachel_green Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
chandler_bing About what?
rachel_green When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
chandler_bing I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
rachel_green No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
chandler_bing Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
chandler_bing Well, this is much better.
the_salesman So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
joey_tribbiani He cut off his ear.
the_salesman And?
joey_tribbiani I'm out.
the_salesman He painted that.
joey_tribbiani Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
the_salesman Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
joey_tribbiani In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
the_salesman Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
joey_tribbiani Spock's birth control.
the_salesman You need these books.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hi.
phoebe_buffay This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
monica_geller Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
phoebe_buffay Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
monica_geller Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
phoebe_buffay No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
monica_geller All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
phoebe_buffay Wow! My breasts are really strong.
rachel_green Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
chandler_bing Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
rachel_green What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
chandler_bing It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
rachel_green Foot rubs for a month!
chandler_bing Freedom!
rachel_green I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
chandler_bing Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
rachel_green Sophie sit!!
rachel_green No! God, would you just calm down!
chandler_bing I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just
joey_tribbiani Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
the_salesman So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
joey_tribbiani Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
the_salesman Well ah, what can you swing?
joey_tribbiani How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
the_salesman You don't have, anything?
joey_tribbiani You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
the_salesman Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
joey_tribbiani And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
the_salesman For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
rachel_green I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
chandler_bing No!
rachel_green I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
chandler_bing With extra pulp?
rachel_green Yeah!!
chandler_bing No!
rachel_green D'oh!! I've got it!
chandler_bing You don't have it.
rachel_green I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
chandler_bing How do Monica and Phoebe know?
rachel_green Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
chandler_bing Go on.
rachel_green I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
chandler_bing And Milton Berle has a
rachel_green Ohh, not compared to you.
monica_geller Well?
phoebe_buffay They're not even touching the lasagna!
monica_geller Really?!
phoebe_buffay Oh, they love your casserole.
monica_geller Yes!!
phoebe_buffay It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
judy_geller Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
monica_geller And you?
judy_geller I thought it was... quite tasty.
monica_geller So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you
judy_geller A bitch?
monica_geller Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
judy_geller Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
monica_geller Wow!
phoebe_buffay Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
judy_geller And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
monica_geller That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
chandler_bing Hello.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani@rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hello, Chandler.
chandler_bing I love you.
joey_tribbiani Wh-what's going on?
phoebe_buffay Oh.
joey_tribbiani No he doesn't!
chandler_bing Two hours, that lasted!
rachel_green So did you break up with Joanna?
chandler_bing I think so.
joey_tribbiani Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
dr_ross_geller The volcano?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
rachel_green What?!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
monica_geller Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
joey_tribbiani Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
monica_geller Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
all@ Oh, yeah. Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
dr_ross_geller With such a sad history.
chandler_bing Could there be more Kims?
joanna Who's out there?
rachel_green It's me! Good morning!
joanna Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
rachel_green Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
joanna I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
rachel_green Oh, yeah! Yeah!
joanna You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
rachel_green Okay.
