rachel Come on Joey!!!
joey Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
rachel I can't believe you would say that!
joey Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
rachel No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
joey I don't know.
rachel Is he romantic with her?
joey I don't know.
rachel Are they in love?
joey I don't know.
rachel You don't know anything.
joey Ohh, I know one thing!
rachel What?
joey They did it right there on the couch.
joey Hey Ross!
phoebe Hey!
ross Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
all What? Oh!
chandler Sorry man.
gunther Here's your scone.
ross Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
chandler Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
phoebe Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
rachel Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
phoebe Exactly! Because it's in the past!
joey Anybody gonna eat that?
monica Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
chandler Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
monica I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
chandler I know, I can do this.
monica Ooh, and I can do this.
both We can't do that.
doug Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?

chandler What?
monica That noise you just made?
chandler Oh, that was my work laugh.

monica All right, check me out.
chandler Okay.
doug ...says $30 Father; same as in town.
chandler Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
monica Really?
chandler And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
monica Hey, I thought you already had one.
chandler Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
rachel Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
chandler Okay, good luck with that.
rachel Hey!
monica Hi!
rachel What's up?!
monica What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
rachel Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
monica Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.

rachel Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
monica Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
rachel No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
phoebe Okay, then what happened?
phoebe Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
ross Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
phoebe Nothing! This is not over!

chandler Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
monica I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
chandler Oopsey, missed it!
monica I got it!
doug Nice shot.
monica I got it!!
chandler Long!
monica I can't believe you let them win!
chandler Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
monica I was frustrated.
chandler It was my racquet.
monica I was frustrated with you!
chandler If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
monica Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
chandler Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
monica I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
joey Maybe we should check the trash chute.
rachel Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
joey That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
phoebe Hey!
rachel There he is!
monica Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
ross Just, y'know out.
rachel Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
phoebe What were you doing?
ross I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
rachel You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
joey He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
ross Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
joey He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
janice Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
janice Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
rachel Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
janice So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
phoebe Oh, nobody's judging you.
janice Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
ross Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
phoebe You two will have very hairy children.
ross Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
rachel Ross! Janice?!
joey All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
ross Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
phoebe So are you actually gonna see her again?
joey Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
ross I am gonna see her again.
joey Damnit Phoebe!!
rachel Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
monica My turn? What-what are you talking about?
rachel Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
monica What?!
rachel I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
monica Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
rachel Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
monica Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
rachel What?!
monica Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
rachel All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
monica Me and Chandler?!
joey All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
phoebe Uh-hmm.
joey All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
phoebe Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
joey Judge rules, no violation.
phoebe Ohhh.
ross Hey guys!
phoebe Hey!
joey Yeah!
ross Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
joey What?!
phoebe Are you serious?!
ross Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
phoebe You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We
joey And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
phoebe No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
joey Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
phoebe Ohh, tough call.
joey Yeah.
doug But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
kara So how do you kids like your coffee?
monica Oh, none for me. Thanks.
chandler Just a little bit of sugar.
doug Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
monica How does that laugh not give you a headache?
chandler Oh, you get used to it.
monica Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
chandler So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
monica I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
chandler Oh.
doug Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
chandler What?
doug The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
chandler Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
doug Excuse me?
chandler Well, I just
monica Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
chandler Really?
monica Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
chandler I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
monica I thought you could use the help.
chandler Coffee in a fight!
joey Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
rachel Sure! Why?
joey Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
rachel What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
chandler All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
monica Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
chandler But we're not ready to tell yet!
monica I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
monica Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
rachel Hey! Hi!
monica Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
rachel Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
monica Okay great!
rachel Yeah!
monica Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
rachel Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
monica Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
rachel That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
monica Okay.
rachel Okay.
monica I'll get back to my new job.
rachel 'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
chandler Man, she is really gullible.
gunther Here you go.
ross Thanks!
janice Actually, I should get going.
ross Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
janice Yes! Yes! You did!
ross Oh
janice What is wrong now?!
ross This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then
janice I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
ross Okay. Sometimes I feel
janice No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
ross Huh?
janice You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
ross Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
janice Well yeah!!
ross OH...MY...GOD!!
janice Are you gonna be okay?
ross I am now.
janice Okay.
joey Umm, hi.
janice Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
ross Dude, we got to talk.
chandler Okay.
ross I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
chandler Why would I be mad?
ross Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
chandler I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
ross Okay.
chandler I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
ross All right.
chandler And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
