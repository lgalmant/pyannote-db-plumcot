monica_geller Mmh... this cake is amazing!
rachel_green My God, get a room!
monica_geller I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
phoebe_buffay If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
monica_geller Sex!
chandler_bing Seriously, answer faster!
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
chandler_bing It's like a giant hug.
phoebe_buffay Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
dr_ross_geller Food.
phoebe_buffay Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
rachel_green Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
joey_tribbiani Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
rachel_green No, you gotta pick one!
joey_tribbiani Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
rachel_green You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
phoebe_buffay Oh, how cute!
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
rachel_green Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
phoebe_buffay Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
rachel_green Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
phoebe_buffay OH! He's having an affair.
rachel_green He's not having an affair!
phoebe_buffay You know, I'm always right about these things.
rachel_green No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
rachel_green Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
chandler_bing Hello.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so.....I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
chandler_bing Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
chandler_bing Those are all really old!
phoebe_buffay Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
rachel_green "Dude, Where's My Car?"
phoebe_buffay What?
rachel_green They're in a caaar...
phoebe_buffay Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
rachel_green Geez!
phoebe_buffay Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
rachel_green Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
phoebe_buffay I got them!
chandler_bing Hi!
monica_geller Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
chandler_bing I was in the car with Nancy all day.
monica_geller Nancy doesn't smoke!
chandler_bing Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
monica_geller So? What do you think of the house?
chandler_bing It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
monica_geller Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
chandler_bing And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
monica_geller Don't you love the huge yard?
chandler_bing And the fireplace in the bedroom.
monica_geller And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
chandler_bing This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
monica_geller So? Do you think we should get it?
chandler_bing I don't know. What do you think?
monica_geller I think we should.
chandler_bing I do too.
monica_geller This is huge!
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
chandler_bing I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
monica_geller Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
chandler_bing We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
monica_geller Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
chandler_bing I know. Gooooood luck with it.
dr_ross_geller I just can't see Chandler cheating!
rachel_green I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
joey_tribbiani Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
dr_ross_geller I know, and with the baby coming?
phoebe_buffay So, should we tell her?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
phoebe_buffay Why? Who'd you seen him with?
dr_ross_geller No one, I'm just saying if...
phoebe_buffay TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
dr_ross_geller I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
phoebe_buffay All right. He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
dr_ross_geller Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I...
phoebe_buffay WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
rachel_green Oh, look at her, so happy!
monica_geller If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
joey_tribbiani Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
monica_geller No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?
phoebe_buffay Well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.
monica_geller All right...
dr_ross_geller We think Chandler might be having an affair.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
phoebe_buffay They went in together. So sorry.
monica_geller Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
monica_geller Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani You son of a bitch!
chandler_bing Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
monica_geller Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
rachel_green Who's Nancy?
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
monica_geller Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
chandler_bing Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
joey_tribbiani I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
phoebe_buffay Why do you have a realtor?
monica_geller Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
joey_tribbiani What?
rachel_green Are you serious?
monica_geller When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
phoebe_buffay So you're gonna move?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God.
joey_tribbiani Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
rachel_green What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
monica_geller And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
chandler_bing ..and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
dr_ross_geller So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
phoebe_buffay Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
dr_ross_geller You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
joey_tribbiani No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
dr_ross_geller It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
chandler_bing Actually, we already found a house we love.
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
chandler_bing Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
dr_ross_geller You put an offer on a house?
monica_geller It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
phoebe_buffay Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
chandler_bing I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
joey_tribbiani Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
chandler_bing You know that's not the reason Joe.
monica_geller We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
rachel_green Yeah it is.
joey_tribbiani What the hell are you doin'?
rachel_green Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but so is this.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
rachel_green C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
dr_ross_geller You can see where he'd have trouble.
rachel_green Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
monica_geller Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
dr_ross_geller That money is mine, Green!
rachel_green You're fly is open, Geller!
phoebe_buffay You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
chandler_bing Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
phoebe_buffay Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
rachel_green Ow, that had to hurt!
phoebe_buffay Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode10 We will.
monica_geller Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
rachel_green No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
monica_geller Every year.
joey_tribbiani It's stuck!!!
phoebe_buffay Easy. Step. How did it get on?
joey_tribbiani I put it on to scare Chandler!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
joey_tribbiani It smells really bad in here.
phoebe_buffay Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
monica_geller Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
joey_tribbiani It's Joey.
monica_geller I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
rachel_green Oooohh that's interesting.
chandler_bing If you win, we give up the birds.
joey_tribbiani Dah!!
chandler_bing But if we win, we get your apartment.
joey_tribbiani Oooooh!
monica_geller Deal!
dr_ross_geller What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
joey_tribbiani Big fat goalie.
dr_ross_geller Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
chandler_bing Dangerous Liaisons.
dr_ross_geller Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
joey_tribbiani Weekend at Bernie's.
dr_ross_geller Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
joey_tribbiani Everyday use.
chandler_bing Fancy.
joey_tribbiani Guest.
chandler_bing Fancy guest.
dr_ross_geller Two seconds...
joey_tribbiani Uhh, 11!
dr_ross_geller 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
dr_ross_geller Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
rachel_green 14?
dr_ross_geller No, 19.
chandler_bing Thanks man.
dr_ross_geller Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
monica_geller Maurice.
dr_ross_geller Correct, his profession was?
rachel_green Space cowboy!
dr_ross_geller Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
rachel_green Ow...Oh Gosh!
dr_ross_geller 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
monica_geller It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
rachel_green Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
monica_geller That's not even a word!
monica_geller NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
rachel_green Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
joey_tribbiani Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
rachel_green That is not true. She did! She forced me!
monica_geller Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
rachel_green Well it stupid, unfair question!
dr_ross_geller Don't blame the questions!
chandler_bing Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
dr_ross_geller Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
chandler_bing Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
monica_geller Hey Ross. What's up bro?
dr_ross_geller What the hell are doing?!!
rachel_green Hey, what's-what's going on?!
chandler_bing Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
joey_tribbiani Dude! He's right there!
dr_ross_geller I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
chandler_bing Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
monica_geller I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
dr_ross_geller My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
monica_geller Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
rachel_green Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
monica_geller@rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
rachel_green Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
monica_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
phoebe_buffay What else?
monica_geller When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
rachel_green Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
phoebe_buffay That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
monica_geller When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
rachel_green Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
monica_geller And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller She really left.
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller Thank you.
chandler_bing No problem roomie.
monica_geller Can I ask you a question?
chandler_bing Sure!
monica_geller What the hell is that dog doing here?!
chandler_bing Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
all@ That's so sweet.
dr_ross_geller And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
rachel_green And a crappy New Year.
chandler_bing Here, here!
rachel_green You can't move. You just... you just can't.
joey_tribbiani Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
dr_ross_geller You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
rachel_green Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
chandler_bing Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
monica_geller And?
chandler_bing Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
monica_geller We can't afford that.
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller Well, there you go.
joey_tribbiani I'm really sorry you guys.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
rachel_green Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
phoebe_buffay You're gonna be okay?
monica_geller Yeah, we'll be okay.
dr_ross_geller Love you guys.
joey_tribbiani You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
chandler_bing That's okay, we understand.
joey_tribbiani And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
monica_geller I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
chandler_bing Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing We got the house.
monica_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
monica_geller Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
chandler_bing We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
monica_geller And a baby...
chandler_bing We're growing up.
monica_geller We sure are.
chandler_bing So who's gonna tell them?
monica_geller Not it!
chandler_bing Not it! Damn it!
monica_geller Rachel, this is yours.
rachel_green Aah! Why? What are these for?
chandler_bing You'll see.
monica_geller All right, everybody open them!
rachel_green Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
phoebe_buffay Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
monica_geller I know.
dr_ross_geller I love this.
joey_tribbiani A meatball Sub? Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
chandler_bing Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
monica_geller Enjoy!
joey_tribbiani What did they say?
