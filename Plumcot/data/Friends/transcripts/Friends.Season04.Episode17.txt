mr_treeger Ohhh, man!!
joey_tribbiani What is that?
chandler_bing Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
mr_treeger What in the name of hell?
joey_tribbiani Maybe he found you flip-flop.
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
chandler_bing Do we pay for this?
joey_tribbiani No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
chandler_bing Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
joey_tribbiani Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
mr_treeger Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
chandler_bing Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
mr_treeger Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
chandler_bing Like finding money with naked people on it!
mr_treeger Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
joey_tribbiani Why would he turn off the TV?
rachel_green All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no-no!
chandler_bing We don't know what could make this go away.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
chandler_bing And no one touches the air around the TV!
joey_tribbiani Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
monica_geller Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no!
chandler_bing We still have porn.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
monica_geller Hi!
rachel_green Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green Give it here. Oh, God.
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
chandler_bing Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
phoebe_buffay You mean like a doctor?
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
phoebe_buffay Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
monica_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
monica_geller Oh. Why didn't you take her?
dr_ross_geller Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so
monica_geller You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
dr_ross_geller Nah.
monica_geller Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
dr_ross_geller Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
monica_geller No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
dr_ross_geller And why do you care so much?
monica_geller Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
dr_ross_geller You had fantasies about Emily?
monica_geller No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
dr_ross_geller Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
monica_geller Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
dr_ross_geller Ahh.
monica_geller Do you love her?
dr_ross_geller We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
monica_geller You love her!
dr_ross_geller What-what is love really?
monica_geller Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
dr_ross_geller I am a good kisser.
monica_geller Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
rachel_green Is that the heartbeat?
the_doctor That's it.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
rachel_green Oh wow! This is so cool.
the_doctor Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
phoebe_buffay Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
the_doctor No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
phoebe_buffay Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
the_doctor Doctors are wrong all the time.
phoebe_buffay Well, yeah.
rachel_green Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
the_doctor Definitely.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
the_doctor Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
phoebe_buffay What do you know?!
alice_knight_buffay Oh-oh, Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! Hi!
alice_knight_buffay Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
phoebe_buffay Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
frank_buffay_jr Yes.
phoebe_buffay Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
alice_knight_buffay Three babies?
frank_buffay_jr I finally got my band!
alice_knight_buffay We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
phoebe_buffay Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
frank_buffay_jr Why would we be freaked?
phoebe_buffay No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and
frank_buffay_jr Oh.
alice_knight_buffay Right.
phoebe_buffay No, back to happy. Back to happy!
alice_knight_buffay No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
alice_knight_buffay No, Frank.
phoebe_buffay No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, refrigerator college.
alice_knight_buffay Yeah.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
phoebe_buffay You can't give up on your dream.
frank_buffay_jr No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
ticket_agent#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode17 This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
dr_ross_geller Emily!
emily_waltham Oh my God! What are you doing here?
dr_ross_geller I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
emily_waltham You are so sweet.
dr_ross_geller That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
emily_waltham Me too.
ticket_agent#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode17 This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
emily_waltham Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
dr_ross_geller Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
emily_waltham Oh. Thank you.
dr_ross_geller That's no problem.
rachel_green What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
chandler_bing It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
rachel_green Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
joey_tribbiani Yeah right.
rachel_green No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
chandler_bing Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
rachel_green Yes!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, he likes porn.
monica_geller Where ya going?
rachel_green I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller How did it go with Frank and Alice?
phoebe_buffay Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
chandler_bing They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
monica_geller Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
dr_ross_geller I did.
monica_geller And well, what did she say?
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
monica_geller Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
dr_ross_geller She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
chandler_bing Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
dr_ross_geller What do I do now?
joey_tribbiani You play hard to get.
dr_ross_geller She already lives in London.
joey_tribbiani Then you go to Tokyo.
chandler_bing All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
monica_geller It is not over! You're over!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller You know!
chandler_bing Okay. Good one.
monica_geller It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
dr_ross_geller Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
joey_tribbiani Way to be strong, man!
rachel_green Hey!
chandler_bing Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
rachel_green Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
chandler_bing Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
rachel_green Well, what-what 'cha got there?
phoebe_buffay Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking
chandler_bing Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
monica_geller Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
phoebe_buffay No!
monica_geller Are you sure?
phoebe_buffay No!
rachel_green Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
phoebe_buffay No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
chandler_bing What's the second part of your plan?
phoebe_buffay My Saturn dealership.
dr_ross_geller Hello?
emily_waltham Ross.
dr_ross_geller Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
emily_waltham It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
dr_ross_geller No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
emily_waltham Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
dr_ross_geller Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
dr_ross_geller She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
monica_geller This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
dr_ross_geller Well
monica_geller Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
dr_ross_geller I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
chandler_bing You put your fist through the wall?
dr_ross_geller No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
monica_geller You have to go to London!
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
monica_geller When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
dr_ross_geller I made fun of his accent.
monica_geller You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
dr_ross_geller No.
monica_geller All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
dr_ross_geller Really?
monica_geller Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
dr_ross_geller All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
monica_geller All right.
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
monica_geller Okay, good luck!
joey_tribbiani Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
monica_geller That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
rachel_green Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised
phoebe_buffay I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
chandler_bing A place where no one will ever get out alive?
phoebe_buffay No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's
rachel_green Relaxi-Taxi!
phoebe_buffay The name was my favourite part!
rachel_green Well, well I can up with it!
phoebe_buffay YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
rachel_green Well, I
monica_geller Hello.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
dr_ross_geller No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
monica_geller All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
dr_ross_geller About four hours.
monica_geller Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
phoebe_buffay Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
rachel_green Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
phoebe_buffay Oh, that is better.
chandler_bing Are we in London?
monica_geller What are you doing here? You can't be here!
emily_waltham I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
emily_waltham What?
joey_tribbiani Nothing. No, nothing.
emily_waltham I was going to call him, but
monica_geller Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
emily_waltham I'd really rather talk to him.
monica_geller Oh.
emily_waltham I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
emily_waltham Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
dr_ross_geller I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
emily_waltham I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
emily_waltham Ross, I love you!
dr_ross_geller Ohh! Thank you.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
joey_tribbiani Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
chandler_bing What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
joey_tribbiani Noo! Nothing!
chandler_bing Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
joey_tribbiani I think you're right.
chandler_bing All right, ready?
joey_tribbiani One.
chandler_bing Two.
