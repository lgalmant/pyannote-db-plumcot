chandler_bing OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
rachel_green So, how was the party?
chandler_bing Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed
phoebe_buffay No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
chandler_bing Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
phoebe_buffay No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
monica_geller Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
chandler_bing Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
monica_geller Please.
all@ C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
chandler_bing Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
phoebe_buffay Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
chandler_bing OK, let's do it. What?
monica_geller Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
chandler_bing And we're changing.
monica_geller C'mon give me five more. Five more.
chandler_bing No.
monica_geller Five more and I'll flash you.
chandler_bing One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
chandler_bing Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
rachel_green Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
phoebe_buffay Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
joey_tribbiani The guy still won't put out, huh?
phoebe_buffay Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
all@ Sorry Phoebs.
phoebe_buffay Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
joey_tribbiani Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
phoebe_buffay No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
joey_tribbiani Maybe he's. . . gay.
phoebe_buffay Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
rachel_green Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
phoebe_buffay No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
monica_geller Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
chandler_bing Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
rachel_green What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
joey_tribbiani Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
rachel_green Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
joey_tribbiani But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
rachel_green Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
chandler_bing So you really OK about all this?
rachel_green Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
dr_ross_geller Hi guys.
all@ Hey.
dr_ross_geller Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
monica_geller Only if you say his full name.
dr_ross_geller Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
monica_geller Alright.
joey_tribbiani You're getting a cat?
dr_ross_geller Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.

dr_ross_geller Uh huh.
rachel_green Both of you?
dr_ross_geller Yep.
rachel_green Together.
julie Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
rachel_green Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
dr_ross_geller Hopefully.
rachel_green Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
michael I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
rachel_green How long do cats live?
michael I'm sorry?
rachel_green Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
michael Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
rachel_green That's just great.
michael Um, cheers.
rachel_green Oh, right, clink.
michael Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
rachel_green Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
michael Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
rachel_green I mean he just started going out with her.
michael Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
rachel_green Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
michael Alright.
rachel_green OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
phoebe_buffay So, I figured it out.
joey_tribbiani What?
phoebe_buffay Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
joey_tribbiani Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
phoebe_buffay Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
joey_tribbiani Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
phoebe_buffay You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
rachel_green I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a

waiter So, would you like any dessert?
michael No! No dessert, just a check, please.
rachel_green Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
michael No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie
rachel_green Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
michael Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
rachel_green Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
michael Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
rachel_green Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
phone_guy Hang on.
rachel_green Hello, excuse me.
phone_guy What.
rachel_green Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.

michael Good.
rachel_green Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
chandler_bing No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
monica_geller Why not?
chandler_bing Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.

rachel_green I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
dr_ross_geller OK. Oh, oh, oh.

dr_ross_geller You've had feelings for me?
rachel_green Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
dr_ross_geller Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
rachel_green Chandler told me.
dr_ross_geller Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
rachel_green When you were in China.
dr_ross_geller China.
rachel_green Meeting Julie.
dr_ross_geller Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
rachel_green Are you over me?
dr_ross_geller That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
julie Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
dr_ross_geller I'll be right down.
rachel_green Wait, so, you're going?
dr_ross_geller Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
rachel_green OK, OK.
dr_ross_geller Cat.
phoebe_buffay Hey Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey Phoebs.
phoebe_buffay How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
joey_tribbiani I can't find the remote. Thank you.
phoebe_buffay So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
joey_tribbiani And?
phoebe_buffay And we did.
joey_tribbiani All right Phoebs, way to go.
phoebe_buffay Yay me.
joey_tribbiani So, so how did it happen?
phoebe_buffay Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
joey_tribbiani And what did he say?
phoebe_buffay He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
joey_tribbiani Wow.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
joey_tribbiani Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
phoebe_buffay Um-hum.
joey_tribbiani This man is my God.
rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller I didn't get a cat.
rachel_green Oh, that's um, interesting.
dr_ross_geller No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
rachel_green Alright, I got it Ross.
dr_ross_geller You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
rachel_green Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
dr_ross_geller Then you should have said something before I met her.
rachel_green I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
dr_ross_geller There was never a good time.
rachel_green Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
dr_ross_geller Not, not, not
rachel_green Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
dr_ross_geller The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
rachel_green Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
rachel_green Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
dr_ross_geller Fine.
rachel_green 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
dr_ross_geller Good.
rachel_green Good.
dr_ross_geller Try the bottom one.
chandler_bing Monica, it's 6
monica_geller No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
chandler_bing OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
monica_geller Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
chandler_bing Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
monica_geller Well, thanks.
chandler_bing I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
monica_geller Well, you know.
chandler_bing You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
monica_geller Uh-huh.
chandler_bing And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
monica_geller Well no, but um.
chandler_bing I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
monica_geller Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
chandler_bing So, you feel like goin' for a run?
monica_geller Alright.
chandler_bing Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
monica_geller OK. Just for a little while.
chandler_bing OK.
