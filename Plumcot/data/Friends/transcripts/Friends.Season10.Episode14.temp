mike Thank you guys for having us over.
phoebe Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
chandler Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
monica Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
chandler You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
ross Hey, you guys... I have great news.
monica Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
ross Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
chandler A dinosaur died a million years ago?
ross Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
phoebe Wow!
ross Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
rachel Hi you guys.
all Hey.
rachel Ooh, Italian!
monica No one wanted seconds, right?
ross No, no. I-I'm good.
rachel Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
ross I'm up for tenure.
rachel Congratulations!
ross You too! What are the odds?
rachel Ooh!
joey Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
monica I don't know who I'm happiest for...
phoebe I do, he's been working on that all day!
phoebe Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
monica No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
phoebe Where did you go to do it?
monica Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
chandler YOU NEVER DID IT!
monica I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
chandler Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
mike Here you go.
phoebe Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
mike Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
phoebe All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
chandler Mrs Hannigan?
phoebe What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
joey Hey guys.
chandler Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
joey No, thank you.
monica All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
chandler Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
joey But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
monica Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
joey You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
chandler Damn it.
monica See you guys later.
phoebe Okay!
monica I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
phoebe Good for you. That was really mature.
joey What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
mike You're a strange kind of grown-up.
phoebe Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
mike Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
phoebe All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
joey Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
joey I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
rachel Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
maitre_d Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
rachel Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
maitre_d I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
rachel But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
maitre_d I know. With Gukki
rachel Sssshhhh!
mr_zellner Rachel?
rachel Hi... I'm on a date...
mr_zellner That's great!
rachel Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
mr_zellner Well, you got uhm... good energy.
rachel Oh.
mr_campbell Rachel?
rachel Yes, hi!
mr_campbell James Campbell...
rachel Hi! Excuse us.
mr_campbell Please...
rachel Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
mr_campbell So... your resumÃ© is quite impressive.
rachel Wha... My resumÃ©? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumÃ©.
mr_campbell Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumÃ©.
rachel Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
mr_campbell Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
rachel What? I-I don't.
mr_campbell You don't?
rachel No, I-I-I love it there.
mr_campbell Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
mr_campbell What?
mr_campbell That's Hugo Boss?
phoebe This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
clerk How can I help you?
phoebe I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
clerk You need to fill out this form.
phoebe Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
clerk It can be anything you want.
phoebe Well, not anything, I mean...
clerk Yeah... anything.
phoebe Oh, this could take a while.
clerk Get out of my line.
phoebe Okay.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey Pheebs.
phoebe Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
monica Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
phoebe Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
chandler That's what we were gonna name the baby.
monica Phoebe!
phoebe Uh! Princess Consuela.
monica You seriously changed your name to that?
phoebe Uh-huh!
monica Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
phoebe Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
chandler Hey, how'd the interview go?
rachel Oh! It's not good.
chandler You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
rachel Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
chandler That is a bad interview.
phoebe What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
rachel Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
monica Oh God. I'm so sorry.
ross Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
phoebe Ross...
ross I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
all_ Congratulations!
ross This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
gunther Six? You want me to join you?
ross Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
chandler Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
ross I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
rachel Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
ross Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
phoebe Can you?
rachel Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
ross And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
phoebe And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
ross But also knowing it means a lot.
monica But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
ross ...that center around work.
chandler To Ross!
all_ Ross!
ross You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
phoebe Oh God!
ross No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
rachel No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
ross Rach, I'm so sorry.
rachel Oh!
ross Great. I feel like an idiot.
rachel No, it's okay, you didn't know.
ross Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
monica Thank you for letting us see the house again.
chandler And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
realtor Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
monica Ah, so glad you decided to come.
joey Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
chandler What?
joey Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
monica No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
joey Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
monica Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
joey Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
monica No it's not!
joey Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
chandler When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
joey Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
monica Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
joey FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
monica Joey, we know that's you.
joey no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm

joey Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
girl I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
joey Oh.
mackenzie I hate my parents.
joey I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
mackenzie Like what?
joey Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
mackenzie What are you? Eight?
joey Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
mackenzie I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
joey Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
mackenzie I really don't.
joey What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
mackenzie My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
joey Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
mackenzie This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
joey Yeah, yeah, I guess.
mackenzie Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
joey Yeah, maybe.
mackenzie Then you gotta let them go.
joey I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
mackenzie I read a lot.
joey Just when I thought we could be friends.
man Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
rachel Oh, thank you...
man You still don't know my name, do you?
rachel Well, now I don't have to.
rachel Ross, what is taking you so long?
ross I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
mark Rachel?
rachel Mark? Oh my God!
mark How've you been?
rachel I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
mark Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
ross Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
mark Clever. So how are you?
rachel Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
mark Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
rachel No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
mark Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
rachel Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
mark Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
rachel Great! I'll call ya!
mark Nice to see you.
ross Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
rachel Oh my God!
ross See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
rachel Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
ross That is Mark?
rachel Yes.
ross I hate that guy.
rachel Oh.
ross No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
rachel What? You don't want me to get a job?
ross Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
rachel Ugh.
ross I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
rachel Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
monica Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
chandler Man, those two dogs are going at it!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey.
monica Hey, where have you been?
joey Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
chandler Really? What changed your mind?
joey Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
chandler Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
joey What?
chandler Ha! I'm just messing with you.
joey That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
monica Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
joey What? I get my own room?
chandler You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
joey Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
chandler_and_monica No!
joey Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
mike After you, miss Banana Hammock.
phoebe Thank you, mister Bag.

phoebe Er, Rita, this is my husband.
rita Oh!
phoebe Yeah.
mike Why don't you tell her my name?
phoebe Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
rita Crap Bag?
mike If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
rita Okay. Excuse me...
phoebe Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
mike Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
mike Really?
phoebe Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
mike Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
phoebe It's a funny word.
mike It's a Speedo.
phoebe ...Oh crap!
ross Hey, is Rachel here?
monica No.
ross She's still at dinner?
monica I guess. Why? Who's she with?
ross That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
chandler It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
ross We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
monica So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
chandler Excuse me?
monica Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
chandler For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
monica Oh, sorry!
rachel Hi you guys!
ross Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
rachel Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
ross Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
rachel Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
ross Should we send something?
chandler How did the job stuff go?
rachel He offered me one.
chandler That's great!
ross Congratulations!
rachel I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
ross Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
rachel The job is in Paris.
joey I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
mackenzie I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.
joey Hey bear, I need some career advice.
