rachel I know!
joey Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
rachel Wh-what?!
joey I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
rachel Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
phoebe Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
rachel Yeah.
phoebe You wanna work on your interview skills?
rachel O-okay!
phoebe Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
rachel Hi.
phoebe Very good handshake, good wrist action.
monica Let me try.
phoebe Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
monica Did I squeeze it too hard?
phoebe Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
joey That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
monica Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
joey Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
joey Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
monica Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
joey Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor
monica Wow! She is pretty, huh?
joey Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
ross Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
joey This is your place?
ross Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
joey But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
joey Ugh!!
monica What happened?
joey I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
monica No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
garys_radio We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
gary Okay, now I've really have to go!
phoebe But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
gary I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
phoebe Okay, then maybe I can come too!
garys_radio Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
phoebe All right, you go.
gary Bye-bye.
phoebe 'Kay, bye!
phoebe Oh God!
monica What?
phoebe Oh I just miss him so much!
monica Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
phoebe Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
monica I know it is the best.
phoebe So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
monica What? It's still going on.
phoebe Come on, seriously! When did it end?
monica I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
phoebe Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
monica What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
phoebe God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
monica Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
chandler Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
monica You are so cute.
chandler Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
rachel Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
joey Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
rachel No!
chandler So what happened?
rachel Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
joey What happened?
rachel All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh
joey You kissed him?!
rachel Well, I didn't know what else to do!
chandler Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
rachel Thanks Chandler.
monica Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
rachel I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
monica Yes!
joey I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
rachel What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
joey Yeah! No?
monica A kiss? What are you talking about?
rachel I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
chandler Come on, Rach.
rachel Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
monica He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
rachel Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
joey Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
rachel Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
joey No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
chandler I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
joey Damnit!! Did you move?!
ross Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
the_old_man Yes?
joey Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
the_old_man No. I'm all alone.
joey Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?

mr_zelner Here let me
rachel Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
rachel Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
rachel Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
ross You got ink on your lip.
rachel Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
chandler So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
gary I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
chandler Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you
gary Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
monica Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
phoebe Oh we can't, we already have plans.
monica What are you doing?
phoebe Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
monica Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
phoebe You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
monica Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
phoebe Yeah!
monica Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
chandler Uh, yeah.
monica Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
chandler Why?
monica 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
chandler Ohh, so?
monica So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
chandler Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
ross Hey!
the_man Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
ross Who isn't?
ross I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
the_hot_girl I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
ross Nevermind!
the_hot_girl No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
ross I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
the_hot_girl Jen.
ross Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
jen Sure! That would be nice.
ross Umm?
jen Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
ross I will give you a call.
jen I'll see you later.
ross Okay!
jen I forgot my paper.
chandler That was amazing!
monica Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
chandler That was amazing.
monica We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
chandler No, you're the best.
monica No, you're the best.
chandler No, you're the best.
monica I am the best.
joey Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
monica Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
joey I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
monica Why?
joey Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
monica What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
joey No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
monica No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
joey I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
ross So uhh, you ready?
jen Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
ross Sure. Joey
joey Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
rachel Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
mr_zelner That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
rachel Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
mr_zelner Fair enough.
rachel Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr
mr_zelner Zelner.
rachel Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
mr_zelner Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
rachel Oh! You are?
mr_zelner Um-hmm.
rachel Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
mr_zelner Yes!
rachel Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
phoebe You tired Chandler?
monica You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
chandler Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
gary So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
chandler Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
monica Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
phoebe Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
gary Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so
monica You didn't!
phoebe We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
monica The park huh? A public place.
gary Uh-huh.
monica I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
monica Hi Chandler.
chandler Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
monica Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
chandler No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
monica Come on, we can't let them win!
chandler Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
monica Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
chandler So?
monica I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
chandler Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
monica Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
chandler Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
monica Really?
chandler Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
monica That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
chandler Yeah?
monica Yeah.
chandler Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
monica Did not.
chandler Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
monica Okay, I freaked out a little.
chandler Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
rachel I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
monica Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
chandler You guys ready fore the movies?
rachel Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
ross Man! They cannot get enough!
