phoebe_buffay What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
dr_ross_geller oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
phoebe_buffay WHAT!
dr_ross_geller umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
phoebe_buffay WHAT! WHY?
dr_ross_geller well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
phoebe_buffay If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
dr_ross_geller well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah.
phoebe_buffay I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
dr_ross_geller Good yeah just be honest with him.
phoebe_buffay yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
dr_ross_geller I'll get it
phoebe_buffay ok
mike_hannigan You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?
phoebe_buffay Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
hayley so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.
joey_tribbiani Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
hayley What?
joey_tribbiani How could you not remember that we slept together?
hayley What! When?
joey_tribbiani I dunno!
hayley I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
joey_tribbiani come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
hayley no it's not ringing any bells.
joey_tribbiani my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
hayleys_roommate#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode04 Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
joey_tribbiani Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
phoebe_buffay and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
mike_hannigan But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
phoebe_buffay yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
mike_hannigan that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
phoebe_buffay I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
mike_hannigan I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
mike_hannigan and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
phoebe_buffay ok I can't do this.
mike_hannigan what's wrong?
phoebe_buffay well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me.
mike_hannigan uh huh
phoebe_buffay so you don't think I'm a total freak
mike_hannigan No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
phoebe_buffay I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
mike_hannigan Definitely
dr_ross_geller This is Vicrum.
chandler_bing Hi honey I'm home!
monica_geller : Hi, how was your flight?
chandler_bing oh it was great.
monica_geller : Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you.
chandler_bing well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
monica_geller : Ok This is how much I love you.
chandler_bing Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
monica_geller : Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
chandler_bing no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
monica_geller : Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
chandler_bing does what always have to be sharks.
monica_geller : Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
chandler_bing What's going on?
monica_geller : sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
chandler_bing let ME be a part of this!
monica_geller : I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
chandler_bing no they don't
monica_geller : then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
chandler_bing OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn
monica_geller : really?
chandler_bing yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
monica_geller : I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
chandler_bing You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
monica_geller : Im very, very drunk right now.
joey_tribbiani see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
phoebe_buffay you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
joey_tribbiani your right! I love my life! I actually did sleep with her.
