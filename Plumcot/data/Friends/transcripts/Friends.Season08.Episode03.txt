monica_geller That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
chandler_bing I'd better go pack.
monica_geller Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
chandler_bing A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
rachel_green Oh good you're still here!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
monica_geller Thank you.
rachel_green And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
joey_tribbiani We know its Ross!
rachel_green How?! How do you know?
phoebe_buffay It was his sweater, but-Oh my God!
rachel_green Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
monica_geller This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
rachel_green I know!
phoebe_buffay Me too!
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
rachel_green You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
monica_geller Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
rachel_green Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
monica_geller Well, what were you gonna say?
rachel_green Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
joey_tribbiani Well that, that sounds good.
rachel_green Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
monica_geller Hey! Good luck!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, bye.
joey_tribbiani Bye.
chandler_bing Hey, what was that all about?
monica_geller Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
chandler_bing What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
monica_geller I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
chandler_bing What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
joey_tribbiani What secrets?
chandler_bing Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
joey_tribbiani You'll tell me later?
chandler_bing You already know.
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
phoebe_buffay All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
joey_tribbiani I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
phoebe_buffay What?! They took mine to give to you!
joey_tribbiani Why would they take away our keys?
phoebe_buffay Maybe they don't trust us.
joey_tribbiani No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
phoebe_buffay You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I washed those!
phoebe_buffay No you didn't.
joey_tribbiani Yeah that didn't sound like me.
phoebe_buffay Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
phoebe_buffay What stuff?
joey_tribbiani Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Did Rachel find you?
dr_ross_geller No why?
phoebe_buffay Oh she was looking for you.
dr_ross_geller Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
phoebe_buffay Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
dr_ross_geller Oh no.
phoebe_buffay What?
dr_ross_geller I think I might know what this is about.
joey_tribbiani Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
phoebe_buffay And?
dr_ross_geller Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
phoebe_buffay Oh sorry. And?!
dr_ross_geller Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
dr_ross_geller Why? What-what else could it be?
joey_tribbiani Oh wow, I don't feel well.
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
phoebe_buffay Maybe it's something you ate?
joey_tribbiani Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.

joey_tribbiani What the hell is that?
joey_tribbiani Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
mr_treeger You said there was a gas leak in here.
phoebe_buffay Well why don't you use your key?
mr_treeger Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up.
phoebe_buffay Oh! We could have done that.
monica_geller Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
chandler_bing No.

chandler_bing Shh! Nice to see you again.
the_airline_employee Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
chandler_bing Yes, of course.
the_airline_employee I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.
chandler_bing Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
the_airline_employee Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Apology accepted. Excuse us.

monica_geller Fine. Go! Go! Go!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
dr_ross_geller I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here.
rachel_green You do?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
rachel_green Seriously. What?!
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
rachel_green Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
dr_ross_geller Oh sure.
rachel_green I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that
rachel_green Can I get you some water?
dr_ross_geller I'm good. I'm good.
rachel_green Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I need uh... I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
rachel_green I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
dr_ross_geller What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
rachel_green They do!
dr_ross_geller No they don't!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
rachel_green Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
dr_ross_geller Oh well I may as well have!
rachel_green Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out
dr_ross_geller Freaked out? Hey no, I'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
rachel_green Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
dr_ross_geller No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
rachel_green Okay, y'know maybe I should come back
dr_ross_geller Shh! Shh! Shh!
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Yeah I'll press 1!
mr_treeger I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
joey_tribbiani Huh. So then I can heat this up?
mr_treeger Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
phoebe_buffay Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
mr_treeger Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
phoebe_buffay Oh no.
mr_treeger Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
mr_treeger Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
dr_ross_geller Sure.
mr_treeger Namaste.
dr_ross_geller Namaste.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
joey_tribbiani So it's noticeable huh?
dr_ross_geller Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
phoebe_buffay Didn't you two already talk?
dr_ross_geller Yeah but uh... Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else. Rachel's pregnant.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
phoebe_buffay Holy mother of God!!!
dr_ross_geller With my child.
phoebe_buffay That is brand new information!!
dr_ross_geller You already know don't you?
phoebe_buffay A little bit.
joey_tribbiani How are you doing?
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
joey_tribbiani Well, what did you say to her?
dr_ross_geller Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
phoebe_buffay Oh Ross.
dr_ross_geller But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller I gotta go find her.
joey_tribbiani Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
dr_ross_geller Evidently they do.
joey_tribbiani What?!
monica_geller I can't believe we're here.
chandler_bing Oh you've got to be kidding me.
monica_geller What?
the_front_desk_clerk As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
monica_geller No!! You have been screwing us all day!
man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode03 Who are you?
chandler_bing We're you just ten seconds later!
monica_geller Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
the_woman Well you can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay. We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
chandler_bing We need the stuff.
joey_tribbiani Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
monica_geller What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
chandler_bing What else is new?
joey_tribbiani Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
monica_geller Well do something! Get in there!
joey_tribbiani How? I guess I could break down your door.
monica_geller Yeah! Do that!
joey_tribbiani And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
monica_geller No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
joey_tribbiani Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down.
phoebe_buffay Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
the_nurse Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
rachel_green If I said I was, would you judge me?
the_nurse The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
rachel_green Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Uh we-we need to talk.
rachel_green Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
dr_ross_geller Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
rachel_green Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
dr_ross_geller What? Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really-I should have been thinking about you Rach
rachel_green Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
dr_ross_geller Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
rachel_green What married?
dr_ross_geller Well yeah, I think we should get married.
rachel_green What, because that's your answer to everything?
dr_ross_geller No, because that's the right thing to do.
rachel_green Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
dr_ross_geller No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
rachel_green Excuse me?
dr_ross_geller Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
rachel_green I can too eat by myself!
dr_ross_geller When have you ever?
rachel_green When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
dr_ross_geller Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
rachel_green Oh please, you inhale your food!
dr_ross_geller I grew up with Monica! If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
dr_long Am I interrupting?
rachel_green Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
dr_ross_geller But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
dr_long Huh. Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
dr_ross_geller I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
rachel_green I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
dr_long Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God.
rachel_green Wow. There it is, I see it.
dr_long Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Pretty amazing huh?
rachel_green I don't see it!
dr_ross_geller What? What?!
rachel_green I can't see it!
dr_ross_geller You-you just said that you did!
rachel_green I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
dr_ross_geller Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it's-it's-it's, it's right there
rachel_green Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.

dr_ross_geller Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Sweetie that's it.
rachel_green That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
dr_ross_geller You're welcome.

phoebe_buffay Oh.
joey_tribbiani I don't see the baby. Where is it?
rachel_green Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again.
dr_ross_geller Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
