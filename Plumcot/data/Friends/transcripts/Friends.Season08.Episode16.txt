joey_tribbiani There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, he's the best.
dr_ross_geller Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
joey_tribbiani I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
dr_ross_geller Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
joey_tribbiani It's Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
joey_tribbiani Yes.
dr_ross_geller Um, you...you like Rachel?
joey_tribbiani Yes. I like Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Rachel?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
dr_ross_geller But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but it's not a big deal.
dr_ross_geller It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?
joey_tribbiani I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
dr_ross_geller Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?
joey_tribbiani Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I-I gotta go.
joey_tribbiani Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't
dr_ross_geller I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
gunther Rachel?!!
rachel_green Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
chandler_bing Oh! She's growing inside you.
rachel_green Whoa!!
chandler_bing Oh!
rachel_green Wow that was a big one.
chandler_bing I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
phoebe_buffay Oh hey you guys!
chandler_bing Oh hey!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
rachel_green Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, and you?
chandler_bing No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
phoebe_buffay Okay, good.
chandler_bing Why?
phoebe_buffay Well last night, I met Monica's.
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
chandler_bing Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?
rachel_green Well, what's he like?!
phoebe_buffay Well he's tall.
rachel_green Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay He has brown hair.
rachel_green Of course, of course.
chandler_bing A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
phoebe_buffay He works with food!
rachel_green Oh sure. Older?
phoebe_buffay Obviously, and he's British.
rachel_green Oh, I was just gonna ask!
phoebe_buffay Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
rachel_green Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
chandler_bing Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
chandler_bing You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
phoebe_buffay Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
dr_ross_geller Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
monica_geller All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.
monica_geller Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
dr_ross_geller Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
monica_geller Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
dr_ross_geller He's not?
monica_geller No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
dr_ross_geller Why?
monica_geller He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
dr_ross_geller Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
monica_geller Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.
monica_geller All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Hi!
monica_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
don Oh, hello. Hello.
phoebe_buffay Soul mate.
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay Soul mate.
monica_geller So, what have you guys been doing?
don Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
monica_geller I know! What is this, 1985?!
don That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
monica_geller Not really.
chandler_bing What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
monica_geller So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
don Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
monica_geller Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
don You're kidding me!
monica_geller No!
don Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
monica_geller Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
chandler_bing What are you doing?!
phoebe_buffay Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So
chandler_bing I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
phoebe_buffay They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
monica_geller Phoebe, good work.
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
monica_geller Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him.
phoebe_buffay Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
dr_ross_geller No, I don't want to hit you.
joey_tribbiani Oh what then? Kick me?
dr_ross_geller No.
joey_tribbiani Bite me?
dr_ross_geller No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
joey_tribbiani Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
dr_ross_geller Uh...yeah sure.
joey_tribbiani Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
joey_tribbiani Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so
dr_ross_geller What?! You're in love with her.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I thought you knew that.
dr_ross_geller Umm, no.
joey_tribbiani Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
dr_ross_geller I think you need to tell her how you feel.
joey_tribbiani Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
dr_ross_geller No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
joey_tribbiani But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But
dr_ross_geller If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
joey_tribbiani Are you sure?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So
joey_tribbiani Hey thanks.
dr_ross_geller So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
joey_tribbiani Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
dr_ross_geller I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, tell me about it.
don ...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
chandler_bing Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
don Excuse me?
chandler_bing Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
don Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
monica_geller Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
don And you're still married to him?
monica_geller You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
don Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
chandler_bing Is it made of cheese?
don No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
monica_geller I'd move in tomorrow!
chandler_bing Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
phoebe_buffay I'm so sorry.
chandler_bing What do we do?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident.
rachel_green Joey? What's up?
joey_tribbiani I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
rachel_green Okay what's up?
joey_tribbiani Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
rachel_green Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
joey_tribbiani Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
rachel_green Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
joey_tribbiani Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!
monica_geller I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
chandler_bing Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
monica_geller Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
chandler_bing Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
monica_geller Jeez! What is with you?
chandler_bing I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
monica_geller All right, what's going on?
chandler_bing Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
monica_geller Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
chandler_bing No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
monica_geller I don't believe in soul mates either.
chandler_bing You don't?
monica_geller No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
chandler_bing So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
monica_geller No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
chandler_bing I love you.
monica_geller I know.
chandler_bing Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers No? Really? They taste so good.
rachel_green ...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. Are you okay?
joey_tribbiani What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?
rachel_green No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
joey_tribbiani I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
rachel_green Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Sure.
rachel_green Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
joey_tribbiani Uh... How long have we known each other?
rachel_green Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh, long time.
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani But over the past few weeks
the_waiter Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight
joey_tribbiani Actually uh, could you give us a second?
the_waiter Sure. Sure. Second's up! Not...that kind of table.
rachel_green So you were saying?
joey_tribbiani I'm not quite sure.
rachel_green Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.

rachel_green No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
joey_tribbiani Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!
rachel_green Can I?
joey_tribbiani Sure!
rachel_green Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose
