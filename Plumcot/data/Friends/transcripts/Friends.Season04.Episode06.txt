cheryl So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
dr_ross_geller You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
phoebe_buffay Hey what are you guys looking at?
chandler_bing Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, come to papa.
dr_ross_geller I know!
monica_geller Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
chandler_bing Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
rachel_green Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
dr_ross_geller Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
chandler_bing Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
dr_ross_geller I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
rachel_green Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
dr_ross_geller Fine by me; hope she wins.
chandler_bing Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
phoebe_buffay Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
chandler_bing Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
chandler_bing Well, I have a call in about that.
phoebe_buffay 'Kay.
chandler_bing Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
rachel_green Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
chandler_bing Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
rachel_green Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
chandler_bing Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
rachel_green Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
chandler_bing It doesn't say that. Does it?
dr_ross_geller How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
chandler_bing Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
phoebe_buffay It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
monica_geller Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
rachel_green Oh my God! What happened?
monica_geller Sixty guests.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
monica_geller Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
phoebe_buffay Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican....Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
monica_geller I don't know.
phoebe_buffay There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
monica_geller Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
phoebe_buffay Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
monica_geller Well, you're not working either.
phoebe_buffay Yes, but I'm doing this.
monica_geller Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode06 Hey.
kathy Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
joey_tribbiani Why?
joey_tribbiani You can pee here!
kathy Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
chandler_bing It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
joey_tribbiani We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode06 Yeah!
rachel_green Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I know...
rachel_green And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
phoebe_buffay Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
rachel_green No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
phoebe_buffay Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey, how'd it go?
monica_geller Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
phoebe_buffay Mon! I'm so happy for you!
monica_geller Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
phoebe_buffay I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
monica_geller Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
monica_geller Okay.
dr_ross_geller Huh...
cheryl Um, would you like to come in?
dr_ross_geller Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
cheryl According to recent findings!
cheryl Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
dr_ross_geller Mitzi is.....
cheryl My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
dr_ross_geller Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh.do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
cheryl What?
dr_ross_geller Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
cheryl I'd rather not.
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, why not?
cheryl Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
monica_geller Oh, is everything in the car?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Did you settle the bill?
monica_geller No. I hate this part.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look what we almost left.
monica_geller No, that's not mine.
phoebe_buffay Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
monica_geller Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
mrs_burkart Oh, good. Thank you.
monica_geller Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
mrs_burkart Dear?
monica_geller Just the matter of..payment?
mrs_burkart Jack used to handle the finances!
rachel_green You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
chandler_bing Sure...
rachel_green And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
chandler_bing I don't know... um, Grease?
rachel_green No....
chandler_bing Rent?
rachel_green Yes! Rent!
chandler_bing Okay, so when do you want to go?
rachel_green What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
joey_tribbiani Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
chandler_bing Yes, it is, at Office Max.
rachel_green What did you get her?
chandler_bing A pen.
joey_tribbiani It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
chandler_bing Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
chandler_bing Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
rachel_green Okay, honey, what he means by that, is..while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
joey_tribbiani Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
chandler_bing All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
joey_tribbiani She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
chandler_bing For three years?
joey_tribbiani Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
chandler_bing All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
joey_tribbiani Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
chandler_bing Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
joey_tribbiani Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
phoebe_buffay But Mon, you have to get our money!
monica_geller Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
phoebe_buffay I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
monica_geller Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
phoebe_buffay Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
monica_geller Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
mrs_burkart You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
phoebe_buffay She seems fine now.
mrs_burkart ..emblem of the land I love. The home of....
joey_tribbiani So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
dr_ross_geller You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
joey_tribbiani Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
dr_ross_geller What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
joey_tribbiani All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
dr_ross_geller No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
joey_tribbiani What kind of smell?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. Soap?
joey_tribbiani All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani You wanna see her again, right?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, okay you're right.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
joey_tribbiani All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
chandler_bing Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
rachel_green Any luck?
chandler_bing Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
rachel_green All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
chandler_bing She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
rachel_green Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
chandler_bing Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
rachel_green Oh! Pathetic!
joey_tribbiani Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
chandler_bing Where?
joey_tribbiani Our place, the hall! I...
chandler_bing I got something for her. It's a book!
joey_tribbiani A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
chandler_bing No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
joey_tribbiani You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
chandler_bing No, it came out to an even twenty.
joey_tribbiani Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
mrs_burkart Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
phoebe_buffay You didn't get the money, did you?
monica_geller Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
phoebe_buffay No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
mrs_burkart Come on along and listen to...
phoebe_buffay Okay, Widow!
mrs_burkart ..the lullabye of...
phoebe_buffay Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
mrs_burkart All right. I'll get my bag.
phoebe_buffay Good.
monica_geller I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
cheryl So you want to come inside?
dr_ross_geller Yes. Yes I do.
cheryl I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
cheryl Guess who?
dr_ross_geller Department of Sanitation?
cheryl It's me!
dr_ross_geller Oh! Ah. Aw!
cheryl What?
dr_ross_geller Ah, Cheryl!
cheryl Oh, Ross!
cheryl Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
dr_ross_geller Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
cheryl Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
rachel_green I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
gunther Move!
rachel_green Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
phoebe_buffay Uh... yay!
rachel_green Thanks!
monica_geller Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
rachel_green Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
monica_geller Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
monica_geller And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
monica_geller Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
phoebe_buffay Okay!
monica_geller I can cook and you can take care of the money.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
both#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode06 Aah!

chandler_bing Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
kathy You really didn't have to. Wow.
chandler_bing See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
kathy Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah... yeah.
joey_tribbiani Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?

kathy Um, thank you for the gift.
chandler_bing Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
kathy No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
chandler_bing Uh, the book?
kathy The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
chandler_bing What do you mean?
kathy Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
chandler_bing Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
kathy You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
kathy Well....
chandler_bing Goodnight.
joey_tribbiani Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
monica_geller Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
cheryl Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
monica_geller Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
monica_geller No?
