chandler Hey!
monica Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
chandler I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
monica Well, I just lost my erection.
chandler I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
monica You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
chandler But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
monica Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
chandler Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
monica I know!!! My erection is back!
joey Thank you!
phoebe Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
joey Okay.
Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
joeyphoebe I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
joey If you want I could loan you some money?
phoebe Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
joey Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
phoebe You could do that?
joey Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
phoebe Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
joey Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
phoebe Oh, really?
joey No it is awesome!
ross Hi guys.
allphoebe Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
ross Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
joey She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
rachel Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
ross I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
monica Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
chandler How long was I in there?
monica Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
chandler Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
monica Don't you want to look through the rest?
chandler I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
monica You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
chandler I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
monica I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
chandler Honey? Leave it to the pros.
monica I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
chandler "The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
monica "Marriage. It's not for everybody."
rachel That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
ross Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
rachel I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
guy Who the hell are you?
rachel I'm the hell person whose office this is!
ross Good one, Rach.
guy I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.
rachel Excuse me?
gavin Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
phoebe Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
joey Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
phoebe Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
joey Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
director Okay, okay, okay! You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.
phoebe Okay, now. What?
director And...Action!!
director Cut! Cut!
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
director Well, don't be.
phoebe Okay, that helps.
director And...Action!
director Cut!
joey Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.
director And...Action!
interviewer So, do you have any other question about advertising?
chandler No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
interviewer Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.
chandler Really? That's great!
interviewer It's an unpaid internship.
chandler It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
interviewer Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
chandler Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
interviewer Stop!
interviewer Okay.
rachel Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
gavin Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
rachel A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
gavin Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
rachel Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
gavin I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
rachel Excuse me?
ross Rach we have a code brown situation.
rachel Can you please, please take care of it for me?
ross Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
rachel Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
gavin Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
rachel That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
gavin I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
rachel Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
gavin Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
rachel Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
mr_zelner Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
rachel Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.
mr_zelner Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
rachel That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
gavin Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
rachel Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
mr_zelner Incidentally, when are you coming back?
rachel Today.
gavin You said two weeks.
rachel No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
joey Hey.
phoebe Hey. So, what did he say?
joeyphoebe I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
joey That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
phoebe Joey.
joey No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
phoebe Who dies?
joey Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
phoebe Yes, doctor.
joey Okay.
director Okay, let's try this one more time.
phoebe Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
director And...Action!
phoebe Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
director The rest of the scene.
phoebe Okay, from the top, people!
rachel Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
ross What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
rachel Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
ross What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
rachel I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
ross Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
rachel Come on, I don't know what else to do.
ross Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
rachel Ross?
ross Huh?
rachel You're pretty.
chandler Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
ross So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
chandler Yeah.
ross Good-bye.
monica Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
chandler Yeah, Ross is here so...
ross Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
monica We're gonna have sex.
ross I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
monica Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
ross Pants off Bing!
rachel Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?
gavin Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
rachel Hey, they were popular when I left!
gavin Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
rachel Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
gavin That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
rachel Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
gavin Fine.
rachel Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
gavin Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
rachel Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
ross Hey.
chandler Hey.
ross You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
chandler Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
monica Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
ross Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
monica Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
chandler Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
monica What are you talking about?
chandler That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
monica What!? You faked it?
ross You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual
phoebe Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
joey Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
phoebe Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
joey Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
phoebe Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
joey Nice.
phoebe Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
joey No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
phoebe About what?
joey He slept with you and then never called you.
phoebe And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
director Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
man So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
joeydrake I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
director Cut, cut! What are you doing!?
phoebe Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
extra Me too!
another_extra Me too!
joey Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
gavin Wow, you're here already.
rachel Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
gavin How do you fix the chair?
rachel Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
mr_zelner Good, because it's in ten minutes.
rachel What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
mr_zelner Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.
rachel Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
gavin You can do the presentation.
rachel No, I can't, I have a baby.
gavin I'll watch her.
rachel Why would you do that?
gavin Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.
rachel That's really nice.
gavin I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
rachel Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
gavin I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.
joey Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
director Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.
joey Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
joey Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
phoebe I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
joey You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
phoebe Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
joey What?
phoebe Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
joey Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
monica You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
chandler Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
monica Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
chandler That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
monica Like a month?
chandler Or a year?
monica Really, you want to wait a year?
chandler It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
monica I really wanna have a baby.
chandler Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
monica No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
chandler I quit and you learn what I do?
monica It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
chandler I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
monica It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
chandler Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
monica Yes, please!
chandler Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
monica I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
joeydrake I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.
man I'm not your brother.
phoebewaitress What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
