chandler Hey Pheebs, what's up?
phoebe You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
phoebe Oh my God! You're getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
monica Phoebe, I can explain!

rachel Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.
joey Oh, I love you too.
rachel And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had.
joey That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
doctor Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
ross I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!!
rachel Joey! Joey!
joey What? What's going on?
rachel Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
joey Aaaah
rachel Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
joey Really?!
rachel Yes!
joey Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
rachel Oh, okay!
joey Oh my, oh my God!
rachel Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
joey Mia Hamm?
rachel Mia Hamm!
joey Oh that's amazing.
rachel Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
joey Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
chandler Hey babe.
monica Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
chandler Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
monica No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
chandler How about to the street say from the balcony?
monica Why don't we just find a place for it?
chandler Okay. How about in that cabinet?
monica No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
chandler How about the closet by the bathroom?
monica Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?
chandler Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
monica No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
chandler Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
monica Feminine stuff.
chandler Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
monica Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.
chandler Fine.
monica Thank you!
chandler Love you.
phoebe Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!
chandler Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
phoebe Why won't you let me massage you?
monica Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
phoebe Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
monica That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
phoebe I'm curious about the human body.
monica Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
phoebe But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
monica Okay, if it means that much to you
phoebe It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
monica Dinosaurs.
phoebe Potato, potaato.
ross Hey!
joey Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
ross What?! It is?!
rachel It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
ross Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
rachel Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping
joey A dreamless sleep.
ross My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I...kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
joey Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
ross Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
joey Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
phoebe Are you under the sheet?
monica Yes.
phoebe Great, let's begin. How's the pressure?
monica Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
phoebe Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
monica No. Ooohh
phoebe That's right, you just enjoy.
monica Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
phoebe Okay.
monica Oh God Phoebe!! Oh that's it! That's it! Right there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh
chandler I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!
joey Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
chandler Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
joey Why not?
chandler I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
joey I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
chandler Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
joey Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
chandler And here we go
joey I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!
rachel Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
joey Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
rachel Really?
joey Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
rachel Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!
joey Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!
joey Hey! So?
dr_long She's fine. She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
rachel Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
joey So but everything is normal.
dr_long Absolutely.
joey And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
dr_long No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are, but she's fine.
rachel Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
joey Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
rachel But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
joey Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
rachel But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
joey You sure?!
rachel Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?
joey Oh hey-hey!
ross Is everything okay?
rachel Yeah, everything's fine!
ross Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
joey Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
ross Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
rachel Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
joey Hey uh, what's with the candy?
ross Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
rachel Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
ross No I-Mona!
rachel Oh, I gotta go back in there.
ross What? Why? What's wrong?
rachel No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back
ross No really, you tell me what's up.
rachel I-I forgot my underwear.
ross So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
joey Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
ross Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me. I'm the dad.
dr_long Uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on Braxton-Hicks. Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You're gonna make a wonderful father.
joey Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
chandler There has got to be a way!
joey Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
chandler Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
joey Then why do you throw like one?
chandler Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
joey Sure. "Monica."
chandler So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
joey Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
chandler That's a good idea.
joey Yeah.
chandler Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
joey Oh, I just...I feel terrible.
chandler Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
monica Hey.
phoebe Hey.
monica I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
phoebe No-no, I got that.
monica So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
phoebe Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
monica Okay.
phoebe I mean $500.
monica What?
phoebe 600.
monica What's going on?
phoebe Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
monica What?
phoebe Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
monica What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
phoebe Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
monica Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!
phoebe No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
monica Really?!
phoebe Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
monica Are you sure?
phoebe Yes.
monica I guess.
phoebe Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
rachel Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
ross Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
rachel Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
ross Well yeah!
rachel Oh Ross!!
ross What?! What?! Rach what?!
joey What's going on?
ross I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
joey Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
ross I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
rachel Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
joey I'm on it!
ross I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
joey Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
ross Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
rachel Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
joey Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
ross Yeah.
rachel What's up?
joey Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
rachel Are you breaking up with us?
joey The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So
rachel Yeah?
joey Maybe you two should live together.
rachel Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
joey Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that...if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father.
rachel But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.
ross No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
rachel But Ross, its you and me!
ross So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
joey All right now, so? What do you think?
rachel I don't know. Is it crazy?
ross No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
joey Well, I was due.
rachel Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
ross Really?
rachel Yeah.
ross Oh Rach that's great. That's great.
chandler Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
monica How did you get in there?!
chandler You're messy.
monica Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
chandler I married Fred Sanford!
monica No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.
chandler No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
monica Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?
chandler Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
monica Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
chandler Hey.
joey Hey.
chandler So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
joey Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
chandler Are you okay?
joey Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
monica Ohhh.
phoebe That's it. Just relax.
monica Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
phoebe Come on more!
monica Oh God!
phoebe Yeah, you like that don't you?
monica Oh yeah right there!
phoebe You want it there? You take it there baby!
monica Uh Phoebe?
phoebe Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
