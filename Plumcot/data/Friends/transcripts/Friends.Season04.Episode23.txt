monica_geller Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
chandler_bing Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
monica_geller Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
rachel_green Who are you saying "check" too?
monica_geller Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.

dr_ross_geller Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
rachel_green Oh, I know.
dr_ross_geller So-so come! Why don't you come?
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
rachel_green Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
rachel_green Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
dr_ross_geller This is my wedding.
monica_geller All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
dr_ross_geller Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
chandler_bing Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
dr_ross_geller All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
joey_tribbiani Bye, Pheebs!
joey_tribbiani London baby!!
phoebe_buffay Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
joey_tribbiani Come on! Do something!
chandler_bing I am, I'm ignoring you.
joey_tribbiani Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
chandler_bing Oh, what the hell is that?
joey_tribbiani It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
chandler_bing Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
joey_tribbiani I got it! Here we go.
chandler_bing Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
joey_tribbiani Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
emily_waltham ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be
dr_ross_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
emily_waltham Well, up yours too!
dr_ross_geller What?! No! No! That's-that's time-out!
emily_waltham Sorry.
dr_ross_geller Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
monica_geller Chicken Kiev?
dr_ross_geller Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
monica_geller Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
emily_waltham I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
monica_geller It's nice.
emily_waltham Oh. Oh.
emily_waltham Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
dr_ross_geller It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
emily_waltham How's it gonna be all right?!
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh, I see that.
monica_geller Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
dr_ross_geller What? What?
monica_geller They torn it down a few days early.
joey_tribbiani All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
chandler_bing I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
joey_tribbiani Really? To what?
chandler_bing To Put the Camera Away!!!
joey_tribbiani Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Oh.
rachel_green Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
phoebe_buffay Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
rachel_green Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I have a wedgie.
rachel_green Okay, that is all you.
phoebe_buffay So-so, what do you want for lunch?
rachel_green Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
rachel_green I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
phoebe_buffay Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married
rachel_green Still in love with?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green I'm not in love with Ross!
phoebe_buffay Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
rachel_green Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
phoebe_buffay We thought you knew!
rachel_green We?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
rachel_green You all know? Does Ross know?
phoebe_buffay Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
rachel_green Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
phoebe_buffay Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."
joey_tribbiani Hey!
the_vendor So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
joey_tribbiani Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
chandler_bing Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
joey_tribbiani Well, I like it. Here you go.
chandler_bing All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I embarrass you?
chandler_bing How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
the_vendor He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
chandler_bing Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
the_vendor They're all tourists.
chandler_bing All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
the_vendor Good choice.
joey_tribbiani Thanks.
chandler_bing Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
emily_waltham Hello?
dr_ross_geller Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
emily_waltham We don't have to.
dr_ross_geller Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
emily_waltham No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
dr_ross_geller She said what?
emily_waltham She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
dr_ross_geller Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
emily_waltham I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
dr_ross_geller I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
emily_waltham Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
dr_ross_geller The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
emily_waltham So what are you saying? It's now or never?
dr_ross_geller No. I'm saying it's now.
emily_waltham Or?
dr_ross_geller There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
emily_waltham It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
dr_ross_geller No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hi.
phoebe_buffay So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
rachel_green Manhattan does not have enough stores.
phoebe_buffay Well, I think I can help you get over him.
rachel_green You can?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
rachel_green Um-hmm.
phoebe_buffay And a small piece of chocolate.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay And a glass of tepid water.
rachel_green Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
phoebe_buffay Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
rachel_green I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
rachel_green I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
phoebe_buffay Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay?
rachel_green All right.
phoebe_buffay So uh, now look at the picture
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay All right, and umm
rachel_green Ow!
phoebe_buffay Okay, how do you feel now?
rachel_green Well, I like you less!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Sorry!
chandler_bing No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
joey_tribbiani Me too.
chandler_bing Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Sh-shh-shh!
joey_tribbiani Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
fergie#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
joey_tribbiani Oh, Chandler.
fergie#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Hi Chandler!
chandler_bing That's... That's was
monica_geller Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani That's Fergie baby!!
fergie#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
chandler_bing How did you? How? How?
joey_tribbiani Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
monica_geller Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
dr_ross_geller Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
monica_geller Umm
chandler_bing I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
joey_tribbiani Wait up!
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
monica_geller She said that?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Why?!
dr_ross_geller I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
monica_geller Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
dr_ross_geller Excuse me?
monica_geller Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. A month?
monica_geller Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
dr_ross_geller I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
monica_geller Sometimes we were.
dr_ross_geller Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
monica_geller Okay.
dr_ross_geller Come on.
chandler_bing That was pretty intense huh?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
chandler_bing I hope he did!
phoebe_buffay Hello.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
joey_tribbiani That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
phoebe_buffay Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
joey_tribbiani Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
phoebe_buffay So you're not homesick yet?
joey_tribbiani No, I don't think so.
phoebe_buffay All right, the seven of us miss you.
joey_tribbiani Who's seven?
phoebe_buffay Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies
joey_tribbiani Ahh, the babies miss me?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
joey_tribbiani What? You ordered pizza without me?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
joey_tribbiani Two pizzas?!
phoebe_buffay Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
joey_tribbiani Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
emily_waltham Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
monica_geller You'll see.
emily_waltham I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
emily_waltham Oh God.
dr_ross_geller Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
monica_geller And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
dr_ross_geller But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
emily_waltham It's perfect.
dr_ross_geller And, I don't know, if it starts to rain
emily_waltham Well then we'll get wet.
monica_geller Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
rachel_green Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
rachel_green Do you remember where the duck food is?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
rachel_green Because I'm going to London.
phoebe_buffay What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
rachel_green Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
phoebe_buffay I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
rachel_green Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
phoebe_buffay That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
rachel_green Ohh-Do you think he will?!
phoebe_buffay No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
rachel_green Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
phoebe_buffay I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 The Waltham Residence.
phoebe_buffay Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
phoebe_buffay This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
phoebe_buffay No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
phoebe_buffay Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Hangs up.
phoebe_buffay Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.

rachel_green Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
dr_ross_geller Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
mr_waltham#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
dr_ross_geller I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
mrs_waltham#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
mr_waltham#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
rachel_green Hi, Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
rachel_green Bye, Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
chandler_bing I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
mrs_waltham#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Hello, Waltham Interiors.
