rachel Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
monica Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
rachel Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
monica Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
rachel Oh. Right...Oh great.
monica What is it?
rachel Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
monica Barry who you almost...?
rachel Barry who I almost.
monica And Mindy, your maid of...?
rachel Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
monica That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
ross Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
rachel What?
ross Hi.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
ross Really.
rachel No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
ross Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
rachel Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
ross Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
rachel Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
ross Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
monica Hi.
ross ..Gets interrupted. Hi!
rachel Hi, how was the movie?
monica Wonderful!
phoebe So good!
joey Suck-fest.
chandler Toootal chick-flick.
phoebe I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
joey Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
monica There was nudity!
joey I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
monica_and_phoebe Hugh! Hugh Grant!
ross Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
chandler They're still just friends, right?
rachel And I will see you tomorrow!
ross That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
monica Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
ross 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
chandler I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
joey I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
chandler I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
ross I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
joey She really said that?
ross Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
joey 'Tonight' tonight?
ross Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
chandler I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
ross Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
chandler Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
rachel Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
joey How could you lose him?
rachel I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
monica Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
rachel I don't know. The left one.
monica Which ones?
rachel Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
phoebe Hey.
all Hi.
phoebe Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
chandler Rachel lost Marcel.
phoebe Oh no, how?
monica He- he pooped in my shoe.
phoebe Which one?
monica Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
phoebe No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
rachel C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
joey Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
chandler Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
rachel Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
monica Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
rachel Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
monica Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
rachel Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
mr_heckles Whaddyou want?
monica Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
mr_heckles I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
monica No!
phoebe Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
mr_heckles I wasn't ready for it.
monica A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
mr_heckles Saw Regis Philbin once...
phoebe Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
mr_heckles You owe me a waffle.
rachel Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face....with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
ross Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
rachel Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
ross Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
rachel Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
ross Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
rachel Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
ross Okay, quick and painful.
rachel Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
ross Oh, what? What-what?
rachel Y'know Marcel?
ross ..Yeah?
rachel Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
ross I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
rachel I know, I know, I'm sorry-
ross No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
rachel Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
intercom Animal Control.
rachel See? I've even called Animal Control!
ross You called Animal Control?
rachel Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
ross Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
rachel O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
ross That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
rachel Hi, thanks for coming.
luisa Somebody called about a monkey?
rachel Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
ross Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
rachel Turned out it was a hat.
ross Cat!
rachel Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
monica Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
luisa Marcel?
ross My uncle Marcel.
phoebe Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
luisa Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
phoebe Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
monica Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
phoebe Yes, but there isn't always time!
monica Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
luisa Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
rachel Yeah!
luisa Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
rachel Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
monica The Luisa from home room!
rachel Yes!!
luisa You have no idea who I am, do you.
monica No, none at all.
rachel None.
luisa Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
monica Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
luisa Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
rachel What?!
monica Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
luisa I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
phoebe Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
chandler Marcel?
joey Marcel?
chandler Marcel?
joey Marcel?
woman_no_1 Hi, can I help you?
chandler Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
joey A monkey.
chandler Yes have you seen any?
woman_no_1 No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
joey Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
woman_no_1 Of course.
joey Oh. Then, no.
woman_no_2 Did I put too much rum in here?
woman_no_1 Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
chandler Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
joey Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
chandler Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
joey We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
chandler Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
joey Marcel?
chandler Marcel?!
phoebe Marcel?
monica Marcel?
phoebe Marcel?
both Marcel?
phoebe Oh-my-God!
monica Whaaat!
phoebe Something just brushed up against my right leg!
monica What is it?
phoebe Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
monica Look, Phoebe!
phoebe Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
luisa Step aside, ladies!
monica What're you gonna do?
luisa Just a small tranquiliser.
monica Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
phoebe Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
monica Oh gosh.
ross Marcel?
rachel Marcel?
ross Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
rachel Ross, you don't know that.
ross Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
rachel Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
ross Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
rachel Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
ross Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
rachel Ross.
ross I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
rachel Ross.
ross Oh, forget it, okay?
rachel Ross!
ross What? What?
both Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
phoebe Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
ross Hi, did you order some bananas?
mr_heckles What about it?
ross Gimme back my monkey.
mr_heckles I don't have a monkey.
rachel Then what's with all the bananas?
mr_heckles Potassium.
ross Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
ross Marcel! What've you done to him?
mr_heckles That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
ross Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
mr_heckles C'mere, Patti.
ross C'mere, Marcel.
mr_heckles C'mere, Patti.
luisa Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
ross Okay, gimme my monkey back.
mr_heckles That's my monkey.
luisa You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
mr_heckles That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
ross Alright, I want my monkey.
luisa No!
rachel Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
luisa Sorry, prom queen.
ross You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
rachel Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
luisa Nope.
rachel Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
ross It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
rachel Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
ross Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
rachel Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
ross Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
rachel That'd be good.
ross Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
barry Rachel.
rachel Barry?!
barry I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
ross_and_rachel Oh!
ross We have got to start locking that door!
monica This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
phoebe Nope.
monica That's because I'm in front of them.
chandler Eh. I thought that was an alp.
monica Well, high school was not my favourite time.
joey I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
chandler Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
monica Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
phoebe Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
