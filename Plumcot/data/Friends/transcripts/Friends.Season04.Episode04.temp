phoebe Hey! New wallet, huh?
chandler Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
monica Rachel!
rachel What?
monica You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
rachel Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
monica Have you ever taken out the trash?
rachel Well, I thought you liked doing it.
monica Third door on the left.
rachel Right!
rachel Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
mr_treeger : Hey.
mr_treeger : What are you doing?
rachel Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but
mr_treeger : No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
rachel I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
mr_treeger : Oh yeah, of course you don't!
rachel No.
mr_treeger : 'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
rachel I didn't... I never said that.
mr_treeger : You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
rachel Okay, I'm sorry.
monica God! If you're gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
joey Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
rachel Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
joey I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
monica Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
rachel That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
joey All right that's it, school is in session!
monica My God! Is this a gym card?
chandler Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
ross So why don't you quit?
chandler You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
ross Who is Maria?
chandler Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
ross You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
chandler No!
ross So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
chandler Oh no, you'll have to come.
mr_treeger : Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
joey Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
mr_treeger : And tell him what?
joey Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
mr_treeger : Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
joey I have actually not heard of that.
mr_treeger : Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
joey Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
phoebe Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
monica What's the matter?
phoebe Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
monica So do them for free.
phoebe Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
ross They make you take an oath?
phoebe No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
chandler Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
phoebe No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
rachel Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
monica Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
chandler Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
monica You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
phoebe I don't what your talking about.
ross Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
phoebe Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
rachel Oh! My hero! What happened?
joey Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
monica What a minute, what did he say?
joey He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
rachel What?! You got us evicted!!
monica I told you not to go down there!
joey Well he made Rachel cry!
monica Rachel always cries!
rachel That's not true!
monica Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
joey All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
rachel Go!!
joey All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
ross Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
chandler Yes. Yes!
ross One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
chandler No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
ross Good! That's good!
chandler Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
gym_employee You wanna quit?
chandler I wanna quit the gym.
gym_employee You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
chandler I wanna quit the gym.
gym_employee Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
ross Me? No.
gym_employee Sorry, members only.
chandler I wanna quit the gym.
ross It's okay man, be strong.
gym_employee So, are you a member of any gym.
ross No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
gym_employee Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
woman Hi, I'm Maria.
rick Wow, you have really pretty feet.
phoebe These old things.
rick Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
phoebe You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
rick Yeah.
phoebe Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
rick Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
phoebe Oh.
rick Ow! Did you just bite me?
phoebe No!
mr_treeger : What?
joey Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
mr_treeger : You want me to kick you guys out instead?
joey No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
mr_treeger : You have pets!
joey Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
mr_treeger : Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
joey Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
mr_treeger : Really? You'll do anything?
joey Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
mr_treeger : Yeah, I've got something you can do.
joey What, what is it?
mr_treeger : Can you be my dancing partner?
joey That's not, prison lingo, is it?
monica His dancing partner?!
joey Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
rachel Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
joey Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
rachel Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
monica Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
chandler Hey.
rachel Hey! So, did you quit?
chandler No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
monica Wait, now so you joined the gym?
ross And that's funny, why?
rachel Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
chandler We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
monica Well, you could actually go to the gym.
ross Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
chandler You're a genius!
joey Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
chandler Now, there's two reasons.
phoebe Hey.
all Hey!
phoebe Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
rachel Where?!
phoebe On the touchy.
ross And that's not against your oath?!
phoebe No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
monica Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
joey Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!

mr_treeger : Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
mr_treeger : Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
joey No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
mr_treeger : Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
joey Come on man, you're not a potato.
mr_treeger : I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
joey Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!

mrs_potter Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
phoebe Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
mrs_potter Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
phoebe Yes, I will tell her.
monica So you didn't leave the bank?
ross No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
rachel What are you ever gonna use that for?!
chandler To pay for the gym.
chandler Hey.
phoebe Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
joey What?!
rachel You got fired?!
monica Oh my Gosh!
phoebe It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
rachel Sweety...
phoebe I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
mr_treeger : Hey Duck, is Chick here?
chandler Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
joey So you ah, ready for our last practice?
mr_treeger : Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.

joey We did it!!
mr_treeger : I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
