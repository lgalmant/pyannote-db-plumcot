phoebe_buffay Hey! New wallet, huh?
chandler_bing Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
monica_geller Rachel!
rachel_green What?
monica_geller You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
rachel_green Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
monica_geller Have you ever taken out the trash?
rachel_green Well, I thought you liked doing it.
monica_geller Third door on the left.
rachel_green Right!
rachel_green Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
mr_treeger : Hey.
mr_treeger : What are you doing?
rachel_green Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but
mr_treeger : No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
rachel_green I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
mr_treeger : Oh yeah, of course you don't!
rachel_green No.
mr_treeger : 'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
rachel_green I didn't... I never said that.
mr_treeger : You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
rachel_green Okay, I'm sorry.
monica_geller God! If you're gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
rachel_green Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
monica_geller Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
rachel_green That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
joey_tribbiani All right that's it, school is in session!
monica_geller My God! Is this a gym card?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
dr_ross_geller So why don't you quit?
chandler_bing You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
dr_ross_geller Who is Maria?
chandler_bing Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
dr_ross_geller You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
chandler_bing No!
dr_ross_geller So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
chandler_bing Oh no, you'll have to come.
mr_treeger : Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
joey_tribbiani Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
mr_treeger : And tell him what?
joey_tribbiani Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
mr_treeger : Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
joey_tribbiani I have actually not heard of that.
mr_treeger : Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
joey_tribbiani Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
phoebe_buffay Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
monica_geller What's the matter?
phoebe_buffay Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
monica_geller So do them for free.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
dr_ross_geller They make you take an oath?
phoebe_buffay No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
chandler_bing Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
phoebe_buffay No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
rachel_green Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
monica_geller Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
chandler_bing Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
monica_geller You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
phoebe_buffay I don't what your talking about.
dr_ross_geller Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
phoebe_buffay Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
rachel_green Oh! My hero! What happened?
joey_tribbiani Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
monica_geller What a minute, what did he say?
joey_tribbiani He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
rachel_green What?! You got us evicted!!
monica_geller I told you not to go down there!
joey_tribbiani Well he made Rachel cry!
monica_geller Rachel always cries!
rachel_green That's not true!
monica_geller Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
joey_tribbiani All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
rachel_green Go!!
joey_tribbiani All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
dr_ross_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
chandler_bing Yes. Yes!
dr_ross_geller One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
chandler_bing No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
dr_ross_geller Good! That's good!
chandler_bing Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
gym_employee You wanna quit?
chandler_bing I wanna quit the gym.
gym_employee You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
chandler_bing I wanna quit the gym.
gym_employee Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
dr_ross_geller Me? No.
gym_employee Sorry, members only.
chandler_bing I wanna quit the gym.
dr_ross_geller It's okay man, be strong.
gym_employee So, are you a member of any gym.
dr_ross_geller No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
gym_employee Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode04 Hi, I'm Maria.
rick Wow, you have really pretty feet.
phoebe_buffay These old things.
rick Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
phoebe_buffay You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
rick Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
rick Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
rick Ow! Did you just bite me?
phoebe_buffay No!
mr_treeger : What?
joey_tribbiani Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
mr_treeger : You want me to kick you guys out instead?
joey_tribbiani No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
mr_treeger : You have pets!
joey_tribbiani Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
mr_treeger : Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
joey_tribbiani Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
mr_treeger : Really? You'll do anything?
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
mr_treeger : Yeah, I've got something you can do.
joey_tribbiani What, what is it?
mr_treeger : Can you be my dancing partner?

monica_geller His dancing partner?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
rachel_green Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
joey_tribbiani Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
rachel_green Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
monica_geller Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
chandler_bing Hey.
rachel_green Hey! So, did you quit?
chandler_bing No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
monica_geller Wait, now so you joined the gym?
dr_ross_geller And that's funny, why?
rachel_green Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
chandler_bing We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
monica_geller Well, you could actually go to the gym.
dr_ross_geller Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
chandler_bing You're a genius!
joey_tribbiani Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
chandler_bing Now, there's two reasons.

dr_ross_geller And that's not against your oath?!
phoebe_buffay No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
monica_geller Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.

mr_treeger : Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
joey_tribbiani Come on man, you're not a potato.

phoebe_buffay Okay, quit down.
mrs_potter Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!

mrs_potter Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
mrs_potter Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
phoebe_buffay Yes, I will tell her.
monica_geller So you didn't leave the bank?
dr_ross_geller No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
rachel_green What are you ever gonna use that for?!
chandler_bing To pay for the gym.
chandler_bing Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.

phoebe_buffay It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
rachel_green Sweety...
phoebe_buffay I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
mr_treeger : Hey Duck, is Chick here?
chandler_bing Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
joey_tribbiani So you ah, ready for our last practice?
mr_treeger : Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
joey_tribbiani Look, you wanna use our place?
mr_treeger : No, I ahh, had another idea.
joey_tribbiani We did it!!
mr_treeger : I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
