joey_tribbiani Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
rachel_green Oh my...God! Let me see that!
joey_tribbiani You fall for it every time!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay I brought you my old maternity clothes!
rachel_green Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
phoebe_buffay Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
monica_geller Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
rachel_green No.
monica_geller He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
rachel_green Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
monica_geller No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
rachel_green Oh that's nice.
monica_geller Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
joey_tribbiani I just want you to say it once in a while.
monica_geller All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
joey_tribbiani What?!
monica_geller Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey
joey_tribbiani Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
joey_tribbiani No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
monica_geller All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
joey_tribbiani She is?
rachel_green Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
monica_geller Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
joey_tribbiani But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
monica_geller All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.
joey_tribbiani No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
monica_geller All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
joey_tribbiani That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
monica_geller Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Happy Thanksgiving!
monica_geller You too!
phoebe_buffay Anything I can do to help?
monica_geller Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
phoebe_buffay Sure!
monica_geller I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?
chandler_bing I have no idea.
phoebe_buffay What?
chandler_bing Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
phoebe_buffay I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
chandler_bing Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
monica_geller Is your team winning hon?
chandler_bing Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
phoebe_buffay Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
monica_geller Oh, I didn't know you liked football.
phoebe_buffay Well normally I don't, but y'know......Green Bay is playing.
monica_geller You like Green Bay?
phoebe_buffay Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
monica_geller Hey!
will_colbert Hey!
will_colbert Happy Thanksgiving!
monica_geller Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like
will_colbert 150 pounds. Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
monica_geller A pie!
will_colbert Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy...it's no good. Throw it out.
monica_geller You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
will_colbert Hey.
chandler_bing Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
monica_geller This is Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Wow! Well done.
monica_geller Wanna give me a hand?
will_colbert Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!
monica_geller Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
chandler_bing I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
monica_geller Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
will_colbert Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
monica_geller Good. And Rachel Green too.
will_colbert Oh.
monica_geller Is there a problem?
will_colbert Nope. Uh, it's okay. It's just uh, God I hated her.
monica_geller What?
will_colbert Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? No Will no!
chandler_bing Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
phoebe_buffay Oh okay.
chandler_bing Oh come on!
phoebe_buffay Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
monica_geller Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
joey_tribbiani Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
monica_geller All right.
joey_tribbiani Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
will_colbert I actually know what you're talking about. I'm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
joey_tribbiani Who the hell is this guy?
monica_geller Will! From high school.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey!
monica_geller Joey.
will_colbert Hello.
dr_ross_geller Will!
will_colbert Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff?
will_colbert It's good to see you man.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
will_colbert I'm a commodities broker.
dr_ross_geller Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
will_colbert Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
dr_ross_geller Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
will_colbert That was such a fun night!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
will_colbert Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
will_colbert God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
will_colbert So what do you, what do you do now?
dr_ross_geller So how long are you in town?
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Hey sweetie. Oh good.
will_colbert Rachel Green.
dr_ross_geller Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
will_colbert Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
dr_ross_geller Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
will_colbert Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
rachel_green Oh my God Monica, who is that?
monica_geller That's Will from high school!
rachel_green Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
monica_geller Okay, dinner's ready!
chandler_bing Good game!
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
chandler_bing Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
monica_geller Oh, so who won?
phoebe_buffay Green Bay.
chandler_bing Detroit.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...Mermen.
rachel_green Hi! Will, right?
will_colbert Right.
rachel_green Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
will_colbert Oh I-I remember you.
rachel_green Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
will_colbert You are unbelievable.
rachel_green Thank you!
monica_geller Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? And Will you sit way over there.
joey_tribbiani That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
monica_geller This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
joey_tribbiani Oh. How-how big is that?
monica_geller About nineteen pounds.
joey_tribbiani It's like me when I was born.
rachel_green All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
will_colbert Oh, you'd like that wouldn't ya?
rachel_green What? Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
will_colbert Typical.
rachel_green I'm sorry. What?
will_colbert I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.
joey_tribbiani Seriously, who is this guy?
rachel_green Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
will_colbert I don't know? Do I? Do I?
phoebe_buffay I think you do.
monica_geller Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
will_colbert A little mean? You made my life miserable!
rachel_green I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I
will_colbert Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
monica_geller Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard
will_colbert Yams!!!!
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school
will_colbert Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!
rachel_green You had a club?!
will_colbert That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
rachel_green Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
will_colbert Me and Ross.
dr_ross_geller No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
rachel_green So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
will_colbert Yes he was.
dr_ross_geller No. No.
rachel_green So who else was in this club?
dr_ross_geller Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.
rachel_green So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
will_colbert You went out with her?! We had a pact!
dr_ross_geller That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.
will_colbert Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
rachel_green Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
monica_geller I swear I didn't. Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
dr_ross_geller@will_colbert Yeah.
monica_geller Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
dr_ross_geller Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I...I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
will_colbert Co-founded!
dr_ross_geller ...co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
will_colbert Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
rachel_green Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
will_colbert Well, we did a little more than that.
dr_ross_geller No-no! No-no. No-no.
phoebe_buffay What?! What else did you do?
will_colbert We started a rumor.
rachel_green What rumor?
phoebe_buffay Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
rachel_green Ross!
dr_ross_geller It was no big deal. We-we...said that the rumor was...that umm...you had both...male and female reproductive parts.
rachel_green What?!
will_colbert That's right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
rachel_green Oh my God!
monica_geller You started that?!
rachel_green What?! You heard that?!
monica_geller Everyone at our school heard it!
chandler_bing Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
rachel_green Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
dr_ross_geller Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one's not really our fault.
rachel_green Monica, how come you never told me this?!
monica_geller I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
rachel_green Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
joey_tribbiani I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
rachel_green Oh!
joey_tribbiani You are my Everest.
monica_geller Joey, you don't have to finish that.
joey_tribbiani Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just...I just-I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give.
rachel_green Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
dr_ross_geller Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
rachel_green "Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
dr_ross_geller Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!
rachel_green Yes!
will_colbert Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
monica_geller Oh! Me too!
dr_ross_geller Well look-look I'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
rachel_green I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
monica_geller That's not totally true.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
dr_ross_geller How did you know that?!!!!
monica_geller It's true?!!
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
will_colbert Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
chandler_bing I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
dr_ross_geller Hey! She didn't look 50!
chandler_bing Did she look 16?
rachel_green Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Wow!
dr_ross_geller She didn't photograph well!
chandler_bing Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
phoebe_buffay So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
dr_ross_geller I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
monica_geller Didn't she walk with a cane?
dr_ross_geller Only when it was damp!! I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? I'm back in the club!
will_colbert Yeah!
phoebe_buffay I wanna join!
rachel_green Wh-Phoebe!!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
rachel_green All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!
monica_geller All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
rachel_green Wow
monica_geller And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
dr_ross_geller As a romancer of the elderly.
monica_geller Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
dr_ross_geller The eyes...did still sparkle.
monica_geller Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
rachel_green She's right.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
will_colbert Hold on! You got her pregnant?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
will_colbert Are ya getting married?
dr_ross_geller Nope.
will_colbert So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude! Anybody?
phoebe_buffay Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
joey_tribbiani All right where's that turkey!
phoebe_buffay Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
joey_tribbiani Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
joey_tribbiani Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
monica_geller Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
chandler_bing Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
phoebe_buffay Is there anything we can do for you?
joey_tribbiani No just, nobody press on my stomach.
rachel_green You can keep those pants by the way.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
monica_geller Yeah, you want some?
joey_tribbiani Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
