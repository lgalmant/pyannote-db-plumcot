phoebe Hey...
all Hey!
rachel Hi!
ross Pheebs, what's wrong?
phoebe Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
all OH!
rachel My God!
joey Hey! Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
ross So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
phoebe Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
joey Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
all Whoo!
phoebe Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
rachel Mmh-mmh!
phoebe It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
rachel Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
phoebe I would, but you're the last one.
rachel GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
phoebe Oh, my first love!
rachel Oh!
monica What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
phoebe Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
chandler Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
rachel Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
phoebe Oh yes, they are.
chandler Hey honey!
joey Hi sweetie!
chandler Is Monica not here?
joey No.
chandler Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
joey Cool!
chandler Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
joey That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
chandler Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
joey What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
chandler First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
joey I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
chandler Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
joey I'm cold!
ross Hey!
charlie Hey!
ross Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
charlie Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
ross Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
charlie Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
ross Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
charlie Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
ross Yeah. Why?
charlie Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
ross Your ex-boyfriend?
charlie Yeah.
ross So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
charlie No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
ross Well, if you think it would help.
charlie Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
ross Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
charlie Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
ross We'll see how dinner goes.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
phoebe Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
monica Oh, right.
phoebe Yeah.
monica Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
phoebe Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
monica Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up? Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
monica Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
phoebe Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
monica Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
phoebe Why, you don't like her?
monica Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
phoebe Really? You think?
monica Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
phoebe Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
monica Damn it, I did not think this through!
chandler Hey you guys.
rachel Hi!
joey Oh! Any word on casting yet?
chandler Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
joey What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
rachel I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
joey Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
chandler Joe...
joey Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
chandler Fine!
joey Thank you.
chandler Work, Joe!
joey Damn it!
chandler What am I gonna do now?
joey Just pass it to your boss!
chandler He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
rachel Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
chandler That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work!
ross I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
charlie Sorry, looks like it's just him.
benjamin Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
ross Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
benjamin So good to see you.
charlie Me too.
ross I'm ok.
charlie I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
ross It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
benjamin Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
charlie Shall we?
benjamin Thank you! I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
charlie Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place!
benjamin You weren't there!
ross No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
charlie Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?
benjamin So, tell me about it.
ross Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
benjamin M-m.
ross See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
benjamin Break up with Charlie!
ross What?
benjamin What?
ross Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
benjamin Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
ross Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
benjamin I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
ross Are you serious?
benjamin If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
ross No!
benjamin Joking it is!
phoebe Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
monica Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
phoebe No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
monica Wow, what's the bad news!
rachel Who's Gladys?
phoebe Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
rachel Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
phoebe Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
monica Huh!
rachel Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
monica You know, I would give her up, for you.
rachel No, I couldn't let you do that.
monica But I want to.
rachel But I don't want you to.
monica But I insist!
rachel But I insist harder!
phoebe Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. Tails! Monica, she's yours!
monica No, that landed in your food!
rachel No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
chandler Hey Joe!
joey What's up?
chandler Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
joey Oh.
chandler I'm sorry man.
joey But, ehm... you watched the tape?
chandler Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
joey You didn't watch the tape.
chandler What!? Of course I did!
joey Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
chandler I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
joey Well, you lied again!
chandler I watched it!
joey Keep going Pinocchio!
chandler I did!
joey No you didn't!
chandler I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
rachel Did you watch the tape?
chandler No!
benjamin The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?
dr_li Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
benjamin Interesting.
ross I guess!
benjamin Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?
dr_biely Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
benjamin Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
ross What? I... I...
benjamin Care to venture a guess?
ross May 12th?
benjamin That's not even kinda close! Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
dr_li Half a dozen.
benjamin I see, and Dr. Biely?
dr_biely Three for excavation and two for analysis.
benjamin Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
ross Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
benjamin No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
ross Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
benjamin You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
ross um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
benjamin Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
ross Ok. B - O - S..
benjamin No, it starts with a silent "M".
ross Oh come on!!
chandler I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
rachel But you are a liar.
chandler What did I just say?
joey You still here?
chandler Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
joey Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
chandler Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
joey You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
rachel Well, this is going well.
joey Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
joey And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape!
chandler He really is a chameleon.
phoebe Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
monica Oh, my!
rachel Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
monica I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
rachel Well, hey! How about right above the TV? That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
phoebe Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
monica I like that poster!
phoebe Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
rachel Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
monica Are you still here?
ross Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
benjamin I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
ross No! Stop!
benjamin Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
ross Really?
benjamin Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
ross I have to break up with Charlie?
benjamin Hey, you got one right!
ross You're crazy.
benjamin Crazy, or... romantic?
ross Crazy!
benjamin Ooor...
ross Get out!
rachel O-oh my God!
joey What?
rachel Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
joey I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
rachel Joey, we're not keeping this!
joey But it's an original Buffay...
rachel Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
joey Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
rachel Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
rachel She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
joey GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
monica Hey! I sold that to Joey.
rachel Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
monica No, too late. You can't give it back!
rachel Yes I can!
monica No you can't. She's yours!
rachel She's yours!
monica SHE'S YOURS!
rachel She's yours!
phoebe Hey!
rachel She's mine!
monica She's m-i-i-ne!
rachel She's mine!
monica She's mine!
phoebe You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
rachel I want Gladys!
monica She's mine!
rachel She's mine!
monica She's mine!
rachel She's mine!
chandler Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
joey That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
chandler I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
monica Oh my God!
rachel Excellent!
joey Now, what do you say?
chandler Lying is wrong!
joey And?... AND?
chandler I'm a pretty little girl.
phoebe I knew it!
ross Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
charlie Did you get the grant?
ross No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
charlie What?
ross Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
charlie Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
ross Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
charlie I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
ross If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
charlie Seriously?
ross Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
charlie Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
ross Damnit!
benjamin Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
ross I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
benjamin Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
ross No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
charlie Benji?
benjamin Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
ross Too little, too late, Benji!
charlie I can't believe this.
benjamin I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
ross No!
charlie Yes!
ross What?
charlie I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
ross or...
benjamin Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
charlie Maybe...
ross Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
charlie Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
benjamin I'm sorry too...
benjamin I love you!
charlie I love you too!
ross Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
joey Gladys?
rachel Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
joey You're mean!
rachel Oh, don't be such a baby!
