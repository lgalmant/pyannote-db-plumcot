monica Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
phoebe Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
susan Oh, is he hungry already?
carol I guess so.
chandler You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
joey I gotta get one, too.
ross What are you guys doing?
chandler We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
ross Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
joey Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
ross This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
ross Carol?
chandler Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
carol Sure.
joey Uh, does it hurt?
carol It did at first, but not anymore.
joey Chandler?
chandler So, uh, how often can you do it?
carol As much as he needs.
joey Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
julie Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
rachel Yeah, I forget which ones.
julie Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
all No thanks.
julie Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
rachel Thank you. What a bitch.
julie Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
phoebe I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
monica Ok, um, I'll go with you.
julie Great.
ross Hi, honey.
chandler Hey, sweetums.
ross Hello to the rest.
all Hi!
joey Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
monica It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
chandler Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
monica But I'm...
phoebe Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
ross So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
monica Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
ross It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
monica You're welcome.
phoebe Woof, woof.
joey Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
annabelle Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
joey Who?
annabelle Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
hombre_man Hombre?
joey What's he doin' in my section?
annabelle I guess he doesn't know.
joey Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
hombre_man Mornin'.
joey Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
hombre_man Your territory, huh?
joey Yeah. Bijan for men?
guy No thanks.
hombre_man Hombre?
guy Yeah. All right.
hombre_man You were saying?
monica Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
phoebe What?
monica We were shopping, and we had lunch.
phoebe Oh, all right. What did I have?
monica You had a salad.
phoebe Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
rachel Hey, guys, what's up.
phoebe I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
rachel Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
phoebe Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
rachel You went shopping for fur?
phoebe Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
rachel You bought boobs?
phoebe Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
joey Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
annabelle Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
hombre_man Ready, Annabelle?
annabelle You bet. Maybe some other time?
joey Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
carol Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
ross Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
susan Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
rachel Oh, this is so cute.
susan Oh, I got that for him.
ross My mommies love me. That's clever.
monica Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju--Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
rachel Did you just say Hi, Jew?
monica Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
phoebe Ben, dinner!
ross Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
phoebe Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
chandler What did you just do?
phoebe I licked my arm, what?
ross It's breast milk.
phoebe So?
rachel Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
joey What is the big deal?
chandler What did you just do?
ross Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
phoebe You won't even taste it?
ross No!
phoebe Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
ross Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
monica Hey, where is everybody?
rachel They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
monica Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
rachel Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
monica Okay.
rachel Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
monica You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
rachel And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
monica That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
rachel Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
monica Judy.
rachel Who?
monica Julie.
rachel What?!
monica Jody!
rachel You were with Julie?
monica Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
rachel Oh. Oh my God.
monica Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
rachel Yeah, right. Sure!
monica Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
rachel Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
monica That is not true!
rachel Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
monica Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
rachel Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
monica Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
carol_and_susan Hey!
carol How did we do?
phoebe Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
ross I did not freak out.
carol Why'd you freak out?
ross Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
carol My breast milk is gross?
susan This should be fun.
ross No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
chandler Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
carol Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
ross That would be no.
phoebe Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
joey Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
susan Cantaloupe juice.
joey Exactly.
ross You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
susan Uh huh.
ross Oh, you've tasted it.
susan You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
ross Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
chandler Howdy.
joey Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
chandler Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
joey Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
chandler What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
joey I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
chandler All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
joey Yeah I guess you're right.
chandler You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
joey I'm gonna do it.
chandler All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
monica I don't know what else to say.
rachel Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
monica I feel terrible, I really do.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
monica Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
rachel Yes.
monica It's that terrible?
rachel Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
monica Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
rachel I love you too.
phoebe You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
monica Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
rachel I'd do anything for you, you know that.
monica I'd do anything for you.
phoebe Wait, wait, wait, wait!
joey Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
hombre_man I heard ya.
store_guy All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
hombre_man Ready.
joey Yeah, I'm ready.
customer You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
store_guy Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
hombre_man I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
annabelle My god, what happened?
joey These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
annabelle Sure.
julie So.
rachel So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
julie I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
rachel Really? Me?
julie Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
rachel Well, you're not totally paranoid.
julie Oy.
rachel Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
julie Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
rachel Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
julie I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
rachel All right, Julie.
julie Bye.
rachel Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
ross That's not bad.
