dr_ross_geller Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
joey_tribbiani Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
dr_ross_geller I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
chandler_bing Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
monica_geller With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
chandler_bing It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
monica_geller Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
chandler_bing Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
monica_geller Okay that does sound like fun.
chandler_bing Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
monica_geller The second sister dies?!
chandler_bing No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
monica_geller The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
chandler_bing That's correct.
rachel_green You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
tag_jones Sure.
rachel_green Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
tag_jones If this is your idea of sexy talk?
rachel_green No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
tag_jones What contracts?
rachel_green Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
tag_jones Like what?
rachel_green Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
tag_jones Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
rachel_green Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
tag_jones I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
rachel_green Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
tag_jones No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
rachel_green Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
tag_jones You wanna go down to the office right now?
rachel_green No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
tag_jones Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
rachel_green Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
joey_tribbiani All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
dr_ross_geller Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
joey_tribbiani Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
joey_tribbiani What if I smack my head on the concrete?
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
joey_tribbiani I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
dr_ross_geller Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
joey_tribbiani No.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Well, you be careful.
joey_tribbiani What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
dr_ross_geller Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
joey_tribbiani Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
phoebe_buffay Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
monica_geller Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
chandler_bing What? What? What?
monica_geller Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
tag_jones Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
rachel_green Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
tag_jones It's my sister.
rachel_green Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
tag_jones So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
rachel_green In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
tag_jones It's not here.
rachel_green Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
tag_jones How could I have left them in the copy room?
rachel_green I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
tag_jones Fine.
rachel_green Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
monica_geller Are you still awake?
chandler_bing Yeah! You?
monica_geller You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up
chandler_bing Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
joey_tribbiani Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
dr_ross_geller Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
joey_tribbiani Yeah? Really? No one's home?
dr_ross_geller I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there
phoebe_buffay Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
monica_geller What?! What are you doing?!
chandler_bing Do you know what just happened?
monica_geller Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
chandler_bing No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
monica_geller Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
chandler_bing Monica?
monica_geller What?!

chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Give me the good stuff.
chandler_bing Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
monica_geller Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
rachel_green Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh.....fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
tag_jones Still no luck.

tag_jones Do you want me to check again?
rachel_green Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
tag_jones Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
rachel_green Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
tag_jones Any luck?
rachel_green Can I see you in my office for a minute?
tag_jones Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
rachel_green You put these on my desk!
tag_jones I did not!
rachel_green Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
tag_jones How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
rachel_green I am so hot for you right now.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
a_disembodied_voice#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode12 Phoebe Buffay?!
phoebe_buffay Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
the_fireman We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
phoebe_buffay That's not mine.
the_fireman Yes it is.
phoebe_buffay How do you know?
the_fireman The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
phoebe_buffay Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
the_fireman Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
phoebe_buffay Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
the_fireman There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
phoebe_buffay There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!

joey_tribbiani All right! Just hurry up!
dr_ross_geller Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.

joey_tribbiani Face to face, yeah!
dr_ross_geller Okay, here I go.
joey_tribbiani All right.
joey_tribbiani Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
dr_ross_geller I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
dr_ross_geller So what do you want me to do?
joey_tribbiani Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
dr_ross_geller M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
dr_ross_geller It's still looks pretty far!
joey_tribbiani It's not that far! Just drop!
dr_ross_geller Do not rush me!!
joey_tribbiani Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
dr_ross_geller Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
monica_geller That really was some of your best work.
chandler_bing Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
