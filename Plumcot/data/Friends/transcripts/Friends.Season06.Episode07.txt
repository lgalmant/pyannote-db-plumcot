rachel_green Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
dr_ross_geller So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
chandler_bing And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
chandler_bing I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
monica_geller Oh, So you can move them!
chandler_bing Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
joey_tribbiani Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
janine_lecroix Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hi!
janine_lecroix Hi
joey_tribbiani Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
monica_geller It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
janine_lecroix Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
joey_tribbiani I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
chandler_bing So, uh, wh-where ya from?
janine_lecroix Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
joey_tribbiani From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
dr_ross_geller So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
janine_lecroix I'm a dancer.
joey_tribbiani You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
janine_lecroix Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey let me.
monica_geller Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
joey_tribbiani Of course I did.
monica_geller Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
joey_tribbiani "When can you move in?"
dr_ross_geller Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
chandler_bing Unbelievable
monica_geller Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
chandler_bing Hey, look at all the boxes!
joey_tribbiani Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
monica_geller Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
chandler_bing All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
joey_tribbiani Oh God, yeah.
chandler_bing Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
joey_tribbiani Okay!
chandler_bing No-no
joey_tribbiani Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
monica_geller Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
joey_tribbiani Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
monica_geller Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
joey_tribbiani You a little sad about that sweetheart?
phoebe_buffay I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
rachel_green Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
rachel_green You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
dr_ross_geller Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
rachel_green Oh! I used to do that too!
monica_geller Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
rachel_green Aw, Mon...
monica_geller So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
rachel_green Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
monica_geller Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
phoebe_buffay Why? Why would you do that?
monica_geller I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
rachel_green Ankle.
monica_geller We'll see.
chandler_bing OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
joey_tribbiani I Gotcha!!
chandler_bing Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
joey_tribbiani Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
chandler_bing Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
joey_tribbiani I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
chandler_bing Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
joey_tribbiani Ohhhh man
janine_lecroix Sorry, there's just more room out here.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
janine_lecroix Why don't you try to do-
janine_lecroix What's wrong?
joey_tribbiani Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
janine_lecroix Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
phoebe_buffay Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
rachel_green No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
phoebe_buffay Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
rachel_green No, wait Phoebe.
dr_ross_geller Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
chandler_bing What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
dr_ross_geller Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
chandler_bing Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
dr_ross_geller Put it back exactly where you found it?
chandler_bing Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
dr_ross_geller 'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
chandler_bing She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
dr_ross_geller Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
chandler_bing She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
dr_ross_geller Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
chandler_bing I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
dr_ross_geller Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
chandler_bing No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
monica_geller Hi!
chandler_bing Hey Mon, how's it going?
monica_geller Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
chandler_bing Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
monica_geller It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
chandler_bing No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
monica_geller Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
chandler_bing It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
chandler_bing We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
dr_ross_geller Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
chandler_bing What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
dr_ross_geller Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
chandler_bing OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
dr_ross_geller Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
chandler_bing Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
joey_tribbiani Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I've been married 3 times
joey_tribbiani No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
dr_ross_geller Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
chandler_bing Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
chandler_bing Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
dr_ross_geller Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
chandler_bing That's not specific to girls.
joey_tribbiani This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
dr_ross_geller Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
chandler_bing And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
dr_ross_geller They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
chandler_bing Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
dr_ross_geller I'm never gonna find love again.
rachel_green Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe_buffay Sure
rachel_green Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
phoebe_buffay So, what should you have done?
rachel_green Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
phoebe_buffay Uh-Huh, Which is...?
rachel_green Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
phoebe_buffay So?
rachel_green Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
phoebe_buffay Why do you care?
rachel_green Because they're people.
phoebe_buffay But people that you don't know and will never see again.
rachel_green Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
phoebe_buffay Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
rachel_green I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
phoebe_buffay That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
chandler_bing Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
dr_ross_geller Who cares? I repel women.
chandler_bing No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
monica_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller What?!
chandler_bing I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
dr_ross_geller Why does anyone have to be naked?
monica_geller Why is Ross naked?
dr_ross_geller I-I had to show Chandler something?
monica_geller Naked?
dr_ross_geller Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
monica_geller Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
chandler_bing Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
monica_geller Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
chandler_bing Bye! Thank God
dr_ross_geller Dude, what'd you have?
chandler_bing Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
dr_ross_geller The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
chandler_bing That's perfect! That's brilliant!
dr_ross_geller So really, what'd ya have?
janine_lecroix Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
joey_tribbiani Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
janine_lecroix Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
joey_tribbiani Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
janine_lecroix Is there something wrong?
joey_tribbiani All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
janine_lecroix Joey...
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
janine_lecroix Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
joey_tribbiani Oh!
janine_lecroix No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
joey_tribbiani Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
janine_lecroix I don't think so.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I do. How you doin?
janine_lecroix I'm OK
joey_tribbiani What?!?!
janine_lecroix What?
joey_tribbiani Oh dear God!
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
phoebe_buffay See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
rachel_green Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
monica_geller Is it okay for me to come in now?
chandler_bing Uh-huh
monica_geller Why is everything different?
dr_ross_geller Bye!
chandler_bing No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
monica_geller Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
chandler_bing Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
monica_geller It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
chandler_bing Do you want me to be afraid of you?
monica_geller Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
chandler_bing Really?
monica_geller Of course!
chandler_bing Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
monica_geller All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
dr_ross_geller So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
janine_lecroix ..and live forever as a machine!
dr_ross_geller That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
janine_lecroix Yeah, I gotta go.
chandler_bing Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
