commercial_voiceover#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...
commercial_voiceover#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 ..With MonkeyShine Beer. MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.]
dr_ross_geller That commercial always makes me so sad.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
dr_ross_geller I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
phoebe_buffay I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
monica_geller And the fact that they're both monkeys.
dr_ross_geller Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
rachel_green Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
dr_ross_geller Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
chandler_bing Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
chandler_bing Rhythm?
joey_tribbiani No, my first fan mail.
all@ Alright!
monica_geller 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
rachel_green Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
monica_geller This wasn't addressed to
joey_tribbiani Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys.
all@ Hey.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
dr_ross_geller Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
chandler_bing You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
rachel_green Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
phoebe_buffay Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
phoebe_buffay I know, I know. Hello.
rob_donnen Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
phoebe_buffay Hi Rob Dohnen.
rob_donnen I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
phoebe_buffay Oh, wow.
rob_donnen Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I would love to have kids. you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
joey_tribbiani Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
chandler_bing Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
chandler_bing Hello.
erika_ford It's Erica.
joey_tribbiani Ah, the stalker.
erika_ford Never mind, it's open.
chandler_bing Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
joey_tribbiani Let's get out of here.
chandler_bing The one time they're not home.
joey_tribbiani OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
chandler_bing That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
joey_tribbiani She's comin'.
erika_ford It's me.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
chandler_bing Wait, wait, wait.
erika_ford Hi.
joey_tribbiani Erica.
mr_lipson Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
dr_ross_geller Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
mr_lipson Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, what happened?
mr_lipson Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this.
mr_lipson I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
dr_ross_geller Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
mr_lipson I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
dr_ross_geller Zoo dollars?
mr_lipson Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
kids#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Ooohhh.
phoebe_buffay I know.
monica_geller I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
chandler_bing Well, you remember Cathy Bates in
monica_geller@rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
rachel_green And she's not crazy?
chandler_bing Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
rachel_green Oh my God.
monica_geller Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
chandler_bing Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
rob_donnen You OK?
phoebe_buffay No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
rob_donnen That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
phoebe_buffay I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
dr_ross_geller I was thinkin' about it.
phoebe_buffay OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
all@ Hi Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.
erika_ford Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
joey_tribbiani Yeah it is. what?
erika_ford Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
erika_ford Who's they?
joey_tribbiani No one.
erika_ford Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. but I won't.
joey_tribbiani Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
erika_ford No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
joey_tribbiani Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
waiter Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
erika_ford Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
dr_ross_geller Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 It's about your monkey. It's alive.
erika_ford I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
erika_ford No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
joey_tribbiani But that's what...
erika_ford I should just be happy to be near you.
joey_tribbiani Hey I-
erika_ford Hey what?
joey_tribbiani That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
monica_geller Excellent!
chandler_bing Very informative!
rachel_green Not at all inappropriate!
phoebe_buffay Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
rob_donnen That was great, the kids loved you.
phoebe_buffay Yay, I rock.
rob_donnen And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
phoebe_buffay But.
rob_donnen How did you know there was a but?
phoebe_buffay I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
rob_donnen The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
phoebe_buffay I can do that.
rob_donnen Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rob_donnen Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
phoebe_buffay Thinkin' about it.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
dr_ross_geller Buddy, my monkey?
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
dr_ross_geller That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
dr_ross_geller That guy Lipson?
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
dr_ross_geller No, I, I only know Lipson.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
dr_ross_geller Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
dr_ross_geller Of course.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
dr_ross_geller This is unbelievable.
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
dr_ross_geller Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 Maybe.
dr_ross_geller But you already told me everything.
dr_ross_geller Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
rachel_green Well, so what're you gonna do?
dr_ross_geller Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
chandler_bing That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
phoebe_buffay OK, hi again.
all@ Hi Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
tv_doctor#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode12 You're the only one who can save her Drake.
joey_tribbiani Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
dr_ross_geller Well, there goes my whole belief system.
erika_ford It's Erica.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
rachel_green No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
joey_tribbiani Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
rachel_green Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
monica_geller Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
joey_tribbiani Hey Erica, c'mon in.
erika_ford How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
joey_tribbiani Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
erika_ford Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
joey_tribbiani Who?
erika_ford Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
joey_tribbiani It's not what you think, that was...
erika_ford You told me I was the only one.
joey_tribbiani Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
erika_ford Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
joey_tribbiani Somebody wanna help me out here?
rachel_green Oh, I know, I know.
erika_ford How, how can you be here and there.
joey_tribbiani 'Cause it's a television show.
erika_ford Drake, what're you getting at?
joey_tribbiani I'm not Drake.
dr_ross_geller That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
erika_ford Is this true?
rachel_green Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
monica_geller And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
chandler_bing And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
erika_ford Is all this true?
joey_tribbiani Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
erika_ford Oh Hans.
dr_ross_geller Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
joey_tribbiani Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
erika_ford I'll never forget you Hans.
joey_tribbiani OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
phoebe_buffay Fired! Why?
rob_donnen The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
rob_donnen No.
phoebe_buffay I see.
rob_donnen Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
phoebe_buffay No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
rob_donnen I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
phoebe_buffay Who's Barney.
dr_ross_geller Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming
rachel_green You're kidding.
joey_tribbiani This is amazing.
dr_ross_geller I know.
joey_tribbiani I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
phoebe_buffay OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
rachel_green OK.
little_boy Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
phoebe_buffay Um, yeah I guess that's me.
little_boy She's here.
dr_ross_geller This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
chandler_bing What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
security_guard C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
dr_ross_geller Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
security_guard I'm sorry guys, closed set.
dr_ross_geller Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
security_guard Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
monica_geller Ross, there he is.
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.
