dr_ross_geller Come on, don't do this.
monica_geller What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
chandler_bing Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
joey_tribbiani Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
monica_geller That is so funny. Let me see that.
joey_tribbiani Are you ok, Ross?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. What's in this pie?
monica_geller Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
dr_ross_geller Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
monica_geller No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
dr_ross_geller And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
monica_geller No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
dr_ross_geller Ugh.
monica_geller Oh my god.
dr_ross_geller Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
monica_geller Is your tongue swelling up?
dr_ross_geller Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
monica_geller All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
joey_tribbiani Is he gonna be ok?
monica_geller Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
dr_ross_geller You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
monica_geller Jacket now.
dr_ross_geller What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
chandler_bing We'll watch him.
dr_ross_geller I don't think tho.
joey_tribbiani What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
chandler_bing I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
dr_ross_geller Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
joey_tribbiani Hat, milk, got it.
dr_ross_geller ??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
joey_tribbiani Consider it done.
chandler_bing You understood that?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
chandler_bing Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
rachel_green Ok.
phoebe_buffay I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
terry Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
rachel_green What's up?
terry F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
rachel_green But what about Phoebe?
terry Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
rachel_green Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
terry Uh--
rachel_green Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
phoebe_buffay Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
chandler_bing You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
joey_tribbiani It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
chandler_bing No, I got him.
joey_tribbiani No, seriously.
chandler_bing Oh, seriously you want him?
caroline_duffy Hello.
boys#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 Hello.
caroline_duffy And who is this little cutie pie?
chandler_bing Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
joey_tribbiani You wanna smell him?
caroline_duffy I assume we're talking about the baby now.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
caroline_duffy I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
joey_tribbiani What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
caroline_duffy I think it's great you guys are doing this.
chandler_bing Well, we are great guys.
caroline_duffy You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
phoebe_buffay But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
rachel_green Honey, I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
rachel_green Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
rachel_green Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
terry I, I don't know.
rachel_green Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
terry You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
rachel_green Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
terry Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
rachel_green Done.
phoebe_buffay Really?
rachel_green Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
phoebe_buffay Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
rachel_green Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
rachel_green Well, but Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
dr_ross_geller Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
doctor_karl Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
monica_geller Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
dr_ross_geller Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
monica_geller My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
doctor_karl No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
dr_ross_geller Tho?
dr_ross_geller Ohhh.
monica_geller That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
dr_ross_geller Ok.
monica_geller Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
chandler_bing That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, look at that talent.
chandler_bing Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
girl_1_on_bus#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 Hey, you. He's just adorable.
chandler_bing Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
girl_2_on_bus#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 So what are you guys out doing today?
joey_tribbiani Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.

chandler_bing Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
both#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
monica_geller Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.

dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
phoebe_buffay ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
stephanie_schiffer Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
phoebe_buffay Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
stephanie_schiffer All of them.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, so you know D?
stephanie_schiffer Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Ok, do you know A minor?
stephanie_schiffer Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
stephanie_schiffer Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
stephanie_schiffer No.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
chandler_bing Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
joey_tribbiani Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
rachel_green Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
phoebe_buffay Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
rachel_green Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
stephanie_schiffer Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
phoebe_buffay You're all invited to bite me!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
transit_authority_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
chandler_bing That's me.
joey_tribbiani I'm him.
chandler_bing Actually, uh, we're both the father.
chandler_bing Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
joey_tribbiani Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
chandler_bing Ok.
joey_tribbiani Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
chandler_bing Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
joey_tribbiani Ahh!
chandler_bing What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
joey_tribbiani Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
chandler_bing Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
joey_tribbiani You got a better idea?
chandler_bing All right, call it in the air.
joey_tribbiani Heads.
chandler_bing Heads it is.
joey_tribbiani Yes! Whew!
chandler_bing We have to assign heads to something.
joey_tribbiani Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
chandler_bing What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hi.
rachel_green Here. I thought you might be cold.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
rachel_green Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
phoebe_buffay Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
rachel_green Do you?
phoebe_buffay No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
rachel_green Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
phoebe_buffay It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
rachel_green Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
phoebe_buffay Really? From who?
rachel_green Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
kid#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Here you go.
kid#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
dr_ross_geller I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
monica_geller That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
monica_geller Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
dr_ross_geller Oh.
monica_geller Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
dr_ross_geller Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
monica_geller No. But I remember people telling me about it.
dr_ross_geller I hope Ben has a little sister.
monica_geller Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
monica_geller That was you?
dr_ross_geller They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
monica_geller Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
chandler_bing Hey, he's not crying.
joey_tribbiani Yes! There's still pie.
dr_ross_geller I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
dr_ross_geller Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
chandler_bing You, you are gonna love this.
dr_ross_geller Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
chandler_bing Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
stephanie_schiffer Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
phoebe_buffay No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
stephanie_schiffer Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
phoebe_buffay Better. Yeah.
stephanie_schiffer Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
stephanie_schiffer Yeah.
phoebe_buffay You wanna try it again?
stephanie_schiffer Yeah. From the top?
phoebe_buffay Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
stephanie_schiffer Ok.
phoebe_buffay Mmmm hmmm.
together#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode06 Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
phoebe_buffay That's too much. Sorry.
