host Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
phoebe Oh, oh! It's on again!
joey You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
all Shhhh!
host Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
joey Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
mike And there is Kevin.
joey Can we please turn this off?
rachel Noo way, Kevin.
mike There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
ross Are you intrigued?
chandler You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
mike Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
joey Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
chandler Well, it's official there are no good movies.
janice Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
monica Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
joey Hey!
phoebe Hey.
chandler Hey, man. What's up?
joey Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
chandler Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
phoebe Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
joey How is it you?
phoebe Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
joey Yep, that's my audition.
monica See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
phoebe Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
janice What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
joey Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
phoebe That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
joey Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
phoebe What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
joey What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
phoebe No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
joey Hang up, hang up.
phoebe 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
chandler Is anybody else scared?
phoebe 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
chandler Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
monica Oh, now you want a pad.
carol_and_susan Hey!!
ross There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
carol He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
susan He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
ross Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
susan So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
carol This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
ross You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
ross Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
rachel Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
monica I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
joey I love that movie.
monica There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
joey I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
chandler Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
joey Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
chandler Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
rachel What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
chandler Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
ross And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
chandler Noo.
ross You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
chandler No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head
rachel Men are unbelievable.
monica What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
chandler I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
monica Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
joey Hey, you know about that?!
chandler Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
ross Where there is no fear of commitment.
chandler Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
joey Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
rachel Amazingly, that makes sense.
chandler You think?
joey Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
chandler Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
phoebe Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
rachel Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
joey Come on baby, come on!
phoebe 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
rachel Very nice touch.
phoebe 'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
rachel Unbelievable.
joey Thank you so much.
phoebe It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
joey You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
phoebe Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
joey Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
phoebe Two?
joey Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
phoebe Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
joey Nooo, four.
janice So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
chandler 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
janice Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
chandler Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
janice Oh, you didn't have to do this.
chandler Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
janice Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
chandler Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
janice We should?
chandler Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
janice I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
chandler I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
janice You probably want us to move in together?
chandler It doesn't scare me!
janice Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
chandler Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
rachel Honey, this will help.
chandler So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
rachel_and_monica Uff.
monica That is never good.
chandler Then I got all needy and clingy.
rachel Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
chandler She said she'd call me.
rachel_and_monica Ohh!
chandler Oh God.
monica Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
chandler This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
rachel Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
monica You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
rachel Yeah, you do.
chandler So, you don't think I'm terminal?
monica Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
chandler Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
rachel_and_monica Nooo!
rachel This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
monica She has to know that your not ready.
rachel Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
chandler So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
rachel Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
chandler I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
rachel Oh.
ross Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
rachel G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
joey G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
ross Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
joey_and_ross Go Joe!!!
phoebe Helloo! Oh!
joey Pheebs! There you are!
phoebe No it's not, sorry.
joey But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
phoebe Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
joey Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
phoebe Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
joey It's okay, these things happen.
phoebe But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
joey I'm, I'm okay. See.
phoebe Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
joey No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
phoebe Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
joey They actually said that?
phoebe Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
joey No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
phoebe Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
ross You'll never get me, Joe!!!
janice No, thank you. Chandler!
chandler Hello, Janice.
janice What are you doing here?
chandler Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
janice Are you being British?!
chandler No. Not anymore.
janice Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
chandler Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
janice Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
chandler Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
janice Where is this party?
chandler Here in Chelsea.
janice Who's party is it?
chandler A woman's
janice What woman?!
chandler Chelsea.
janice Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
chandler Can I be that guy?
phoebe Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
joey Okay, shoot.
phoebe Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
joey I didn't get it?
phoebe No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
joey Okay, what else?
phoebe Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
joey Oh.
phoebe Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
joey Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
phoebe Oh.
joey Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
phoebe Yeah, no, I understand.
joey You do, thanks.
phoebe Yeah. Sorry.
joey Wait a minute.
phoebe What?
joey Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
phoebe Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
joey That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
chandler ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
monica My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
chandler I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
rachel Yeah, it is.
monica You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
chandler Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
rachel Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
monica If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
rachel Yeah.
chandler Hello!
monica Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
rachel Yes, and grumpy.
chandler What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
rachel He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
chandler I love you too.
monica Aw, it's soo unfair.
carol G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
ross Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
susan What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
ross Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
monica What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
ross What?
monica Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
ross What are you talking about?
monica The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
ross Okay, you are totally making this up.
monica How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
ross Oh God.
susan I've literally never been this happy.
monica Wasn't there a little song?
carol Oh please God, let there be a song.
ross There was no song. There was no song!
monica 'I am Bea.'
ross Okay.
monica 'I drink tea.'
ross Okay, that's, that's enough.
monica '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
ross Won't you dance around with me.
monica A-ha!!!
young_ross 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
young_monica Ross!!!
