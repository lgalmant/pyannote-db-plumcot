dr_ross_geller Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
chandler_bing Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
monica_geller What are you doing?!
chandler_bing Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
monica_geller Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
dr_ross_geller What the hell are doing?!!
rachel_green Hey, what's-what's going on?!
chandler_bing Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
joey_tribbiani Dude! He's right there!
dr_ross_geller I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
chandler_bing Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
monica_geller I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
dr_ross_geller My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
rachel_green Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
dr_ross_geller What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
rachel_green Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
dr_ross_geller You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
joey_tribbiani Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids
chandler_bing Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
joey_tribbiani I call Godfather!
dr_ross_geller You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
joey_tribbiani Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
monica_geller Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
chandler_bing Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
rachel_green Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
katie Hi!
all@ Hi!
joey_tribbiani So, are you ready to go?
katie Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
joey_tribbiani Oh sure, right back there.
katie Hey, where are we going to lunch?
joey_tribbiani I was thinking Chinese food.
katie Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
rachel_green She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
joey_tribbiani I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
monica_geller But what?
joey_tribbiani She keeps punching me.
monica_geller In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
monica_geller I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
chandler_bing Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
rachel_green Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
dr_ross_geller Aww.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
dr_ross_geller Huh.
phoebe_buffay Bread, so you never go hungry.
dr_ross_geller Ohh.
phoebe_buffay And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
gunther Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
gunther Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
dr_ross_geller Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
steve Oh hi Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Mr. President.
steve I came to talk to you about Howard.
dr_ross_geller Howard?
steve Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
dr_ross_geller Oh that's nice.
steve Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or
dr_ross_geller Oh. Uhh
steve Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
dr_ross_geller No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
steve Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
dr_ross_geller Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
steve Oh, okay, I get it.
dr_ross_geller No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
steve Howard's the handy man!
dr_ross_geller Yes but too me he's just, man.
steve Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
dr_ross_geller Ugh, can you believe that guy!
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I really like his glasses.
dr_ross_geller so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
chandler_bing Sounds like a fun party.
rachel_green Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
dr_ross_geller It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
rachel_green Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
dr_ross_geller Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
rachel_green And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
chandler_bing Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
rachel_green Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
chandler_bing Wh-wh-why?!
rachel_green Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
chandler_bing Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
rachel_green Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
chandler_bing I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
rachel_green No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
chandler_bing Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
rachel_green Not unless different means the same.
katie You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
joey_tribbiani Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
katie No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
joey_tribbiani Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
katie Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
monica_geller Isn't this great?
chandler_bing Hmm.
monica_geller Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
chandler_bing Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
monica_geller Are you okay?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
monica_geller What-what are you doing?
chandler_bing I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
monica_geller Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
chandler_bing What?!
monica_geller Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
chandler_bing Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
monica_geller Oh and you know what I want!
chandler_bing Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
monica_geller I do not have baby fever!
chandler_bing Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
monica_geller Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
chandler_bing Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
monica_geller You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
chandler_bing Well, I did not know that.
chandler_bing It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
chandler_bing By me?
dr_ross_geller Oh, no!
joey_tribbiani No-no.
dr_ross_geller Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, big!
joey_tribbiani Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
monica_geller Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
chandler_bing Monica.
monica_geller I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
chandler_bing Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
monica_geller Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
party_guest Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Oh, hi Ross!
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
guest_1 See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
dr_ross_geller You chipped in?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
phoebe_buffay No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
steve Oh hey, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
steve Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay, my bad.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi! Wow! You look, you look... big.
joey_tribbiani Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
rachel_green Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
joey_tribbiani Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
katie Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Hiya!
rachel_green Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
katie Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
rachel_green Oh! Ow!
katie Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
rachel_green Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
katie Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
rachel_green Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
katie You're so sweet!
rachel_green Ohh, you're so sweet!
katie Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
joey_tribbiani Huh.
katie Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
joey_tribbiani Uhh... .
katie You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
joey_tribbiani Nah.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay That's what I'm saying.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe? Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Ooh.
dr_ross_geller Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
phoebe_buffay No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
dr_ross_geller So uh, what did you tell them about me?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
dr_ross_geller Ohh.
phoebe_buffay But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
dr_ross_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, this cake is really good!
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
guest_2 Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
steve 3-B!
all@ Oh yeah, aww!
steve Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
guest_3 Yeah, leave!
all@ Yeah, get out! Now!
steve Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
phoebe_buffay All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
phoebe_buffay Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
dr_ross_geller Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
chandler_bing Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
monica_geller I'm Monica.
chandler_bing I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
monica_geller Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
chandler_bing Monica
monica_geller No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
chandler_bing Will you marry me?
dr_ross_geller Oh-no. No. No.
joey_tribbiani What a bad idea!
rachel_green Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
monica_geller Chandler, why are you doing this?
chandler_bing I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
monica_geller Chandler.
chandler_bing I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
monica_geller Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
chandler_bing No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
monica_geller Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
monica_geller Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
chandler_bing Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
monica_geller Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani She's right y'know.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
monica_geller Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
chandler_bing I didn't think I was!
monica_geller Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
chandler_bing Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
dr_ross_geller No, I will not!
joey_tribbiani Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
dr_ross_geller You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
phoebe_buffay Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
rachel_green Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
chandler_bing Okay, how long is this going to go on.
monica_geller Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
dr_ross_geller This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
chandler_bing That's not funny.
joey_tribbiani That's not funny at all!
