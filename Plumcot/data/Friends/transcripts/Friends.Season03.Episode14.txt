dr_ross_geller Yeah, huh.

rachel_green I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
dr_ross_geller Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?

phoebe_buffay Oh.
monica_geller Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
monica_geller Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
phoebe_buffay Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
monica_geller Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
phoebe_buffay You never run on a barge!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Is ah, is Chandler around?
monica_geller No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
joey_tribbiani Oooh.
monica_geller Yeah, Ginger something.
joey_tribbiani Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
monica_geller No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
joey_tribbiani Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
monica_geller Well, what did you do?
joey_tribbiani What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
monica_geller Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
joey_tribbiani All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
monica_geller You gave her food poisoning!?
joey_tribbiani I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
joey_tribbiani I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
monica_geller Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
joey_tribbiani I ran!!
chandler_bing Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
ginger Actually, me too.
chandler_bing Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
ginger Oh damn, I hate that.
chandler_bing Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
ginger Oh, don't worry about it.
chandler_bing No, really you're gonna freeze.
ginger No, I'm not.
chandler_bing You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
ginger Some day, maybe.
rachel_green Funny book?
dr_ross_geller Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
rachel_green Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
dr_ross_geller Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
rachel_green Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
dr_ross_geller Oh, well...
rachel_green Oh my God!!! Ross!!
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
rachel_green Because, he's my friend.
dr_ross_geller Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
rachel_green Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
dr_ross_geller Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
rachel_green I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
dr_ross_geller Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
rachel_green Really!?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
rachel_green Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
dr_ross_geller What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
monica_geller Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
phoebe_buffay It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
monica_geller Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
phoebe_buffay You think you know me so well.
monica_geller Well, don't 'cha wanna?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller Okay, well I do know you.
phoebe_buffay That's what I said.
monica_geller Well so?
phoebe_buffay I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
leslie My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
phoebe_buffay I stepped in something icky.
leslie@phoebe_buffay Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
lecturer#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode14 We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
dr_ross_geller I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
rachel_green Oh.
phoebe_buffay Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
leslie Wow, that's great.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah!
leslie Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
phoebe_buffay I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
leslie What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
leslie Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
lecturer#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode14 ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
monica_geller Hi!
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
chandler_bing Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
monica_geller So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
chandler_bing Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
monica_geller Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
chandler_bing Joey told you about the leg, huh?
monica_geller Uh-huh.
chandler_bing Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
joey_tribbiani Morning.
chandler_bing Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
joey_tribbiani Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
chandler_bing It came up.
joey_tribbiani Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
dr_ross_geller So I nodded off a little.
rachel_green Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
dr_ross_geller Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
rachel_green Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
dr_ross_geller First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
rachel_green Okay, see now, what I just heard
dr_ross_geller Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
rachel_green Oh, that is so...
dr_ross_geller No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
rachel_green Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
dr_ross_geller No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
rachel_green It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
dr_ross_geller That's a little clearer.
rachel_green Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
dr_ross_geller Sure, I-I-I...
ginger Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
chandler_bing No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
ginger It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is
chandler_bing No. No. I don't think so.
ginger Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
ginger What's that?
chandler_bing That's-that's my nubbin.
ginger What's a nubbin?
chandler_bing It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
ginger You have three nipples?
chandler_bing Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
ginger Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
chandler_bing You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
ginger Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
leslie Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
leslie I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
phoebe_buffay No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
leslie No, no, I don't want to forget it.
phoebe_buffay Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
commercial#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode14 Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
monica_geller Sorry, Pheebs.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. You okay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
monica_geller We'd love too.
phoebe_buffay Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
chandler_bing Well hello!
joey_tribbiani Where have you been?
chandler_bing The doctor.
dr_ross_geller Is everything okay?
chandler_bing Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
monica_geller Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
rachel_green What?!!
monica_geller Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
chandler_bing That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
