rachel Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
melissa So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
rachel Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
melissa Shut up!
rachel I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
melissa Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
rachel Oh please
melissa Are you?!
rachel No.
melissa Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?

melissa You do now. You're having dinner with me.
rachel Shut up.
melissa I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
rachel Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
melissa Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
rachel Wow! What do you do now?
melissa I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
rachel Okay!
joey Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
rachel Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
ross She seems really, really fun!
rachel She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
monica Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you
joey Who you what? Who you what?!
rachel Yes.
monica Wow!
joey Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
rachel It's not a big deal!
monica They were lovers.
ross What?!
joey What?!
rachel No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
ross So that's two of my wives.
monica Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
rachel Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
monica Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
chandler This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
monica Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
joey Hello!
rachel Hey!
joey Hey Rach.
rachel Stop picturing it!!
monica Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
joey Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
monica Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
joey What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
monica Why would they think they're invited?
joey You got me. I don't
monica Joey!
joey Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
monica Ross's parents are my parents!
joey Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
chandler Y'know I think we should invite them.
monica Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
chandler Well this is just sad!
monica All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
rachel That is not a problem.
joey Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
rachel Oh, get out of here!
rachel So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
chandler Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
rachel I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
chandler Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
rachel Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
chandler You mean like for award shows?
rachel Some of them.
chandler You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
rachel Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
chandler Okay, who wore those?
rachel Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
chandler Not bad.
rachel This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
chandler Who's that?
rachel He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
chandler Pierce Brosnan?
rachel Uh-huh.
chandler Are you serious?
rachel Yeah.
chandler 007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
rachel Yeah.
chandler Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
rachel It's a pretty cool tux.
chandler Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
joey We should really learn how to play the real way.
phoebe I like our way. Oh! Chess!
joey Nice move.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel Hey!
joey Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
joey No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
rachel Well, what are you going to wear?
joey Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
rachel Huh. Does Monica know about this?
joey I don't think so.
rachel Can I please be there when you tell her?
phoebe Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
rachel Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
joey Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
phoebe What is this? What's going on?
joey Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
rachel Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
phoebe Joey's!
joey Okay
rachel Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
phoebe Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
rachel It-it did!
phoebe Sure!
joey Hey. It happened!
rachel Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
phoebe Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
joey Why are you taking this away from me?
rachel Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
phoebe Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
rachel I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
phoebe Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
rachel Vanilla?!
phoebe Yeah.
rachel I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
phoebe To Ross.
rachel All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
phoebe Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
joey Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
ross Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
chandler A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
ross No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
chandler What?
ross That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
chandler You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
ross So?
chandler So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
ross Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
chandler Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
ross Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
chandler Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
ross When I got married you slept with my sister.
chandler That was pretty 007.
joey Hey.
monica Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
joey Yeah, they're not coming.
monica What?!
joey Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
monica Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
joey Look Mon, if you could just call my mom
monica Oh Joey!
joey Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
monica No she hasn't.
joey Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
monica Well, what am I going to say?
joey I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so
monica Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
melissa ...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
rachel Oh. Oh, that's great!
melissa Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
phoebe Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
melissa What one?
phoebe Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
melissa Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
rachel Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
melissa What?
rachel Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops
melissa Yeah?
rachel ...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
melissa Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
phoebe Really?!
chandler Ross is Batman!
monica Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
chandler Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
monica What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
chandler Batman has a utility belt!
monica 007 has a fancy car!
chandler Batman has the Batmobile!
monica 007 gets all the ladies.
chandler Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
monica How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
chandler Actually, I don't like martinis.
monica How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
chandler Ooh, yum!
joey Hey.
monica Hey.
joey Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
monica The show?!
joey Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
monica Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
joey Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
monica The wedding starts at six.
joey Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
monica You'll vamp?!
joey Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
rachel How can you not remember us kissing?!
melissa I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
rachel Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
phoebe Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
rachel Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
melissa I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
rachel No!!
phoebe Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
rachel Thank you Phoebe.
melissa She didn't.
phoebe I know.
ross Hey!
monica You just carry that around?
ross Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
monica Between you and
ross Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
chandler I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
monica A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
ross Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
chandler Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
ross What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
chandler Let me try it on!
ross Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
chandler Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
ross What?
chandler An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
ross Let me see that! Oh man!
chandler The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
joey Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
monica All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
joey No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
monica Oh.
chandler Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
joey Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
rachel It happened! I am telling you it happened!
melissa Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
rachel What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
melissa My God! You love me!
rachel What?
melissa Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have
rachel Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
melissa Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
rachel I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
melissa Shut up!
rachel I'm sorry!
melissa Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
rachel Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna
rachel What the hell was that?!
phoebe I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
rachel And?
phoebe I've had better.
chandler All right! I found one that fits!
rachel Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
chandler Whose is it?
rachel Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
chandler Whose is it?
rachel I don't want to say.
chandler Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
rachel Diane Keeton.
