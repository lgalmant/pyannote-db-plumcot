joey_tribbiani I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
dr_ross_geller She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
chandler_bing Any contact?
dr_ross_geller She lent me an egg once.
joey_tribbiani You're in!
dr_ross_geller Aw, right.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 Hi, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian - I don't think we need a third...
joey_tribbiani Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
dr_ross_geller An egg?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
chandler_bing I think it's winning.
dr_ross_geller I think it's insane.
chandler_bing She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
joey_tribbiani Think it'll work?
chandler_bing No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
monica_geller You can not do this.
rachel_green Do what, do what?
monica_geller Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
rachel_green No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
phoebe_buffay 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
monica_geller But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
rachel_green Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
joey_tribbiani Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
chandler_bing Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
chandler_bing Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
joey_tribbiani Pathetic mess? I know, but - come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
dr_ross_geller Hi. She said yes.
chandler_bing Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
joey_tribbiani How do I look?
chandler_bing Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
lorraine Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
chandler_bing ...And what did you bring?
lorraine She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
chandler_bing Janice?
janice Oh.... my.... God.
chandler_bing Hey, it's Janice.
chandler_bing Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
chandler_bing Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
joey_tribbiani Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
rachel_green Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
monica_geller Which one was Pete Carney?
rachel_green Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
monica_geller Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months - I didn't get to win once.
rachel_green How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
monica_geller I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
phoebe_buffay I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
monica_geller There's more beer, right?
phoebe_buffay Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
rachel_green Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
monica_geller Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
phoebe_buffay Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
rachel_green Or?
phoebe_buffay Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
monica_geller Burning's good.
rachel_green Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
lorraine You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
joey_tribbiani Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
janice By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
chandler_bing That's OK.
janice Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
joey_tribbiani We can't do that.
chandler_bing What? What can't you do?
joey_tribbiani Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
joey_tribbiani Uh, we might be leaving now.
chandler_bing Tell me it's "you and me" we.
joey_tribbiani She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
chandler_bing Ok, you can not do this to me.
joey_tribbiani You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
lorraine Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
joey_tribbiani I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
chandler_bing I hope she throws up on you.
chandler_bing So...
janice Just us.
chandler_bing Oh, what a crappy night!
janice Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
chandler_bing Excuse me. How ya doin'?
janice So, do we have the best friends or what?
chandler_bing Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
janice I will go for that drink.
chandler_bing You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
janice Each.
chandler_bing That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
janice Happy Valentine's Day!
janice Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
chandler_bing No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
janice Kiss me!
monica_geller Oh, Chandler, sorry.
monica_geller Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
janice Hi, Monica.
chandler_bing Ok, well, this was very special.
monica_geller Rach, come see who's out here!
rachel_green Oh my god. Janice, hi!
chandler_bing Janice is gonna go away now.
monica_geller I'll be right back.
rachel_green Oh, Joey, look who it is.
joey_tribbiani Whoa.
chandler_bing Oh, good, Joey's home now.
janice This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
monica_geller Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
janice Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
dr_ross_geller I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
kristen That's funny. Who are they?
dr_ross_geller The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
kristen You mean they're lovers.
dr_ross_geller If you wanna put a label on it.
kristen Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
dr_ross_geller Nope, nope, that's it.
dr_ross_geller Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
phoebe_buffay Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
monica_geller All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
phoebe_buffay Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
rachel_green Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
monica_geller Can we just start throwing things in?
phoebe_buffay Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
rachel_green Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
phoebe_buffay Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
monica_geller Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
rachel_green Hey he's wearing a sweater.
monica_geller No.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Eww!
rachel_green And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
monica_geller Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
chandler_bing How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
chandler_bing Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
janice Hello, funny Valentine.
chandler_bing Hi, Just Janice.
janice Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
joey_tribbiani If you don't do it, I will.
dr_ross_geller So, um, what do you do for a living?
kristen Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
carol_willick Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
susan_bunch I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
kristen I guess.
dr_ross_geller Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
carol_willick Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
dr_ross_geller Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
fireman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 What do we got there?
fireman_no_2#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 A piece of something
monica_geller You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
fireman_no_3#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
fireman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 You're our third call tonight.
rachel_green Really?
fireman_no_2#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
janice I brought you something.
chandler_bing Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
janice I had them made special.
chandler_bing Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
janice That's fine.
chandler_bing It is?
janice Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
chandler_bing Oh no, you see, actually it is.
janice No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
chandler_bing Oh, no I don't.
janice Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
chandler_bing I did, but...
janice You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
chandler_bing Call me!
carol_willick It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
dr_ross_geller You did so. I swear, I swear - How long has she been in the bathroom?
carol_willick Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
dr_ross_geller Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
carol_willick That could be it.
dr_ross_geller Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
carol_willick Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
dr_ross_geller No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
carol_willick Oh, I love you too. But...
dr_ross_geller No but, no but.
carol_willick You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
dr_ross_geller That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
carol_willick All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
carol_willick Not her.
fireman_no_3#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
rachel_green So, um, will you bring the truck?
fireman_no_3#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 I'll even let you ring the bell.
rachel_green Oh, my god.
phoebe_buffay See, there you go, the cleansing works!
monica_geller They're nice guys.
rachel_green Oh, they're firemen guys.
fireman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 You guys tell them you were married?
fireman_no_2#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 No way!
fireman_no_3#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode14 Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
