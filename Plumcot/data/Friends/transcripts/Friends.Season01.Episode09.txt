rachel_green Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
terry An advance?
rachel_green It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
terry Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
rachel_green Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
rachel_green Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode09 Huh?
rachel_green Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
monica_geller Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
dr_ross_geller No, they're not.
monica_geller Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
dr_ross_geller You're wrong.
monica_geller I am not wrong.
dr_ross_geller You're wrong.
monica_geller No, I just talked to them.
dr_ross_geller I'm calling Mom.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
chandler_bing And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
joey_tribbiani Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
chandler_bing That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
phoebe_buffay What were you modeling for?
joey_tribbiani You know those posters for the city free clinic?
monica_geller Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
phoebe_buffay You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
chandler_bing Do you know which one you're gonna be?
joey_tribbiani No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
chandler_bing Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
joey_tribbiani Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
monica_geller Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
dr_ross_geller Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
monica_geller You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
monica_geller And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
chandler_bing Yes, every single one of them.
monica_geller Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
phoebe_buffay Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
monica_geller So you're free Thursday, then.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Oh, can I come?
monica_geller Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
rachel_green Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
chandler_bing I thought it was $98.50.
rachel_green Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm off to Carol's.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
dr_ross_geller Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
dr_ross_geller Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
susan_bunch No, she's at a faculty meeting.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
susan_bunch What's it look like?
dr_ross_geller Kinda like a big face without skin.
susan_bunch Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
dr_ross_geller Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
susan_bunch Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
susan_bunch Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
dr_ross_geller The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
susan_bunch What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
dr_ross_geller You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
susan_bunch Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
dr_ross_geller Do you uh, do you talk about me?
susan_bunch Yeah, yeah, all the time.
dr_ross_geller Really?
susan_bunch But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
dr_ross_geller Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
chandler_bing I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
monica_geller Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
rachel_green No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
monica_geller Rach, here's your mail.
rachel_green Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
monica_geller No, here's your mail.
rachel_green Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
monica_geller Would you just open it?
rachel_green Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
monica_geller We all chipped in.
joey_tribbiani We did?
monica_geller You owe me 20 bucks.
rachel_green Thank you. Thank you so much!
monica_geller Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
rachel_green Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
chandler_bing All right, I'm nine years old.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I hate this story.
chandler_bing We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
rachel_green Oh my god.
chandler_bing Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
joey_tribbiani Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
obsession_girl We did?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
obsession_girl Yeah, right.
joey_tribbiani I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
obsession_girl Get out.
joey_tribbiani I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
obsession_girl Really? You don't know what that means to me.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
obsession_girl Nothing.
joey_tribbiani Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
obsession_girl Yeah. Oh.
joey_tribbiani What's wrong?
obsession_girl I just remembered, I have to do something.
joey_tribbiani Oh. What?
obsession_girl Um, leave.
joey_tribbiani Wait, wait, wait!
joey_tribbiani So I guess you all saw it.
rachel_green Saw what?
phoebe_buffay No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
joey_tribbiani Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
chandler_bing Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
monica_geller Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
monica_geller All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
dr_ross_geller That's closer.
rachel_green I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
chandler_bing Oh, you must stop shooping.
rachel_green Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
joey_tribbiani Chandler, will you just come in already?
chandler_bing No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
phoebe_buffay Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
chandler_bing Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
monica_geller That's not a question.
joey_tribbiani But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
monica_geller All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
dr_ross_geller Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
monica_geller Ah!
dr_ross_geller Ok, Mom never hit.
phoebe_buffay Ok, all done.
monica_geller What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
monica_geller Why would we do that?
phoebe_buffay Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
monica_geller Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
rachel_green Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
chandler_bing The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
joey_tribbiani The balloon?
chandler_bing No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
rachel_green I can't, I gotta go.
chandler_bing Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
phoebe_buffay Almost never.
monica_geller Got the keys? or Got the keys!
rachel_green Ok.
carol_willick Anytime you're ready.
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
carol_willick Just aim for the bump.
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
carol_willick So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
dr_ross_geller Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
rachel_green I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
monica_geller Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
rachel_green We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
monica_geller No I don't.
rachel_green Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
monica_geller No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
rachel_green No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
chandler_bing Do either of you have the keys?
monica_geller The oven is on.
rachel_green Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
joey_tribbiani Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
monica_geller Well then get it, get it!
joey_tribbiani That tone will not make me go any faster.
monica_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani That one will.
dr_ross_geller And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
carol_willick Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
dr_ross_geller Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
susan_bunch Hi, how's it goin?
dr_ross_geller Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
carol_willick I did.
dr_ross_geller Does it always, uh--?
carol_willick No, no that was the first.
susan_bunch Keep singing! Keep singing!
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
susan_bunch I felt it!
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
joey_tribbiani Nope, not that one.
monica_geller Can you go any faster with that?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
monica_geller Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
chandler_bing For an emergency just like this.
rachel_green All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
monica_geller I swear you said you had the keys.
rachel_green No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
monica_geller Why would I have the keys?
rachel_green Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
monica_geller But I didn't.
rachel_green Well, you should have.
monica_geller Why?
rachel_green Because!
monica_geller Why?
rachel_green Because!
monica_geller Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
chandler_bing Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
monica_geller Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
dr_ross_geller Here we come, walkin' down the-this doesn't smell like Mom's.
monica_geller No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
rachel_green Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
joey_tribbiani Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
monica_geller Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
joey_tribbiani You call that delicious?
monica_geller Stop it, stop it, stop it!
chandler_bing Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
phoebe_buffay Ooh.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
joey_tribbiani I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
monica_geller Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
phoebe_buffay It's nice that he has someone.
chandler_bing Shall I carve?
rachel_green By all means.
chandler_bing Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
dr_ross_geller I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
monica_geller Does anybody wanna split this with me?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I will.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
monica_geller Make a wish?
phoebe_buffay Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
joey_tribbiani The bigger half.
chandler_bing I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
all@ That's so sweet.
dr_ross_geller And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
rachel_green And a crappy New Year.
chandler_bing Here, here!
