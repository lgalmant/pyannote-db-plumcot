joey Hey.
chandler Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
joey Sure, neighbor come on in.
chandler So, is Janine around?
joey Uh, no, she's at dance class.
chandler Can I check out what she did to my room?
joey Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
chandler Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
joey It is???
chandler Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
joey No.
chandler Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
joey No.
chandler No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
joey All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
chandler Yes talk to her. Be a man.
joey I'm a man.
chandler Defend yourself.
joey Hmm.
monica Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
chandler Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
monica Hey guys.
chandler Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
monica It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
chandler Ohh, yeah.
ross Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
monica Yeah.
ross The one that always stares at me when I come in?
monica No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
ross Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
rachel Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
phoebe Hey.
rachel Hey.
phoebe Rachel?
rachel Yeah.
phoebe I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
rachel Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
phoebe Oh my God. What happened?
rachel I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
phoebe Well that's great! Congratulations!!
rachel Yeah. A year ago..
phoebe You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
rachel But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
chandler That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
monica I don't think mine likes me either.
ross Maybe it's a universal thing?
joey Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
chandler Yeah let's head off to work.
monica We should go.
phoebe Thank you.
rachel Sure.
phoebe Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
rachel Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
phoebe Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
rachel What? What!?! You kissed him?
phoebe Totally.
rachel Phoebe are you serious?
phoebe Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
rachel Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
phoebe No!
rachel Phoebe
phoebe What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
janine Hey Joey.
joey Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
janine No, I just thought it was cute.
joey Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
janine Ohh. Like what?
joey Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
janine Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
joey Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
janine Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
joey Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
janine Well I just thought
joey I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
janine It's a curling iron.
joey Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
janine It's clean.
joey Yeah, well, it feels different.
janine It's dry.
joey Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
janine No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
joey Well that's like summer in a bowl.
rachel Oh, Kim, Hi.
kim Uhh-huh.
rachel So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
kim I didn't read it.
rachel Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
kim Yeah.
rachel So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
kim Tell me everything.
ross Hey guys.
chandler_and_monica Hey.
ross What's up?
chandler You know...Oh My God.
monica What happened to your teeth.
ross I whitened them.
chandler Really.
ross Yeah. What do you think.
monica Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
ross Come on, seriously.
monica Ross they're really, really, really white.
chandler Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
ross Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
monica How much longer?
ross A-A day.
monica Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
ross I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
chandler No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
monica She will be after tonight.
chandler Yeah.
ross Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
rachel Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
chandler What???
monica Oh my god.
rachel Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
chandler I am proud of all my friends today.
monica My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
chandler Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
monica Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
chandler Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
phoebe Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
rachel That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
phoebe That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
rachel What?
phoebe Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
rachel Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
phoebe What?
rachel Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
phoebe Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
rachel To get you to make out with him!!!
phoebe Ohhh.
monica Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
ross I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
monica Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
ross Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
monica I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
ross Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
monica Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
ross But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
monica Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
ross What??
monica All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
ross No. I am not putting on makeup.
phoebe Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
monica Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
chandler Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
monica Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
chandler Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
monica You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
chandler Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
monica Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
chandler You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
monica When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
joey Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
chandler No thanks, Josephine.
chandler Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
rachel Ohh, hi, Kim.
kim Hi Rachel.
rachel Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
kim You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
rachel Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
kim That's not true?
rachel No.
kim Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
rachel Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
kim Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
rachel I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
kim Hi Ralph.
ralph_lauren : Hi Kim.
kim Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
hillary And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
ross Mmm-Hmm.
hillary And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
ross Mmm.
hillary You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
ross Mm-Hmm.
hillary After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
ross Hmm-Hmm.
hillary I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
ross Mmm-Unmm.
hillary Come on. I want to know.
ross Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
joey So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
monica Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
chandler Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
monica Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
joey Ohh, I love birds.
chandler What is the matter with you ?!?
joey What?
chandler You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
joey Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
chandler You're turning into a women.
joey No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
chandler Now I've upset you? What did I say?
joey It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a women!!!
rachel Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
phoebe But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
rachel I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
phoebe Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
rachel You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
phoebe Just for a second.
rachel Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
phoebe Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
rachel I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
phoebe Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
rachel That wouldn't help me.
phoebe Ohh, yes it would.
hillary I've had a really good time tonight.
ross Mmm.
hillary You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
ross Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
hillary Are you going to eat that bread?
ross Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
hillary You make me laugh.
ross Hmm-Hmm.
hillary Would you like to move over to the couch?
ross Mmm-Hmm.
hillary Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
ross How about all the way.
hillary Okay.
ross Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
hillary Are those your teeth??
ross Ohh, you can see them, huh?
hillary Yes. They're insanely white.
ross I-I, did that for you.
hillary What's a matter with you?
ross What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
rachel Kim, hi.
kim Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
rachel Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
kim Oh, really?
rachel Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
kim You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
ralph_lauren : Hi Kim.
kim Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
rachel Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
kim Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
rachel You and Ralph?
kim Kenny the copyboy.
janine Hey.
joey Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
janine What's the matter? Are you upset?
joey I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
janine Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
joey Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
janine Okay.
joey And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
janine Sure.
joey And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
janine Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
joey Okay.
