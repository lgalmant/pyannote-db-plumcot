joey_tribbiani That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!

dr_ross_geller I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!!
rachel_green Joey! Joey!

joey_tribbiani Really?!
rachel_green Yes!
joey_tribbiani Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
rachel_green Oh, okay!
joey_tribbiani Oh my, oh my God!
rachel_green Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
joey_tribbiani Mia Hamm?
rachel_green Mia Hamm!
joey_tribbiani Oh that's amazing.
rachel_green Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
joey_tribbiani Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
chandler_bing Hey babe.
monica_geller Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
chandler_bing Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
monica_geller No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
chandler_bing How about to the street say from the balcony?
monica_geller Why don't we just find a place for it?
chandler_bing Okay. How about in that cabinet?
monica_geller No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
chandler_bing How about the closet by the bathroom?
monica_geller Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
monica_geller No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
chandler_bing Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
monica_geller Feminine stuff.
chandler_bing Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
monica_geller Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.
chandler_bing Fine.
monica_geller Thank you!
chandler_bing Love you.
phoebe_buffay Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!
chandler_bing Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
phoebe_buffay Why won't you let me massage you?
monica_geller Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
phoebe_buffay Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
monica_geller That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
phoebe_buffay I'm curious about the human body.
monica_geller Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
phoebe_buffay But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
monica_geller Okay, if it means that much to you
phoebe_buffay It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
monica_geller Dinosaurs.
phoebe_buffay Potato, potaato.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
dr_ross_geller What?! It is?!
rachel_green It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
dr_ross_geller Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
rachel_green Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping
joey_tribbiani A dreamless sleep.
dr_ross_geller My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I...kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
joey_tribbiani Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
dr_ross_geller Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
joey_tribbiani Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
phoebe_buffay Are you under the sheet?
monica_geller Yes.
phoebe_buffay Great, let's begin. How's the pressure?
monica_geller Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
phoebe_buffay Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
monica_geller No. Ooohh
phoebe_buffay That's right, you just enjoy.
monica_geller Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Oh God Phoebe!! Oh that's it! That's it! Right there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh
chandler_bing I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!
joey_tribbiani Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
chandler_bing Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
chandler_bing I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
joey_tribbiani I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
chandler_bing Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
joey_tribbiani Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
chandler_bing And here we go
joey_tribbiani I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!
rachel_green Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
joey_tribbiani Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
rachel_green Really?
joey_tribbiani Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
rachel_green Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!
joey_tribbiani Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!
joey_tribbiani Hey! So?
dr_long She's fine. She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
rachel_green Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
joey_tribbiani So but everything is normal.
dr_long Absolutely.
joey_tribbiani And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
dr_long No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are, but she's fine.
rachel_green Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
joey_tribbiani Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
rachel_green But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
joey_tribbiani Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
rachel_green But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
joey_tribbiani You sure?!
rachel_green Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?
joey_tribbiani Oh hey-hey!
dr_ross_geller Is everything okay?
rachel_green Yeah, everything's fine!
dr_ross_geller Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
joey_tribbiani Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
rachel_green Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
joey_tribbiani Hey uh, what's with the candy?
dr_ross_geller Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
rachel_green Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
dr_ross_geller No I-Mona!
rachel_green Oh, I gotta go back in there.
dr_ross_geller What? Why? What's wrong?
rachel_green No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back
dr_ross_geller No really, you tell me what's up.
rachel_green I-I forgot my underwear.
dr_ross_geller So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
dr_ross_geller Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me. I'm the dad.
dr_long Uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on Braxton-Hicks. Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You're gonna make a wonderful father.
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
chandler_bing There has got to be a way!
joey_tribbiani Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
chandler_bing Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
joey_tribbiani Then why do you throw like one?
chandler_bing Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
joey_tribbiani Sure. "Monica."
chandler_bing So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
joey_tribbiani Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
chandler_bing That's a good idea.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I just...I feel terrible.
chandler_bing Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
monica_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
phoebe_buffay No-no, I got that.
monica_geller So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay I mean $500.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay 600.
monica_geller What's going on?
phoebe_buffay Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
monica_geller What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
phoebe_buffay Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
monica_geller Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!
phoebe_buffay No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
monica_geller Really?!
phoebe_buffay Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
monica_geller Are you sure?
phoebe_buffay Yes.
monica_geller I guess.
phoebe_buffay Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
rachel_green Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
dr_ross_geller Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
rachel_green Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
dr_ross_geller Well yeah!
rachel_green Oh Ross!!
dr_ross_geller What?! What?! Rach what?!
joey_tribbiani What's going on?
dr_ross_geller I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
joey_tribbiani Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
dr_ross_geller I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
rachel_green Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
joey_tribbiani I'm on it!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
joey_tribbiani Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
rachel_green Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
joey_tribbiani Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green What's up?
joey_tribbiani Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
rachel_green Are you breaking up with us?
joey_tribbiani The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So
rachel_green Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Maybe you two should live together.
rachel_green Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that...if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father.
rachel_green But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.
dr_ross_geller No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
rachel_green But Ross, its you and me!
dr_ross_geller So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
joey_tribbiani All right now, so? What do you think?
rachel_green I don't know. Is it crazy?
dr_ross_geller No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
joey_tribbiani Well, I was due.
rachel_green Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
dr_ross_geller Really?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Oh Rach that's great. That's great.
chandler_bing Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
monica_geller How did you get in there?!
chandler_bing You're messy.
monica_geller Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
chandler_bing I married Fred Sanford!
monica_geller No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.
chandler_bing No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
monica_geller Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?
chandler_bing Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
monica_geller Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
joey_tribbiani Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
chandler_bing Are you okay?
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
monica_geller Ohhh.
phoebe_buffay That's it. Just relax.
monica_geller Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
phoebe_buffay Come on more!
monica_geller Oh God!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you like that don't you?
monica_geller Oh yeah right there!
phoebe_buffay You want it there? You take it there baby!
monica_geller Uh Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
