jay_leno Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
joey All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
chandler We're very happy for you.
joey What's the matter?!
chandler We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know
joey All right, I'll take care of it.
monica Oh no, wait! Joey!
ross 73! 72! 71!
joey Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
ross What?
joey Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
ross Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
joey Chandler.
ross Awww, man! Really?
joey Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
ross That's a good point.
joey Yeah.
ross Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
joey Okay, great!
ross All right.
joey Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
phoebe It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
joey Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
rachel What?!
ross Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
rachel So?
joey So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
rachel Oh, good point.
joey Yeah!
all 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
chandler Happy New Year!
monica Happy New Year.
ross Happy New Year, Pheebs!
phoebe You too!
rachel Happy New Year, Joey!
joey So did that do anything for ya?
ross Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
rachel But your divorce isn't even final yet.
ross Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
chandler Do you want us to leave the room, or?
ross Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
phoebe Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
chandler That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
phoebe Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
monica She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
ross In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
chandler I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
joey All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
ross Ohh.
phoebe Really?! How come?
joey Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
phoebe Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
joey Really? Who-who have you taught?
phoebe Well, I taught me and I love me.
joey Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
rachel Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
monica Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
rachel I don't gossip!
rachel Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
monica Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
rachel What? They were like this!
woman I'll see you tomorrow.
ross Okay! Hey!
chandler_and_joey Hey!
ross I just asked that girl out.
chandler Nice!
joey Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
ross Yes it is. See.
chandler Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
ross That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
chandler Horn-swoggle.
joey You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
chandler No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
joey Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
ross Hi, Pheebs!
phoebe Hey!
ross Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
phoebe Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
ross All right, see you later.
joey See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
phoebe Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
joey Umm, okay.
phoebe Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
chandler What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
phoebe Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
rachel I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
joey Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
phoebe Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
joey Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
phoebe Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
joey No.
phoebe Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
joey Yes!
phoebe Then don't touch one!!
ross Hi!
ben Hi!
monica Hi Ben!
ben Auntie Monica!!
chandler Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
rachel I think they're very nice.
monica I like 'em.
joey Yeah!
monica I like them a lot.
chandler That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
ross Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
chandler Oh come on!!
ross Okay, seriously, what do you think?
joey You look like a freak.
rachel Awful, absolutely awful.
ross What are you, what are you doing?
monica It's my New Year's resolution!
ross What, to blind my child?
monica No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
joey Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
ross My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
elizabeth_hornswoggle No.
ross Okay, it must just be me then.
ross That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
elizabeth No, go ahead.
ross Thanks.
ross Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
elizabeth Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
ross 'Kay!
ross Oh my God!
phoebe Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
joey Yes! Yes, I did.
phoebe Then do Iceberg!
joey G-sharp.
phoebe G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
joey What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
phoebe No, but you're questioning my method!
joey No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
monica Thank you.
phoebe Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
joey Your other student, was you!
phoebe Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
joey Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
phoebe Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
rachel "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
phoebe Oh, fine! Take his side!
monica I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
chandler Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
monica Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
rachel Arghh!!
joey Hello?
ross Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
joey Uhh, Chandler's not here.
ross Well, you can help me!
joey Okay.
ross Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
joey Nice!
ross No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
joey Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
ross Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
joey Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
ross Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
joey Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
ross Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
joey Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
ross Hold on.
joey Ross? You okay?
ross They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
joey Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
ross What difference does that make?!
joey Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
rachel Joey, do you have a minute?
ross Dude, what am I gonna
joey Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
rachel Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
joey Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
rachel Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
joey What-what is it, what is it?
rachel Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
joey Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
rachel Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
joey I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
rachel What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
joey And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
rachel I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
joey I'm not listening to you!
elizabeth Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
ross All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
elizabeth No, let's just leave the lights on.
elizabeth Oh my God!
ross I had a problem.
joey Hey, Pheebs?
phoebe No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
joey Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
phoebe Uh-huh!
joey Wow! Cool!
joey Was the chord at least right
phoebe No!
chandler Oh my God!
monica We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
ross This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
all No. No, you're not a loser.
ross Look at me!
monica Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
ross Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
monica See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
phoebe Yeah!
rachel That really is something; that's really cool.
joey Howdy partner!
ross Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
monica Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
chandler Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
phoebe Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
rachel Good luck, honey!
phoebe Bye!
rachel Hey, uh, Joey?
joey Umm?
rachel Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
joey Oh, no!
rachel I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
joey Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
rachel Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
joey Now? You want me to go over there now?
rachel Yeah!
joey Do you know something?
rachel Do you know something?
joey I might know something.
rachel I might know something too.
joey What's the thing you know?
rachel Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
joey I can't tell you what I know.
rachel Well then I can't tell you what I know.
joey Okay, fine.
joey You don't know!
rachel All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!

chandler Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
