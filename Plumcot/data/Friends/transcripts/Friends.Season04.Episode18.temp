phoebe Hey!
chandler Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
phoebe Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
chandler All right.
phoebe Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
joey Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
phoebe I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
alice Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
phoebe Hey! What are you doing here?
alice Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
phoebe Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
alice No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
chandler Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
alice Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
phoebe Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
alice You think about it.
emily I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
ross Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
emily Ohh, it's time to go.
ross Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
emily Well that's ambitious.
ross Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
emily That's Carol with your son!
ross Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
carol Ross!
ross I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
susan Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
emily Me too!
carol Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
susan Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
emily Oh, well, I'll show you around.
susan That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions
emily Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
susan Ahh!
ross Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
emily Are you all right?
susan Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
ross Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
phoebe Hi!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
phoebe Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
chandler Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
joey Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
phoebe No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
joey Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
chandler Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
joey Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
chandler Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
joey What do ya say? What do ya say?
phoebe Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
joey I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
rachel Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
monica Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
rachel Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
monica Um-hmm.
rachel What am I making him by the way?
monica Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
rachel I thought I was making him filet mignon?
monica Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
rachel Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
ross Hey!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross So uh, Emily called last night
chandler And now you're giving me the message!
ross Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
phoebe God, Susan is so fun!
ross Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
chandler You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
ross Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
joey No, but I'm gonna!
chandler Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
ross How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
phoebe Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
ross What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
phoebe No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
ross Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
phoebe Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know
ross Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
phoebe So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
joey Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
chandler Raymond Chandler.
joey Someone you didn't make up!
chandler Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
joey Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
phoebe Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
chandler Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
joey All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
chandler Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
joey I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
chandler Okay.
joey So I guess it's Joey then!
joshua This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
rachel Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
joshua Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
rachel Hmmm!
joshua Oh my God!
rachel Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
joshua Behind you?
rachel Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
joshua Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
rachel Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
joey Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
rachel All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
joshua Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
rachel Oh.
joshua So, all right.
rachel Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
joshua Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
rachel But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
joshua Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
rachel Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
joshua Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
rachel Your parents'?
joshua Yeah, they're out of town.
rachel Ohh.
joshua Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
rachel Yeah that works.
joshua They-they-they can smell fear.
ross Hey!
carol Hey! How's Ben?
ross Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
carol Hey, Ben! Hey!
ross So umm, any word from Susan?
carol Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
ross Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
carol What's too much fun?
ross Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
carol Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
ross Am I?!
carol Yes!
ross Am I?!
carol I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
ross Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
carol Maybe.
ross OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
joshua ...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
rachel Wow! This place is fabulous!
joshua Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
rachel Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
joshua Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
rachel Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
joshua Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
rachel That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
joshua Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
rachel Ah.
mrs_burgin Oh, hi, darling!
joshua Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
mrs_burgin Oh, well we cut the trip short.
mr_burgin France sucks!
joshua Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
mrs_burgin Oh, say no more!
mr_burgin We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
joshua Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
mr_burgin Yep, sucks!
rachel Hi you!
joshua Oh my God!
rachel I know, I can do more than cook.
mr_burgin I like her. She sees smart.
joshua Uhh, Rachel, my parents
rachel Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
mr_burgin Hi.
rachel Hello.
mrs_burgin Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
rachel What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
mrs_burgin Maybe in L.A?
rachel Yes!
joshua There you go.
mr_burgin So, have you kids eaten yet?
rachel Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
mr_burgin Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
rachel Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
mr_burgin So... We go eat.
rachel Yes.
mr_burgin You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
joey Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
chandler No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
joey It's not that bad.
chandler Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
joey So, you're just Bing?
chandler I have no name.
phoebe All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
chandler Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
joey No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
chandler Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
phoebe Umm, Gene.
chandler It's Clint. It's Clint!
joey See you later, Gene.
phoebe Bye, Gene.
chandler It's Clint! Clint!
joey What's up with Gene?
monica So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
rachel Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
phoebe Oh my God!
monica Oh, no!
rachel No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
ross So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
rachel So?
ross So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
monica Emily's straight.
ross Oh, wake up!
phoebe Wow, Carol really messed you up!
ross Excuse me?
phoebe Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
ross Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
rachel Huh.
ross What?
rachel She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
monica This totally makes sense!
ross It does not!
monica Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
phoebe All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
rachel Absolutely! Absolutely!
monica This is so much fun!
ross This is not fun!
monica Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
phoebe Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
ross Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
rachel What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
phoebe Drum roll.
chandler Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
joey Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
chandler All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
phoebe You're actually going through with this?
chandler Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
phoebe You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
chandler Really?!
phoebe Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
chandler Okay. Thanks.
phoebe Okay!
chandler You wanna hug it out?
phoebe Yeah!
phoebe Yay!
chandler Yay!
phoebe Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
chandler Okay!
phoebe Ooh, uh
chandler Bye, Pheebs!
phoebe Okay, bye!
chandler Ha! Ha! Ha!
joey Ohh!
ross Nice luggage.
carol I was gonna say
susan Hey!
ross Hi!
emily Hey! I missed you.
ross Oh, I missed you too.
susan Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
emily Oh, so did I.
ross No tongue.
