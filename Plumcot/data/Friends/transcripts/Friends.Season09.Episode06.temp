chandler Hello? Hello?
monica I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
chandler Honey, you're screaming.
monica YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
chandler Oh, that's great.
monica Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
chandler Awesome.
monica Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
mike This is nice.
phoebe I know!
mike You need both hands for that?
phoebe Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?
joey Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh
phoebe I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
mike Is it?
phoebe Maybe not, is it?
mike Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
phoebe I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
mike Oh, sorry.
phoebe Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
mike It's to my apartment.
phoebe Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
mike Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
phoebe Oh no, I want to.
mike Oh, thank God.
phoebe Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
mike Is this cool, huh?
phoebe It really is.
joey Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
rachel So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
prospective_nanny I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better.
rachel That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
prospective_nanny Not really.
rachel Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
ross Thank you.
rachel Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
prospective_nanny Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing?
ross Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
prospective_nanny That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
rachel Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
ross Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
rachel What, the blonde with no bra?
ross She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
rachel Okay...
sandy Hi... I'm Sandy.
ross And she's a little mannish...
phoebe Oh my God! David!
david Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
phoebe No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
david Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
phoebe Who cares, it got you here.
david Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
phoebe Wow. Where is your luggage?
david Damn it!
phoebe A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
david Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
phoebe Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
david Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone?
phoebe No...
phoebe I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
monica Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
phoebe He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
monica Oh, well... That had been your window.
phoebe Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
monica Really? The scientist guy?
phoebe Really? Chandler?
monica Continue...
phoebe Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
monica Phoebe!
phoebe I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
monica Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
phoebe Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
monica What are you gonna do?
phoebe I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
monica You have to tell David!
phoebe Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
chandler Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!
monica Heeeeeey!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hey!
chandler So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
monica Was your cabin pressurised?
chandler And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
phoebe Okay.
chandler What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
monica No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
chandler Yeah, he came up...
monica Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
chandler Were you there?
phoebe No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
sandy I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...
rachel Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
ross Are you gay?
rachel Ross!
sandy It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
rachel Oh!
sandy Her name is Deliah.
rachel Oh, that's pretty.
ross So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
sandy I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.
ross Okay.
sandy Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in...
ross Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
rachel Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
sandy Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
rachel Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
ross Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
rachel So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
ross Because, it's weird!
rachel Why?
ross What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
rachel Yes?
ross King?
sandy I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...
rachel Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
sandy That's great! I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
rachel Oooh... '''I really can't hear what she says''' come here.
ross You gotta be at least bi...
chandler Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
joey Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
chandler Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
joey I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
chandler Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
joey Seriously? She actually said that?
chandler Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
joey Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
chandler Yeah!
joey Without that, you just got "lame with women".
chandler Ye....
monica Hi! There you are.
joey Fire trucks!
david Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
phoebe Oof...
david In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.
phoebe Oh, wait, wait!
david Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
phoebe No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His.. his name is Mike.
david Oh... oh...
phoebe Yeah, I should have told you.
david No... well, yeah.
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
david Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?
phoebe I am happy.
david Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...
phoebe Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
david Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
phoebe Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
david No... no...
phoebe I mean...
david In Minsk...
phoebe Yeah?
david ..it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.
phoebe Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
rachel Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
ross Is everything allright?
rachel Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
sandy Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
rachel I can't... I can't hear it again.
sandy You know, I can't tell it again...
ross And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
rachel Yeah! Excuse me...
ross Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
rachel Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
ross Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
rachel What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
ross Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing!
rachel Sandy made Madeleines.
ross This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
rachel Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
ross Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
rachel Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
phoebe Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
david But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
phoebe No, no. No.
david But... ergo...
phoebe Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
david Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui...
mike Well... hey, the key works...!
phoebe And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
ross Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
monica Yeah! I think that's great!
ross Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
monica Oh... How are they?
ross Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
joey Hey!
ross Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
joey Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
ross Thank you!
joey That's like a woman wanting to be a...
ross ..a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
monica Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
joey Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
monica Yeah, so?
ross Wow!
joey Really? Do you not know Chandler?
monica Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
joey So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
ross Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
joey ..No...
monica I can't believe he's that upset about this...
joey Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
chandler Hey!
joey Heeeyy! Hey!
chandler What are you guys talking about?
ross Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
chandler You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
chandler You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
monica Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
chandler If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
monica Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
chandler What is so funny about that?
monica Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
chandler Did you tell her what we talked about?
joey Yeah....
chandler So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
monica Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
chandler Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
monica Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
chandler I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
monica Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.
ross Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
joey Not knowing when to shut up...
ross Yep! That's my thing...
mike So... how many guys have your key?
phoebe No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
mike Your lipstick's on his mouth.
david Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
phoebe No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
mike Did you uhm...
phoebe No, no...
mike ..kiss him?
phoebe Oh, well, yeah...
david Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.
mike Don't point your finger at me.
david Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
mike Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...
phoebe Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.
david Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... well, you just better watch out.
mike Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
david Oh, you're going to Minsk?
mike Well, I might.
david Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
phoebe Okay, well... guys?
david Right... Goodbye Phoebe.
mike Hey, what are you kidding me?
david Right-o, right-o... Take good care of her.
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
mike It's never gonna happen again right?
phoebe Right! Never! Never! I swear!
david I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style.
joey Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
ross Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
joey Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
ross I swear to God...!
sandy Who's up for puppets?
joey Me! I'm up for puppets!
sandy Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
ross Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
sandy Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.
joey I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
ross Oh my God!
sandy Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus...
rachel That was kind of rude!
ross Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
rachel You know, he was just doing his job...
ross Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
rachel Oh, come on Ross...
ross No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
rachel Oh... That's true.
ross Thank you!
rachel Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
sandy So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
joey I am learning so much from you.
chandler Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
monica Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
chandler Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
monica Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
chandler I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
joey Allright. See you later!
chandler See ya!
joey Did that guy really make that joke?
monica Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
ross Here goes...
rachel I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
ross Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
sandy Oh...
ross Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
rachel YOU! You feel!
ross I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
sandy Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
rachel Oh, damn you Geller!
ross Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
sandy No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
ross No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
sandy What is it...? Please...?
ross You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
sandy That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
ross Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
sandy hmmm...
ross I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
rachel Huh ha ha!
ross I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
sandy That must have been hard.
ross It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
sandy But you are a real boy!
ross I know I am!.And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
sandy It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
ross Here come some more...
sandygrumpus And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?
joeywigglemunch What kind?
sandygrumpus A friend-ship...
joey Wow! You blow my mind...
sandy Oh, I gotta go.
joey Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
sandy Twenty bucks.
joey It's like the cheapest college ever.
