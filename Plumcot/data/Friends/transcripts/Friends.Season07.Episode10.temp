phoebe Hey!
chandler Hey!
rachel_and_monica Hi!
phoebe Haaaa.... ahhhh!
chandler Pheebs?
phoebe Huh?
chandler Skull?
phoebe Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
rachel Oh my god!!
phoebe No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
ross Hey!
all Hey!
monica Licorice?
ross Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
all Ohh! That's great!
monica Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
ross Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
phoebe And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
rachel You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
ross Hmm.
joey Hey.
rachel Did you know he was in there?
monica No.
chandler How long have we been home?
monica About a half an hour.
chandler Lovely!
chandler Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
monica No.
chandler Why not?
monica Bing's weird.
phoebe Oh, hey, you guys!
chandler Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
monica Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
phoebe Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
chandler Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
phoebe Yeah, why not?
chandler Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
phoebe Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
chandler No reason, except...she...told...me.
phoebe Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
chandler No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
monica Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
phoebe You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
monica Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
phoebe Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
chandler Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
rachel Hey!
joey Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
rachel Drums?
joey No! Drums!
chandler Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
monica I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
maitre_d Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
chandler Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
maitre_d I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
chandler Is this because of the burrito thing?
monica You need to give him money.
chandler Give him money? It was a joke!
monica No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
chandler Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
monica You've got to be smooth about it.
chandler Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
maitre_d Of course, sir.
chandler Okay.
monica How did it go?
chandler Had the money in the wrong hand.
ross Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
ben No.
ross Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
ben Christmas.
ross Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
ben Christmas eve.
ross Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
ben Santa has reindeers that can fly!
ross Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
ben Jingle bells, jingle bells...
ross Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
ben Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
ross Okay, it's not a contest.
ben When is Santa coming?
ross Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
ben No Santa? Was I bad?
ross No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
ben Santa's mad at me.
ross No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
ben So Santa's coming?
ross Yes! Santa's coming!
monica It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
chandler How do you know so much about this?
monica I don't know.
chandler Richard used to do it, didn't he?
monica We'd be eating our soup right now.
chandler Mustached bastard
monica Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
chandler Excuse me...
male_guest Good evening.
chandler Ahh-hahaha!
rachel Ha!
phoebe So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
joey Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
rachel_and_joey Tequila!!
phoebe That's fun.
gunther Here you go.
chandler Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
joey Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
phoebe Hey!
joey Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
chandler Hey Pheebs!
phoebe Hey!
chandler If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
monica It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
phoebe Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
monica Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
phoebe Maybe on some level.
rachel Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
joey What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
phoebe Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
joey Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
phoebe It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
rachel What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
joey Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
rachel Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
phoebe Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
rachel What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
phoebe Our apartment is ready.
rachel And that makes you angry because
phoebe Because you would rather live here with Joey.
rachel Where did you get that?
phoebe Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
rachel Phoebe?
phoebe Hm?
rachel Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
phoebe Fish!
rachel It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
phoebe Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
rachel Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
phoebe We did have fun, didn't we?
rachel We did!
phoebe Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
rachel Oh, I would love to!
phoebe Yay, okay!
rachel Good, good, good, good, good.
phoebe Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
rachel Um... Done!
ross Hey!
salesman Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
ross No, these are my pants.
salesman Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
ross Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
salesman Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
ross Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
ross I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
monica What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
ross Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
monica Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
ben Texas?
ross That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
ben Wow! Thanks!
ross You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
ben Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
ross You are? Me, too!
monica Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
ross You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
ben Cool!
ross Yeah!
monica Come on Ben.
ross Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
chandler Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
ben Santa!
chandler Hey!
ross What are you doing here, Santa?
chandler Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
ross I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
chandler What?
ben Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
chandler You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
monica Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
ross What are you doing?
chandler You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
ross Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
chandler Why?
ross Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
chandler But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
ross I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
chandler Fine, I'll give the suit back.
monica Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
chandler Santa? Really?
monica Yes, is that okay?
chandler Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
monica No.
chandler Then it's okay!
ross Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
ben No! Why does he have to go?
chandler Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo?.are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
ben No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
ross Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
chandler Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
ben Okay, Santa!
ross All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
joey Merry Christmas!
rachel Oh wow! Look at this place!
phoebe Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
rachel Oh my God!
phoebe What?
rachel Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
phoebe Yeah?
rachel And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
phoebe Yeah?
rachel Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
phoebe Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
rachel See?
phoebe Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
rachel You can't, because of the new skylight!
phoebe There's a skylight?! Wow!!
rachel So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
phoebe Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
rachel Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
phoebe A little bit, yeah.
rachel Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
phoebe You heard her too?! You have the gift!
rachel Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
phoebe Are you sure?
rachel Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
phoebe Oh me too.
rachel I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
phoebe No, I do not hear that.
ross ...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for
ben Eight whole days.
ross That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
ben Awesome!
ross Yeah?
chandler My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
ross The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
rachel Hey!
phoebe Oh.
rachel Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
ross Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
rachel Oh.
phoebe Oh.
phoebe Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
rachel I got it!
joey Is it back in the cage?
rachel Its back in cage!
joey Cage closed?
rachel Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
