phoebe Hey!
ross Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
rachel Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
phoebe You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
rachel Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
phoebe All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.

joey Serious?
monica Are you scared?
joey No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
monica Ross will do it.

rachel Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
ross No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
dr_zane It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.

frank Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
dr_zane Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
phoebe Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
dr_zane Um-hmm, five actually.
phoebe Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
dr_zane We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
phoebe That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
frank Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
alice Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
phoebe Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
frank Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
alice Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
phoebe Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
dr_zane No, I'm sorry.
phoebe Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
frank I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
monica You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
