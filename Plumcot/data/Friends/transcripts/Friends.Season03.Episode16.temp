joey Previously on Friends.
ross I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
rachel You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
ross Is this about Mark?
rachel Oh my God.
ross Okay, it's not, it's not.
rachel Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
ross Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
rachel No. A break from us.
rachel Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
ross I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
mark Hey, what do you want to drink?
ross Who's that?
rachel Nobody.
ross Is that Mark?
rachel Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
ross Yeah! Got it!
chloe Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
monica Hey.
rachel Hey.
monica How's the big anniversary dinner?
rachel Well, we never actually got to dinner.
monica Ohhh, nice.
rachel No, we kinda broke up instead.
monica What?!
rachel God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
monica That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
rachel Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
monica Oh no!!
rachel No.
monica Rachel, you and Mark?!
rachel No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
chloe Morning!
rachel Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
ross Yeah!!
rachel Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
ross Na-huh.
rachel So, I love you.
ross I love you.
rachel And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
ross Okay.
rachel Bye.
ross Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
chloe Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
ross Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
chloe But my apartment is so...
ross Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
chloe Wait! Where's my shoes?
ross You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
chloe Do I know why we're rushing?
ross Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
chloe That's so great for you guys!
ross Yeah!
chloe You must be so happy!
ross Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
chloe Good luck, with your girlfriend.
ross Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
rachel Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
ross Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
rachel So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
ross Yes, you can, very much.
ross Ahhhh!!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey.
phoebe Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
monica Oh, there's banana on it.
phoebe Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
monica So then you know?
phoebe The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
monica Oh, good. Thanks.
phoebe Now what is Fabutec?
monica Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
phoebe Waxine!!
monica Yes! Have you seen it?
phoebe Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
monica I know!!
phoebe God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
monica Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
phoebe They have the best stuff in there.
chandler Oh my God! Oh my God!
joey Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
ross You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
chandler Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
ross What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
joey Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
chandler He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
joey Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
ross Yeah, but don't you think....
chandler All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
ross Yeah, okay.
joey All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
ross What trail?
joey The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
ross Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
chandler Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
phoebe After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
monica Did that!
phoebe Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
monica Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
phoebe Was it not pain-free?
monica No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
phoebe Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
monica That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
phoebe Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
monica Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
ross Chloe? Hi..
chloe Is this about me taking your watch?
ross You took my watch?
chloe I'm sorry, I do that.
ross Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
chloe Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
ross Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
chloe Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
ross You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
issac You dog!
ross Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
issac Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
ross Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
issac Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
ross Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
issac Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
ross Actually, no, we're not.
issac Yeah, we are.
ross No, we're not.
issac Yeah, we are.
ross No, we're not!!
issac Okay, we're not.
ross Right.
issac But, we are.
ross Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
issac I can promise not to tell her again.
ross Jasmine?
jasmine Uh-huh.
ross We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
jasmine You did a bad thing!
ross Yes, I did.
jasmine Very bad!
ross Very bad.
jasmine Very, very bad.
ross I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
jasmine No.
ross Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
jasmine All right.
ross Thank you, thank you.
jasmine But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
ross Who's your roommate?
ross Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
gunther I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
monica Ow!
phoebe Oh!!
monica Ow!! Ow!!
phoebe Ow!!!
monica_and_phoebe Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
phoebe We're all right.
monica It's okay, it's okay.
phoebe We're all right.
monica We were just waxing our legs.
chandler Off?!!
phoebe For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
chandler Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
joey Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
phoebe Oh yeah, come here.
chandler Oh, that's mature.
joey Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
phoebe Uh-huh.
monica That's right.
ross Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
rachel I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
monica What?
chandler Nothing, nothing.
monica Rachel said everything was okay.
phoebe What, what are they talking about?
ross Rachel?
rachel Just get away from me!
ross No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
rachel A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
phoebe Whe-where did he put it?!
rachel Ross, you had sex with another woman!
monica Oh my God.
phoebe Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
chandler Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
monica Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
chandler He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
rachel Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
ross No!!
rachel Just get out! Now!!
ross No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
rachel Okay! All right! How was she?
chandler Uh-oh.
ross What?
rachel Was she good?
joey Don't answer that.
rachel Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
ross She was...
joey Awful! Horrible!
chandler She was not good. Not good.
joey She was nothing compared to you.
ross She, she was different.
joey Ewwwww!
chandler Uh-oh.
rachel Good different?
ross Nobody likes change.
ross What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
phoebe Should we do something?
chandler Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
ross I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
rachel Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
ross Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
rachel And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
ross Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
rachel We were on a break!
ross That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
rachel You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
ross Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
rachel Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
joey Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
monica What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
joey Why not?! I'm hungry.
monica Because they'll know we've been listening.
rachel God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
ross Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
rachel Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
chandler Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
joey Yeah, we'll be fine.
ross Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
chandler Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
phoebe Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
ross Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
rachel All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
ross Yes I would.
rachel You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
ross Yes.
rachel You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
ross La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
all Ohhhhh!
ross What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
rachel I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
ross Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
joey Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
phoebe We could eat the wax! It's organic.
chandler Oh great, food with hair on it.
phoebe No, not the used wax.
chandler Because that would be crazy?
ross Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
rachel Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
ross No anchovies.
rachel With ah, extra anchovies.
ross That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
rachel Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
ross You can have the last piece, if you want.
rachel Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
phoebe They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
chandler Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
monica What if they don't?
joey You think I need a new walk?
chandler What?
joey Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
chandler Are you actually saying these words?
ross What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
joey Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
monica Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
phoebe Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
ross Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
rachel That's....
ross That's what?!
rachel That is neither here nor there.
ross Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
rachel No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
ross Okay, okay, okay.
rachel I think you should go.
ross What?
rachel I really think you need to go now.
ross Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
rachel Yeah, what the hell did I know!
ross Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
rachel No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
ross Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
rachel Then how come it is?
phoebe They've been quiet for a long time.
joey Maybe she killed him?
chandler Let's go.
chandler Is that your new walk?
joey No, I really have to pee.
