ross So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find
carol Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
ross Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
carol Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
ross Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
carol Oh, me too.
ross Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
carol Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
ross Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
ross Hey, Pheebs!
phoebe Hey.
ross Hey, how's it going?
phoebe Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
monica Here you go sweetie.
phoebe What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
monica But, I put some honey in it.
ross She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
chandler No, the doctors say it may kill her.
phoebe What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
chandler But I think we should tell her.
ross Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
phoebe Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
chandler Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
phoebe I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
monica Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
phoebe Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
chandler Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
phoebe Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
rachel Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
joey I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
rachel Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
joey Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
rachel Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
joey Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
rachel Umm, can I use your bathroom?
joey It's uh, right through there.
rachel Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
joey Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
rachel Yeah, it sure is!
monica I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
dr_roger They have parasites?
monica No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
dr_roger What people?
monica People! People say it! Come here!
dr_roger So oysters, huh?
monica And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
dr_roger Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases
monica No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
dr_roger Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
monica Okay! Ohhh no!
dr_roger I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
monica I can't promise anything.
ross We're really gonna do this, huh?
carol Looks like it.
ross Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at
carol I got it!
ross Okay.
carol Susan! Hi!
susan Hey!
carol Thank you so much for coming.
susan Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
ross I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
susan Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
carol Thank you so much.
ross How hot is this?!
chandler I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
monica Yeah, me too.
chandler Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
monica Stop it!! That's not funny!!
chandler Okay.
monica I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
chandler What was tonight?
monica You don't want to know what tonight was.
chandler Okay. What was tonight?
monica Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
chandler With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
monica All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
chandler Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
monica How many?
chandler Nine.
monica I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
chandler Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
monica No. He's not a horrible guy.
chandler Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
monica Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
chandler No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
monica Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
chandler Okay.
monica I was kidding.
chandler So was I.
rachel Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
joey Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
rachel Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
joey Yeah you did.
rachel Okay.
joey Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
rachel Yeah?
joey When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
rachel Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
joey Come, come here.
chandler We can't do this.
monica No! Oyster?
chandler Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
monica Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
chandler I do like that.
monica It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
chandler Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
monica Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
chandler Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
monica Noo!! Okay!!
chandler Okay!
monica Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
chandler I have some moves.
monica I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
chandler Yeah, let's just forget it.
monica What if I turn out the lights?
chandler Okay!
chandler Oh yeah.
monica Chandler?
chandler Yeah?
monica That's the couch.
chandler Oh my God!
monica I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
chandler Oh, okay!
joey Morning!
rachel Oh right.
joey Yeah.
rachel Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
joey Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
rachel Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh
joey No! No! No, not after seeing that.
rachel God I'm just a horrible person.
joey Wh-why?
rachel Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
joey That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
rachel Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
joey Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me
rachel The ring from the cave, yeah.
joey Wow! Uh okay, well uh
rachel Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
joey Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
rachel No! No-no-no
joey Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
rachel But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
joey Look, do you want the ring or not?!
rachel Yeah!
ross Hey!
joey Hey!
ross Look at you! You're up!
joey All right!
phoebe I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
joey Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
phoebe No. I've learned my lesson.
phoebe Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
ross Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
joey Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
ross No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
joey You?
ross Yeah!
joey Wow!
ross Yeah!
joey All right! So, was it amazing?
ross It was, it was okay.
joey Just okay-Did you do it right?!
ross Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
joey Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
ross Oh-oh, absolutely!
ross It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
joey But you got to be with both of them, right?
ross Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
joey Not the other one?
ross No, she kept kicking me away!
joey Yeah, you don't want that.
ross No!
joey Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
ross Oh I a lot of stuff!
joey You got a little bored?
ross A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
joey Yeah? What did ya have?
ross Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
joey Sounds good.
ross It really was!
chandler Hey!
monica Hey!
chandler Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
monica Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
chandler So you uh, want to do something tonight?
monica Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
chandler Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when
monica Are you okay?
chandler Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
monica Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
chandler I bet he can.
monica Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
chandler Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
rachel Ohh! My God! Barry!!
barry You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!

ross Hey Rachel.
rachel Is Joey Tribbiani here?
ross Umm, no.
rachel Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
ross That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
rachel Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
ross Yeah.
rachel Sit down!
ross Okay.
rachel Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
ross We're sorry.
rachel No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
ross Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
rachel Aw what are you?! A detective?
ross Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
rachel Oh.
ross Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
rachel Who are these men?
ross Men. I guy I know.
rachel Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
ross She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
rachel Good day for married people huh?
ross I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
rachel I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
ross Try telling my wife that.
chandler Okay to come in?
monica Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
chandler Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
monica What?!
chandler I'm the ruptured spleen.
monica Why would you do that?
chandler Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
monica Really?
chandler Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
monica Chandler!
chandler I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
monica There was just one woman, wasn't there?
chandler No, there were two.
monica Including me?
chandler Oh yeah.
