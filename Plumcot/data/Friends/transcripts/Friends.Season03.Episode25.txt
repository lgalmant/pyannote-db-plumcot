chandler_bing So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
bonnie All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
chandler_bing Tell it again. Seriously.
rachel_green I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
monica_geller Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
joey_tribbiani Well, I think we all learned something.
phoebe_buffay Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
chandler_bing Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
phoebe_buffay Y'know what that means?
joey_tribbiani That you're actually 50?
phoebe_buffay No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
all@ Oh!
rachel_green That is so cool.
phoebe_buffay I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
all@ Yeah! Yeah, we can!
bonnie Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
dr_ross_geller That's too bad.
rachel_green Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
phoebe_buffay So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
monica_geller Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
chandler_bing You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
monica_geller Thanks!
chandler_bing Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
monica_geller Yeah right.
chandler_bing Why is that so funny?
monica_geller You made a joke right? So I laughed.
chandler_bing Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
monica_geller Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
chandler_bing Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
monica_geller Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
joey_tribbiani No, it's just my luggage.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@monica_geller Hey!!
joey_tribbiani Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!

rachel_green I don't know.
dr_ross_geller You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
rachel_green All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
dr_ross_geller Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
rachel_green Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
dr_ross_geller You still love me?
rachel_green Noo.
dr_ross_geller You still love me.
rachel_green Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
dr_ross_geller Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
rachel_green Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...

phoebe_buffay I'm sorry.
phoebe_abbott_sr What are you doing here?!
phoebe_buffay I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
phoebe_abbott_sr What?!
phoebe_buffay Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
phoebe_abbott_sr All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
phoebe_buffay My Father is Chuck Magioni?
phoebe_abbott_sr No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
phoebe_abbott_sr But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
phoebe_buffay Heh?
phoebe_abbott_sr Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
joey_tribbiani I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
dr_ross_geller That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
chandler_bing Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......

bonnie You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
chandler_bing Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
bonnie Okay, well g'night.

bonnie Don't be too long.
dr_ross_geller Okey-dokey!
chandler_bing There is not one hair on that head.
dr_ross_geller Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
joey_tribbiani So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
