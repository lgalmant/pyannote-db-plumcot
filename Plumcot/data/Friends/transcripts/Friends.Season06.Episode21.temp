rachel Okay, Chandler!
chandler Okay.
rachel And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
chandler Oh, well thank you in advance.
rachel Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
monica You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
rachel Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
joey Hey guys!
chandler Hey!!
rachel Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
chandler Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
joey Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
phoebe No! Joey, you're going to be great!
joey But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
monica I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
phoebe I'll be waiting.
chandler Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
phoebe No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
rachel Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
phoebe Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
ross Hey!

wayne It can do this.
elizabeth This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.

paul I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
ross Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
paul So Ross, what your problem?
ross Eh-wh-Excuse me?
paul Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
ross That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.

ross Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
paul Okay.
ross What?
paul Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
elizabeth Daddy!
paul Fine! Two minutes. Go.
ross This is-you-
paul 1 minute 50 seconds.

I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.

phoebe Yeah. Not looking for dates.
elizabeth So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
monica And he's a great brother!
paul I had a sister.
monica Ohh!
paul She passed away.
monica_and_phoebe Ohh!
paul Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
chandler But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
paul A part of him did yes.
ross Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
chandler Yes, we were just
rachel Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
paul I'm already here.
rachel Oh! Ross is sooo great!
chandler Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
monica No, you said the baby creeps you out.
chandler No, the little girl creeps me out.
monica You said the baby.
chandler Why would the baby creep me out?
monica Why would the little girl creep you out?
phoebe You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
chandler This is going in your book?
phoebe Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
monica What?! Excuse me!
phoebe And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
rachel Oh hi!
paul Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
rachel Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
paul No.

paul Oh, here they are right here.
rachel Oh good.
paul Thanks for your help.
rachel Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
paul Just call me Paul.
rachel Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
paul Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
rachel You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
paul Well, we were very young when we had her.
rachel Oh. We?
paul Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to
rachel Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
paul I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
rachel Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
paul Yes I did.
rachel Ohh. Ooh!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hey!
monica How was your first day?
joey Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
chandler Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
joey Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
phoebe Well, why don't you just get him fired?
joey I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
estelle Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
joey Wow!
estelle The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
joey I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
estelle Uh-oh!
ross Joey?!
paul Hi Ross.
rachel I was just getting him to like you.
ross Joey?! Joey!!
rachel Ross, Joey is not here.
ross Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
rachel Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
paul Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
ross Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
paul Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
rachel Bye!
paul I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
ross What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
rachel Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them
ross In your mouth?!
rachel No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
ross You were at the coffeehouse!
rachel Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
ross He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
rachel Wh-You dated my sister!
ross That was different!
rachel What? Why?!
ross This is weird for me!
rachel Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
ross How is that important?
rachel Oh it's important!
joey Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
monica Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
joey Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
monica No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
joey That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
chandler So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
monica Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
chandler Yeah, you wish.
phoebe "You wish."
monica Phoebe, stop writing about us!
phoebe I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
chandler Who?
phoebe Marcia and Chester.
monica Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
chandler Hmm.
monica Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
chandler Oh.
phoebe I see what you're doing!
monica Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
chandler Oh-oh.
phoebe Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
joey Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
wayne Don't touch him!
joey Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
rachel So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
elizabeth What a nice story!
paul So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
rachel Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
ross Yeah, take your time.
ross Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as
paul Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
ross Not all bad.
paul And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
ross Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
paul I beg your pardon?
ross No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
paul You have a son?
ross Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
paul Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
rachel Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
ross You're back.
paul You two were married?!
rachel Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
monica Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
chandler We said seven!
monica We said six!
chandler The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
monica Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
phoebe Hi!
chandler Oh my good God.
monica Ugh!
phoebe I know what time you said.
chandler What?!
phoebe Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
monica What time?
phoebe Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
chandler What does it say?!
phoebe I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
chandler Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
phoebe Thanks! So are you.
chandler I told you I should not wear this color.
phoebe Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
chandler So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
phoebe That's right.
monica Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
phoebe Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
joey I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
chandler Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
joey Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
wayne Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
joey Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
chandler Hi, how are ya?
wayne Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
joey Why should I help you?!
chandler The reason he just said.
joey What do you need?
wayne I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
joey Yeah?
wayne I wish I could talk to her.
joey What are you in love with her or something?
wayne Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
chandler Yeah, I've been there my friend.
wayne Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
joey Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
rachel I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
paul How to make the next one even shorter?
rachel Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
paul Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
ross Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
paul Are you yelling at me?!
ross God no!
elizabeth Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
paul Really?!
ross Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
paul Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
ross That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
paul Then we agree?
ross Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
paul Neither of us like Ross!
elizabeth I like Ross.
ross Ohhh! Kids!
rachel Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
ross That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
rachel Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
joey Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
cheese The shipment never made it through Omaha?
joey You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
