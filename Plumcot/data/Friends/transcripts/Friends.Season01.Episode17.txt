monica_geller Okay, okay. I hate this.
rachel_green Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
monica_geller Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode17 Why?
monica_geller I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode17 You are an idiot. .
monica_geller yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
dr_ross_geller I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani That's nice.
dr_ross_geller No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
joey_tribbiani Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
dr_ross_geller Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
chandler_bing What are you crazy? That's a baby!
joey_tribbiani He should take the sack?
dr_ross_geller Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
chandler_bing Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
joey_tribbiani Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
chandler_bing Well, only if you order stuff.
joey_tribbiani I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
dr_ross_geller Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
joey_tribbiani When's that?
dr_ross_geller Tonight.
joey_tribbiani Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
dr_ross_geller You take your time.
chandler_bing There it is! So what're you gonna do?
joey_tribbiani What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
chandler_bing And your friend Phoebe?
joey_tribbiani Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
chandler_bing Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
dr_michael_mitchell ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
dr_michael_mitchell Okay, errrr, Monica?
monica_geller Yes? ..yes, she is.
rachel_green Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
monica_geller Hi.
dr_michael_mitchell Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.

monica_geller Thank you.
rachel_green Right.
rachel_green ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
monica_geller Uh, you left out the stupid part.
rachel_green Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
monica_geller I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
rachel_green What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
chandler_bing Alright, what have we learned so far?
the_whole_party#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode17 SURPRISE!!!

rachel_green I hope it's okay.
monica_geller Oh...

chandler_bing Did you see Betty?
jack_geller I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
dr_ross_geller Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
jack_geller I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
dr_ross_geller Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
jack_geller No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
dr_ross_geller No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
jack_geller 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
dr_ross_geller Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
jack_geller Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
jack_geller So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
dr_ross_geller No, we can go to Williamsburg.
jack_geller Eat your fish.
monica_geller Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
rachel_green Okay, coming!
monica_geller Hi, come on in.
dr_michael_mitchell Hey.
monica_geller Hi, Geoffrey.
rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller Ah here, we brought wine.
dr_michael_mitchell Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
rachel_green Oh, that's great. Look at that.
dr_ross_geller So, Monica, how's the ankle?
monica_geller It's uh...
monica_geller ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
rachel_green You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
rachel_green Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
monica_geller It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
rachel_green Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
monica_geller A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
dr_michael_mitchell So?
dr_ross_geller So... they sss-still seem normal.
dr_michael_mitchell That's because they are.
dr_ross_geller okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
dr_michael_mitchell Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
monica_geller I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
rachel_green I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
monica_geller Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
rachel_green You know what?
monica_geller What?
rachel_green You know what?
monica_geller What!?
rachel_green You know what?
monica_geller What!!?
rachel_green Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
rachel_green Hello! Here we go!
dr_ross_geller This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
rachel_green Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
monica_geller Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
dr_michael_mitchell Really?
monica_geller Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
dr_ross_geller So, Monica, what do you do?
rachel_green Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
dr_ross_geller Good for you.
rachel_green Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
dr_ross_geller This hummus is great.
dr_michael_mitchell God bless the chickpea.
monica_geller Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
rachel_green And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
monica_geller I used to wet my bed.
rachel_green I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
monica_geller We both do that!

rachel_green Would you excuse me for a second?
monica_geller Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
rachel_green Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
monica_geller Ross, he's got the remote again.
dr_ross_geller Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
dr_ross_geller Maybe not.
rachel_green Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
