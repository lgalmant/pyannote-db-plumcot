monica_geller I've been great, just great. How have you been?
dr_richard_burke Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
monica_geller The head tilt?
dr_richard_burke Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
monica_geller I'm sorry.
dr_richard_burke No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
monica_geller Oh, that's too bad.
dr_richard_burke I'll survive.
chandler_bing Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

phoebe_buffay You are so smitten.
monica_geller I am not.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
monica_geller Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
phoebe_buffay So. You two are totally into each other.
monica_geller Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
phoebe_buffay OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
monica_geller Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.

rachel_green Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
dr_ross_geller I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
rachel_green OK.
dr_ross_geller OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
