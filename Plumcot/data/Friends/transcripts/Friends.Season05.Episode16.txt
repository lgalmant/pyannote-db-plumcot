joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani What are you guys doing up?
chandler_bing Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
joey_tribbiani Dark red.
chandler_bing Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
monica_geller Yes, you are so smart!
joey_tribbiani Aww, you guys are so cute!
monica_geller I know.
joey_tribbiani All right, I'll see you in the morning.
chandler_bing@monica_geller Okay.
monica_geller Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
joey_tribbiani Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
monica_geller Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but
joey_tribbiani Cat.
monica_geller Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
joey_tribbiani I love you too.
rachel_green Uhh, we still need a tip.
phoebe_buffay All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
rachel_green A couple of bucks.
phoebe_buffay Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
monica_geller Wow!
chandler_bing Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
rachel_green Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you guys!
chandler_bing Hey!
rachel_green Hey Joey!
monica_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
monica_geller Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
joey_tribbiani Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
monica_geller I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
joey_tribbiani No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
monica_geller Are you saying I smell bad?
joey_tribbiani No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
monica_geller What's with him?
chandler_bing Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
rachel_green Ugh!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
rachel_green What?! You say that to kids?!!
dr_ross_geller No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
rachel_green Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
the_salesman You picked a great couch.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
the_salesman Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
dr_ross_geller Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
rachel_green Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
rachel_green Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
rachel_green Oh. Oh! I can do it!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
the_salesman You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
the_salesman Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
rachel_green Ross!
dr_ross_geller What's that supposed to mean?
rachel_green Ross!
the_salesman Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
dr_ross_geller Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
the_salesman Really? You two?
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Rach?
rachel_green Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
dr_ross_geller Then tell him quickly.
rachel_green Fine! We went out.
dr_ross_geller Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
rachel_green Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
dr_ross_geller A loser you did it with 298 times!
phoebe_buffay Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
the_smoking_woman Yes?
phoebe_buffay You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
the_smoking_woman Yeah I can, it worked real well.
phoebe_buffay No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
the_smoking_woman I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
phoebe_buffay Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
the_smoking_woman What?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
the_smoking_woman Who are you talking too?
phoebe_buffay Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
the_smoking_woman I am not going to apologize to a tree!
phoebe_buffay You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
the_smoking_woman I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
phoebe_buffay Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
dr_ross_geller Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
dr_ross_geller Okay, go left. Left! Left!
rachel_green Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
dr_ross_geller Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Good-good-good.
rachel_green Oh-oh!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
rachel_green Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
phoebe_buffay ...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
monica_geller Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
phoebe_buffay I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
chandler_bing Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
phoebe_buffay You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Oh.
chandler_bing Hi, Joe.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
monica_geller Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
joey_tribbiani What?! Why?!
monica_geller What is going on with you?
joey_tribbiani Nothing!
chandler_bing Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
joey_tribbiani All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
chandler_bing Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
joey_tribbiani Well, it involved Monica.
chandler_bing You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
joey_tribbiani Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
monica_geller What was the dream about?
joey_tribbiani Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
monica_geller Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
joey_tribbiani It-it doesn't?
monica_geller No!
chandler_bing No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
joey_tribbiani That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
monica_geller Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
joey_tribbiani In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
monica_geller Um-hmm.
chandler_bing Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
joey_tribbiani Not really.
chandler_bing Well there you have it!
monica_geller Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
joey_tribbiani No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
chandler_bing Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
joey_tribbiani Friends first? That's interesting.
monica_geller You become friends after?
joey_tribbiani No, never done that either.
rachel_green Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
monica_geller That's right.
rachel_green What's up Joey?
joey_tribbiani How you doin'?
phoebe_buffay Excuse me, is this your car?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
phoebe_buffay Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 So am I!
phoebe_buffay Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
phoebe_buffay I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
phoebe_buffay I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Who-who else is in vice up there?
phoebe_buffay Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 No, I don't know him.
phoebe_buffay Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
phoebe_buffay I-I sure will, take care.
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
phoebe_buffay Oh.
rachel_green Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
rachel_green Thanks!
joey_tribbiani Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
rachel_green I know.
joey_tribbiani Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
rachel_green What's up Joe?
joey_tribbiani Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
rachel_green Yeah?
joey_tribbiani ...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So
rachel_green What are you saying?
joey_tribbiani I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
rachel_green Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
joey_tribbiani I'll treat you real nice.
rachel_green Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
joey_tribbiani Won't-won't that take longer?
rachel_green Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
dr_ross_geller Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
rachel_green Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
dr_ross_geller Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
rachel_green Well, I brought the next best thing.
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
chandler_bing Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
dr_ross_geller Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
rachel_green Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's me.
rachel_green Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
dr_ross_geller No! That's-that's my arm!
chandler_bing Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
rachel_green Okay!
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller Come on, Chandler.
dr_ross_geller All right. Okay, here we go!
dr_ross_geller All right, ready?
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Turn.
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller Turn! Turn!
chandler_bing Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
rachel_green Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
chandler_bing Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
dr_ross_geller Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
chandler_bing@rachel_green You think?!
dr_ross_geller All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
chandler_bing Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe that didn't work!
rachel_green I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
chandler_bing Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
chandler_bing Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
monica_geller Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
joey_tribbiani Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
rachel_green What?! Why?!
joey_tribbiani Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
monica_geller What about the closeness?
joey_tribbiani Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
joey_tribbiani All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
chandler_bing Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
joey_tribbiani Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
monica_geller Who is it?
voice#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 N.Y.P.D!!
joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Uhh, just a minute officer!!
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
rachel_green Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
phoebe_buffay Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
phoebe_buffay Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
phoebe_buffay I would love it if I weren't here!
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
phoebe_buffay Me?!
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Nice!
phoebe_buffay Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
phoebe_buffay Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer
cop#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode16 Gary.
phoebe_buffay Gary.
gary Okay, so it's a date.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
gary Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, impressive.
gary Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
gary Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
phoebe_buffay All right, I can't wait!
gary Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
chandler_bing He has a gun!
dr_ross_geller I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
the_saleswoman You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
dr_ross_geller That's what I'm telling you.
the_saleswoman Did you cut this couch in half?
dr_ross_geller This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
the_saleswoman You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
dr_ross_geller Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
the_saleswoman I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
dr_ross_geller I take it.
