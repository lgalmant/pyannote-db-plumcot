rachel So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
monica This bottle opener.
rachel And?
monica And it's a magnet!
rachel Look at that!
ross How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
rachel What?!
ross You complete me kitchen, matey!
phoebe Ross, I know what you're thinking.
ross What?
phoebe That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
ross Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
phoebe What?!!
ross Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
phoebe No!
ross Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
monica Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
rachel No-no, I bought those.
monica Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
rachel Yeah.
monica That you're a liar.
ross No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
monica Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
ross Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
rachel Well, who wouldn't?!
ross I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
phoebe Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
rachel And Mrs.?!
phoebe Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
rachel What?!!
phoebe Just kidding!
rachel Ohh! Oh God!
phoebe Saved your ass.
chandler Hey!
phoebe Hi.
monica Hey!
chandler Oh, what's the matter?
phoebe Well, you know that psychic I see?
chandler Yeah?
phoebe Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
chandler What?!
phoebe Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
monica Phoebe that's crazy!
joey I can't believe she would say that too you.
rachel Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
phoebe I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
chandler Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
phoebe No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now!
ross Hey everyone!
chandler Oh hi!
ross Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
all Oh that'd be great. Sure!
ross "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
phoebe Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
ross "...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
joey Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
ross No! Why?
joey Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
ross Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
chandler Why don't you open with a joke?
ross Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
chandler Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
ross Okay!
all Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
rachel Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
ross Thank you!
rachel Some uh, some visual aides.
joey Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
ross Please don't say naked chicks.
joey Why not?!
ross I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
chandler That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
chandler Hey.
joey Hey! Any good mail?
chandler Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
joey Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
chandler "Benefits lapsed."
joey Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
chandler Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
joey Let me see that!
chandler All right.
joey Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
chandler I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
joey All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
chandler Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
joey ...look both ways before you cross the street.
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
phoebe Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
rachel Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
phoebe I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
rachel Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
phoebe Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
rachel Monica!
monica Hmm?
rachel Did-did you take these back?
monica No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
rachel Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
monica I loved them!
rachel Yeah. Nice try!
ross Hello!
monica Hey!
rachel Hey!
monica How'd the lecture go?
ross It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
rachel Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
ross I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
monica That you're not funny or sexy?
ross That's right!
joey Hey Estelle, listen
estelle Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
joey What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
estelle Really?!
joey Yeah!
estelle Oh well, no harm, no foul.
joey Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
estelle All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
joey Why?
estelle Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
joey Bastard!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
chandler That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
joey What?!
chandler What's wrong with you?
joey Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
chandler This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
joey No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
chandler That's a hernia.
joey Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
rachel Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
monica Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
rachel Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
ross Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
monica What the hell are you doing?!
ross Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
rachel Yeah, and not a very good one.
ross Will you-will you please?
the_professor Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
ross Oh.
the_professor Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
ross I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
monica Monica Gellerrr.
ross Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
monica Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
ross Just please stop!
rachel Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
chandler Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
joey Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
chandler I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
joey Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
phoebe Hey!
chandler Hey.
joey Hey!
phoebe What's going on?
chandler Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
joey Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
phoebe Hey! Maybe you'll die!
joey Sure, now I'm scared.
phoebe No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
joey Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
phoebe No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
monica Gimme 'em!
rachel No! They are mine!
monica You stole them from me!
rachel You stole them from me!!
monica Gimme them!
monica You just wanna each take one?
rachel Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
ross Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
rachel Well
monica Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
rachel Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
ross They're not listening too me?
rachel Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
ross Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
monica I think you look fine.
casting_director_1 Whenever you're ready.
joey Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
casting_director_1 Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?

rachel Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
russell Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
rachel Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
ross All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
a_student What's happening to your accent?
ross Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
rachel Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
ross Well, hello Rachel!
phoebe Have you really done this before?
