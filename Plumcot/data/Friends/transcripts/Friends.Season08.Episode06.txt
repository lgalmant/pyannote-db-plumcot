phoebe_buffay Yeah.
eric Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
eric I'm an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.
phoebe_buffay My mother killed herself.
eric She, now I knew that and...now I'm sweating. Look at me, I'm really sweating-Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
phoebe_buffay No-no! That's okay, we'll just start over. Okay? Hi! I'm Phoebe.
eric Eric.
phoebe_buffay Why are you looking at me like that?
eric 'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
phoebe_buffay Okay. So, what are you?
eric I don't think they have a name for it. It's just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.
phoebe_buffay No I-I meant your costume.
eric Oh umm, I'm the solar system. Yeah, my students helped me make it-I teach the second grade.
phoebe_buffay I love the second grade!
eric Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
eric So what do you do?
phoebe_buffay Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day.
eric Y'know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me
phoebe_buffay No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
eric Oh I feel very lucky, she's great. I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
monica_geller Hey Joey?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
monica_geller You read comic books right?
joey_tribbiani Exclusively.
monica_geller Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
joey_tribbiani Catwoman, hands down.
monica_geller Yeah
joey_tribbiani But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
monica_geller What?! Really?!
joey_tribbiani Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?
monica_geller No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?

joey_tribbiani Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
monica_geller Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
joey_tribbiani I would say, "Woman, please!"
phoebe_buffay Hey. Ursula's fiancáe is really sweet! He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!

phoebe_buffay Oh really?
eric We're both teachers.
phoebe_buffay Huh?
eric And we were both in the Peace Corps.
phoebe_buffay Peace Corps, really?
eric In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. Shall we get me really drunk?
eric Sure.
chandler_bing Howdy doody.
dr_ross_geller That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
chandler_bing Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
chandler_bing What question?
joey_tribbiani Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
chandler_bing There's no question.
joey_tribbiani So you think Ross too?
chandler_bing You picked Ross?!
monica_geller Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.
chandler_bing I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
dr_ross_geller Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
chandler_bing Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
dr_ross_geller Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
monica_geller Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
joey_tribbiani Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
mona Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.

rachel_green Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
the_boy_in_the_cape This isn't fair.

rachel_green No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook!
monica_geller Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
chandler_bing That means nothing to me. Come on!
phoebe_buffay Hi liar!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Hey!
phoebe_buffay Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Well they could be true.
phoebe_buffay But they're not!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Yeah, it's a fine line huh?
phoebe_buffay Why are you lying to him?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 I don't know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
eric Honey?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
eric She's helped so many people to quit smoking.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Y'know, we'd really better get going.

dr_ross_geller Pride.
chandler_bing And dignity.
joey_tribbiani Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
mona Wow! They're both really strong.
joey_tribbiani Or equally weak.
monica_geller Oh God!
phoebe_buffay Hmm?
monica_geller Chandler's making his sex face.
dr_ross_geller So, you gettin' tired?
chandler_bing Nope! I can do this all day.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
chandler_bing God, I'm exhausted.
dr_ross_geller Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
chandler_bing No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
dr_ross_geller Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
chandler_bing You're Spudnik.
dr_ross_geller Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
chandler_bing Fine. Oh no!
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah!
mona Yay! My hero!
joey_tribbiani You're a weird lady.
eric Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
eric What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
phoebe_buffay Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
eric Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding.
phoebe_buffay Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
eric I think we'll be okay. Besides it's so perfect and she's been saving herself for me.
phoebe_buffay Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
eric What?
phoebe_buffay She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
eric She told me she was 25.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger.
eric I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
phoebe_buffay No. You're not, you're not stupid.
eric I'm not smart. I just wanted so much to...be impulsive once. To be romantic.
phoebe_buffay That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
eric It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Eric!! Let's go!!
eric I'd better go, deal
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you should.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode06 Hurry up I gotta pray!!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
joey_tribbiani That's not so bad.
rachel_green No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
joey_tribbiani Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
rachel_green Really? You think that's all it is?
joey_tribbiani Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
monica_geller Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
chandler_bing Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
monica_geller Is that a secret or a lie.
chandler_bing No, I let him win-Ross!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
chandler_bing Would you tell her I let you win please?
dr_ross_geller Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!
chandler_bing I am strong! I'll show you!
monica_geller Chandler please!
chandler_bing Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
monica_geller Let's go big bunny!
chandler_bing Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
