rach Ross kissed me.
mnca Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
rach It was unbelievable!
mnca Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
phoe Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
rach Oh, it ended very well.
phoe Oh.
mnca Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
phoe Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
rach Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
phoe Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
rach No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
phoemnca Ohhhh.
ross And, uh, and then I kissed her.
joey Tongue?
ross Yeah.
joey Cool.
chan All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
phoe Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
chan Games and stuff.
mnca There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
joey Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
mnca There's an ad for a naked chef?
joey No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
ross Hi.
phoe Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
ross That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
mnca Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
ross Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
joey You got all that from saline solution?
mnca We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
ross Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and..... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
rach Hey, you.
ross How are you?
rach Good. How are you?
ross Good.
julie Hi, honey.
ross Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
julie Good.
ross Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
phoe Oh, well, actually.
ross Play it.
phoe Ok, all right.
joey Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
julie What?
ross Ssshh.
phoe Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
phoe There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
rtst This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
mnca So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
rtst Mockolate.
mnca I'm sorry?
rtst Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
mnca Ohh.
rtst Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
mnca All right. Mmm-mmm.
rtst Yeah?
mnca I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
rtst No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
mnca Mmm-mmm.
rtst But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
mnca Wow.
rtst Aren't you going to swallow that?
mnca Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
rtst Yeah, isn't that great?
mnca Mmm.
rtst Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
mnca Abso......lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
rtst Really?
mnca Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
mnca How about Mockolate mousse?
phoe It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
mnca Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
phoe What makes it pilgrim?
mnca We'll put buckles on it.
rach Hey.
phoe Hey.
mnca Hey.
rach Did uh, Ross call?
mnca No, I'm sorry.
rach Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
phoe No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
ross I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
chan Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
joey Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
chan Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
joey Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
chan Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
ross Can't we just use a pen?
chan No, Amish boy.
joey Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
ross I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
joey You could say that.
ross And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
chan Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
ross I don't know.
joey Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
chan Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
ross She's not Rachel.
mnca Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
rach Oh my god.
mnca Oh my god good?
rach Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
phoe Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
chan I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
joey Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
ross Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
chan So, Spock actually hugs his father?
rach Hey, do you guys have......hi.
ross Hi.
rach Where you goin'?
ross I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
rach Oh.
ross No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
rach Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
ross Well, uh.
joey He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
rach Really?
ross Really. It's always been you, Rach.
rach Oh, god.
joeychan Ohhh.
rach Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
ross I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
rach Let me get my coat.
ross Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
rach Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
chan What? Nothing.
rach What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
chan No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
rach Well what is it? Let me see.
ross Hey, someone order a coat?
rach Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
ross He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
chan Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
rach And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
chan_joey_ross No!
rach Come on.
joey Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
chan Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
ross That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
rach All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
ross No, you don't.
rach All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
rach What is this? Ross, what is this?
chan Good luck.
ross Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
rach Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
ross Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
rach Just a waitress?
ross No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
rach Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
ross No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
rach She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
ross No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
chan My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
mnca You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
phoe I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
joey Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
phoe What?
mnca What?
chan Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
mnca This was your idea?
phoe What were you thinking?
chan All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
mnca Yeah. You!
chan All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
phoe Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
ross Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
rach When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
ross I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
rach Not interested.
ross Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
ross Number six: the way you smell.
joey Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
ross Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
joey Oh, yeah, I do.
chan What are you doing out there?
ross I am, uh, I am...
mnca Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
ross Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
rach No.
ross No?
rach That's what I said.
chan Look, maybe we should go?
rach No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
ross Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
rach No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
ross No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
rach Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
ross You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
rach Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
joey I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
mnca Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
rtst Doesn't matter.
mnca What?
rtst Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
mnca Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
rtst Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
mnca Well, uh, I ate some.
rtst Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
mnca Hello?
ross Hi.
rach Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
mnca Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
ross Look, can, can you do something for me?
mnca Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
radio The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
radio Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
rtst Hi, thanks for coming in again.
mnca Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
rtst It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
mnca Cat hair.
rtst Oh, sorry.
