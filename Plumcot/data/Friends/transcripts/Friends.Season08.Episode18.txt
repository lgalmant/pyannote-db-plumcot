phoebe_buffay Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
monica_geller Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Sure. Yeah.
joey_tribbiani So, who's the guy?
phoebe_buffay Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
chandler_bing Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
monica_geller Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
dr_ross_geller Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
monica_geller Yeah, I'd really like to.
dr_ross_geller Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
monica_geller Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
chandler_bing And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
monica_geller No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
joey_tribbiani Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
monica_geller Really you can do that?
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
chandler_bing What are you doing?
monica_geller Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
chandler_bing It's a dog.
monica_geller It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
chandler_bing It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
monica_geller The good stuff, huh?
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
dr_ross_geller Aww that is so cool.
joey_tribbiani And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
rachel_green Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
chandler_bing Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
dr_ross_geller Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
monica_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
all@ Hi!
phoebe_buffay Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is
parker No, no, no wait! Don't tell me. Let me guess. Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I'm sorry Phoebe didn't mention you. Chandler, I'm kidding all ready you're my favorite!
chandler_bing Ha!
parker Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self?
dr_ross_geller Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
parker Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I?
rachel_green I, uh, think you already are.
parker Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than-Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
monica_geller That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
parker Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where's the party?
monica_geller It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
parker Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber's Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.}
dr_ross_geller Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.
monica_geller Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
chandler_bing Yeah.
monica_geller And I've got the car keys.
parker We're driving!?
monica_geller Yeah.
parker Aces!
dr_ross_geller So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
rachel_green Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
dr_ross_geller Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
rachel_green Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.
jack_geller@judy_geller Hi
dr_ross_geller Hi! Hey mom.
rachel_green This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
judy_geller Jack?
jack_geller Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
dr_ross_geller That's a good question, dad. That's a good question
rachel_green Hmmm....
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Congratulations you two!
rachel_green Thank you...we're so excited
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 And also, congratulations on your wedding.
dr_ross_geller Wha-What?
judy_geller Can we talk to you for just a y'know... It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green What?!
judy_geller Thanks for going along with this.
dr_ross_geller Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
jack_geller Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
dr_ross_geller Can you believe that?
rachel_green Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
dr_ross_geller No, us having to lie about being married.
rachel_green No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just...smile. We'll nod along.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Ross!
man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Rachel!
dr_ross_geller Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
aunt_lisa Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Hmmmm....
uncle_dan Here's a little something to get you started.
rachel_green Oh
aunt_lisa So, how's married life treating you?
rachel_green Unbelievable!
dr_ross_geller We love marriage!
aunt_lisa Great!
dr_ross_geller Hey
phoebe_buffay Hey!
parker What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C...I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don't want to forget this moment! It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!
chandler_bing I don't think the flash went off.
parker Dahaaa! I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
phoebe_buffay I'll go with you
parker Come on!
chandler_bing Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
joey_tribbiani I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
dr_ross_geller I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
monica_geller He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
dr_ross_geller This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry
phoebe_buffay Were you guys making fun of Parker?
dr_ross_geller That depends, how much did you hear?
phoebe_buffay So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?
monica_geller It's just that, it's so much.
phoebe_buffay Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.
monica_geller I feel terrible.
joey_tribbiani I know
dr_ross_geller What was wrong with Mona?
rachel_green Open it! Open it! Open it!
dr_ross_geller Yeah baby!
man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 So we never got to hear about your wedding!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 We were surprise that we weren't invited.
dr_ross_geller No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
rachel_green But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Where did you have it?
rachel_green On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Really?
rachel_green Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
rachel_green So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
dr_ross_geller Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?
rachel_green What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
rachel_green Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
parker Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
phoebe_buffay No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
parker And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.
phoebe_buffay Hm huh, yeah.
parker Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
phoebe_buffay No, that's not necessary.
parker Please.
phoebe_buffay No, actually I don't eat
parker I won't quit until you try.
phoebe_buffay Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....
parker What are they like? I've never had one.
phoebe_buffay Why don't you just try one?
parker No, they look too weird.
chandler_bing What are you doin'?
monica_geller Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
chandler_bing Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could
rachel_green And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 Blind?
rachel_green Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
aunt_lisa I'll bet you looked beautiful
rachel_green Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode18 So, how did you propose?
rachel_green Oh yeah. That's a great story.
dr_ross_geller Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower
aunt_lisa Oh that is so sweet!
rachel_green Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
dr_ross_geller Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
rachel_green And the ring, was the size of my fist !
joey_tribbiani Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
phoebe_buffay Then you better do it now.
joey_tribbiani Why?
phoebe_buffay Because I'm going to kill him
joey_tribbiani What-what?
phoebe_buffay You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
joey_tribbiani I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
phoebe_buffay Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
joey_tribbiani I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
phoebe_buffay He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
phoebe_buffay You think?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
phoebe_buffay You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
joey_tribbiani Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
phoebe_buffay What's that now?
joey_tribbiani Nothing
phoebe_buffay Oh look it's Parker!
parker Look! It's the bunny hop!
phoebe_buffay Oooh I love it!
parker You do?!
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
monica_geller Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
monica_geller No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!
judy_geller Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
jack_geller Why don't I remember this dog?
judy_geller Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
dr_ross_geller Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.
judy_geller You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary
dr_ross_geller No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
judy_geller Oh Ross
jack_geller I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
parker My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
phoebe_buffay Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
parker I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
phoebe_buffay Oh thank God.
parker It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst
phoebe_buffay Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
parker That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.
phoebe_buffay Let's try something else, let's play a game.
parker I love games!
phoebe_buffay Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
parker Or...Jenga.
phoebe_buffay But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
parker I lose, now Jenga.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Oh my God!
parker Is something wrong?
phoebe_buffay Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
parker Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
phoebe_buffay You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
parker I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
phoebe_buffay No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
parker So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
phoebe_buffay Much less happy!
parker Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
phoebe_buffay So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
parker Isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?
phoebe_buffay Uh huh.
dr_ross_geller ...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
rachel_green Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
dr_ross_geller But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
rachel_green It was really fun being married to you tonight.
dr_ross_geller Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
rachel_green Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green That proposal, at the planetarium
dr_ross_geller I know, I know it was stupid.
rachel_green Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
dr_ross_geller No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
rachel_green Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
dr_ross_geller It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night
rachel_green Goodnight
dr_ross_geller Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
rachel_green I will think about it.
dr_ross_geller That's all I'm askin'
monica_geller Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
dr_ross_geller Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
monica_geller Oh, come on.
dr_ross_geller Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
monica_geller Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
