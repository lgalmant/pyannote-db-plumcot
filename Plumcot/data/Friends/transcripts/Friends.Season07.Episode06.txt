monica_geller Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.

rachel_green Me too!
monica_geller First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me
rachel_green Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
monica_geller Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
phoebe_buffay Yes!!! Oh!!
rachel_green Hypothetically!
phoebe_buffay Still.
monica_geller If Phoebe were my maid of honor
rachel_green Uh-hmm.
monica_geller Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
rachel_green Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
monica_geller Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
phoebe_buffay Wh-why is that the best part?
monica_geller Because then I don't have to!
rachel_green Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that

phoebe_buffay But why does it even matter?!
rachel_green Why does it matter so much to you?!

rachel_green What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
phoebe_buffay You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
rachel_green Yeah but Phoebe
phoebe_buffay And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.

chandler_bing That's sweet.
monica_geller No, it's more like a good luck.
chandler_bing So uh, what did this woman look like?
monica_geller She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
chandler_bing Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
monica_geller Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
chandler_bing No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
monica_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
monica_geller Oh my God yes! Who is she?
chandler_bing Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
monica_geller Did you break up with her?
chandler_bing No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
monica_geller Why?
chandler_bing Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow
monica_geller Fat?!
chandler_bing I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
monica_geller You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
chandler_bing Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
monica_geller Well, apparently she does.
chandler_bing Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
joey_tribbiani Hey! What's going on?
rachel_green Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
rachel_green You have been maid of honor before?!!
phoebe_buffay See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
rachel_green All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
phoebe_buffay Na-uh, I am!
rachel_green How come you are?!
phoebe_buffay Because I cared enough to lie!
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
phoebe_buffay What are you talking about?
joey_tribbiani Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
phoebe_buffay Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
phoebe_buffay Well, it's better than us deciding.
rachel_green Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
phoebe_buffay No! Coins hate me!
rachel_green Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
phoebe_buffay Hey there, you handsome thing.
dr_ross_geller Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
dr_ross_geller Just uh, brought back your videos.
joey_tribbiani Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
dr_ross_geller No! No we don't!
joey_tribbiani Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
dr_ross_geller I... I don't know what you are talking about.
joey_tribbiani Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
dr_ross_geller I've had better.
joey_tribbiani Okay! When?!
dr_ross_geller All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh!
dr_ross_geller I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
joey_tribbiani I want to do it again.
dr_ross_geller We can't do it again.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
dr_ross_geller Because it's weird!
joey_tribbiani Fine! Do you want something to drink?
dr_ross_geller Sure, what do you got?
joey_tribbiani Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
monica_geller Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
chandler_bing Can you figure out what I'm doing?
monica_geller You're Lewis Posin.
chandler_bing Who?
monica_geller Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
chandler_bing Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
monica_geller No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
chandler_bing What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
monica_geller No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
chandler_bing Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
joey_tribbiani Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
dr_ross_geller No, 10 is the highest.
joey_tribbiani Why is 10 the highest?
dr_ross_geller Because it's the highest. Okay, Rachel you're up first. Situation No. 1: You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
joey_tribbiani I don't want to marry Chandler!
rachel_green Okay, uh
joey_tribbiani I've got cold feet.
rachel_green ...it's gonna be okay!
joey_tribbiani No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
rachel_green Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
joey_tribbiani Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
rachel_green Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Yes, very nice Rachel.
rachel_green Thank you judges.
phoebe_buffay Ugh, what a kiss ass.
rachel_green Oh!
joey_tribbiani Okay, Phoebe
phoebe_buffay Yes! Your honor?
joey_tribbiani We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
dr_ross_geller When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
phoebe_buffay Oh!
joey_tribbiani Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
rachel_green Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
dr_ross_geller It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
rachel_green Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre
dr_ross_geller Go!
rachel_green Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Oh! That's nice.
rachel_green Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
joey_tribbiani Wow. Good speech.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it really was!
rachel_green Aw, thanks!
dr_ross_geller Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
joey_tribbiani And she's back in the game.
chandler_bing Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
julie_graff Hello Skidmark.
chandler_bing It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
monica_geller It's pretty clear.
chandler_bing Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
julie_graff That's why you broke up with me?
chandler_bing You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
joey_tribbiani All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
phoebe_buffay Really?! I won!
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
rachel_green Well then I demand a recount!
dr_ross_geller Actually, it wasn't that close.
rachel_green No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
phoebe_buffay The coins have finally forgiven me!
rachel_green Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
phoebe_buffay Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
joey_tribbiani Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
dr_ross_geller Why-why would I care about that?
joey_tribbiani No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
chandler_bing As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
monica_geller Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
chandler_bing I would really love it if could do both.
monica_geller All right, I...I have to ask.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
chandler_bing What?!
monica_geller Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
chandler_bing A hundred and forty-five pounds.
monica_geller In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
chandler_bing Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
monica_geller Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
chandler_bing Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
monica_geller How?
chandler_bing You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
monica_geller What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
chandler_bing Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
monica_geller Keep going.
chandler_bing So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
monica_geller Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
chandler_bing I'd carry you around in my pocket.
monica_geller I love you.
chandler_bing Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
rachel_green Hi Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
rachel_green Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
phoebe_buffay That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
rachel_green Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah!
rachel_green Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case
phoebe_buffay Oh that's so sweet thanks.
rachel_green Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
phoebe_buffay Ohh.
rachel_green And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
phoebe_buffay This stuff is great!
rachel_green Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah
phoebe_buffay Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
rachel_green You do? Why?
phoebe_buffay Because I think it means more to you.
rachel_green But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
phoebe_buffay Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
rachel_green No, I was ten. I just developed early.
phoebe_buffay Man alive!
monica_geller Hey, what's going on?
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
monica_geller Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
rachel_green Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
joey_tribbiani Great nap.
dr_ross_geller It really was.
joey_tribbiani Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
dr_ross_geller Excuse me.
