ross Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
monica Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
chandler Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
rachel Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'
ross Rach, did you proofread these?
rachel Uh... yeah, why?
ross Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
rachel Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
joey Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.
monica Hey, guys.
chandler_and_ross Hey.
rachel Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
monica Lots of responses.
rachel : Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
phoebe : Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
rachel : We have apple cinnamon...
monica : OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
phoebe Wow!
rachel What?
phoebe : Your Visa bill is huge!
rachel Give me that!
chandler You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
ross I don't know.
chandler Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
ross No, it's not just that. It's just-I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
chandler ..little playthings with yarn?
ross What?
chandler Could you want her more?
ross Who?
chandler Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
ross Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
rachel Hi! How are you?
ross We're fine, we're fine.
rachel OK.
joey Shut up!
chandler We're not-we're not saying anything.
phoebe What?
ross Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
joey Thank you.
chandler We were playing poker, alright...
joey There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
ross Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
chandler And then he did.
rachel Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
phoebe Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
ross No, women are welcome to play.
phoebe Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
chandler There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
joey Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
girls Oh, yeah, right.
monica Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
rachel Really.
monica I mean, that's a typical guy response.
ross Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
girls No.
rachel But you could teach us.
guys No.
chandler OK, so now we draw cards.
monica So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
rachel Oh, good for you!
phoebe Congratulations!
chandler OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
phoebe OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
ross No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't-you can't do...
rachel Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
ross No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
rachel Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
ross Oh, you're...
monica Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
phoebe_and_rachel OOooooo!
joey Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
chandler OK, so at this point, the dealer...
monica Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
ross Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
phoebe But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
chandler OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
monica Dammit, dammit, dammit!
phoebe : Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
joey About what?
phoebe About how good your cards were.
joey Heh... I was bluffing.
phoebe A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
rachel OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
guys Whoa, whoa, whoa!
chandler Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
rachel Settle what?
chandler The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
ross The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
rachel Oh. Right.
joey You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
monica Hell no, we'll pay!
phoebe OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
monica And you know what? We want a rematch.
ross Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
rachel : So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
ross ..Yeah.
chandler Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
ross Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
joey ..Yeah?
ross I'm not a nice guy.
ross Alright boys, let's eat.
chandler Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
ross You still on that?
chandler Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
ross You are way off, pal.
joey No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
ross Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time-not any more. I just-I...
ross Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
ross You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK-if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
rachel Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
monica Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
phoebe Ha. Ha, ha.
monica What?
phoebe Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
monica Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
rachel Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
monica That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
rachel Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
monica You're kidding! Where? Where?
rachel : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
monica Oh, Rachel!
phoebe Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
monica Well, what's the job?
rachel Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
monica OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
aunt_iris Is Tony Randall dead?
rachel No.
monica I don't think so.
rachel Why?
aunt_iris Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
monica What?
rachel Oh my God!
monica Really?
aunt_iris No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
phoebe Thank y...
aunt_iris Girls, sit down.
monica Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
aunt_iris Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
phoebe Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
ross Alright.
ross I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
rachel Hi!
ross Hey.
rachel Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
chandler Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
rachel Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and-oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
all That's great! That's wonderful!
rachel Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
monica OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
joey Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
chandler Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
monica Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
phoebe_and_rachel Yes, we should. I think we should.
ross Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
rachel No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
ross Alright.
rachel Alright...
ross So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
joey But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
phoebe Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
joey What?
phoebe Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
chandler That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
ross Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
rachel Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
monica You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
rachel Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
ross So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
rachel Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
monica OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
phoebe Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
monica Excuse me, where are you going?
ross Uh... to the bathroom.
monica Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
ross I want to go to the bathroom.
joey Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
rachel Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
joey That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
monica Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
phoebe Yes!.. or no.
ross Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
rachel Your fly is open, Geller.
phoebe You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
chandler Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
