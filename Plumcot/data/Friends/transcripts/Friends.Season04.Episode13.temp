chandler Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
ross People can hear you.
chandler I know!!
chandler Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
ross Yeah.
kathys_costar Hi!
kathy Hi!
ross That is one good looking man!
chandler Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
kathys_costar Sooo, you've been doing this long?
kathy No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
kathys_costar Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
ross Dude!
kathys_costar Is that an expensive blouse?
kathy If you want it to be.
ross Here's your girlfriend's button.
phoebe Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
monica Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
phoebe Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
monica Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
rachel Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
monica Oh my God, are you out of a job?
rachel No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
phoebe Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
rachel Uh-huh.
phoebe That sounds great!
joey Hey!
monica Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
joey There's gravy?
monica If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
monica What are you doing?
joey I think I left a donut up here.
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey!
phoebe Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
ross Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
chandler Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
phoebe That's a good idea for a business!
chandler I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
joey That-that is a good trick.
chandler All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
joey Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
ross Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
joey Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
ross Yeah.
phoebe Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
ross They're not a couple!
phoebe Oh-okay, I get the game now.
joey Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
ross Oh yeah!
joey Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
chandler Really?
joey Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
ross No.
joey Noooo!!
chandler So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
ross Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
chandler Yeah, I know but
ross Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
monica Hey!
joey Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
monica You made pancakes?
joey Yep! Grab a plate.
monica Okay.
joey No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
chandler Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
joey Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
ross Oh yeah!
monica Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
joey Oh yeah, who's playing?
monica The players.
ross Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
monica Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
joey All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
phoebe Oh.
rachel Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
mr_waltham In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
rachel Hi!
joshua Hi, I'm Joshua.
rachel Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
joshua Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife
rachel Oh, I'm so sorry.
joshua Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
rachel Well, at least that's a great suit.
joshua Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
rachel Okay.
mr_waltham Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
rachel No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
rachel Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
joshua It's this way? Sorry.
chandler I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
ross All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
chandler Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
ross Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
kathy Hey you guys!
ross Hey!
kathy Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
ross Oh, absolutely!
kathy Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
kathy It's a good play, isn't it?
chandler Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
ross Okay, I
kathy Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
chandler Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
kathy Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
chandler Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
kathy Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
chandler Well, you can understand, given how we started.
kathy Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
chandler Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
kathy I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
chandler Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
rachel I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
phoebe Rachel has a new doll.
rachel Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
ross Uh, hello!
rachel Hi-e!!
phoebe Ooh, what do I smell?
joey I don't know, it smells good.
monica Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
phoebe Ooh!
monica Please, have some!
ross Oh, yumm!
monica Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
joey Wow! The new Playboy!
monica Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
ross Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
phoebe What? What?
rachel Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
ross Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
rachel It's Joshua.
ross Oh, whatever.
monica Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
phoebe Well, I hate to eat and run, but
monica No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
phoebe Yeah, I don't need it.
monica People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
rachel Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
monica I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
phoebe Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
monica 'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
phoebe If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
rachel Yeah, that's true.
monica All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
phoebe Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
chandler Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
all What?!
ross So you were right?
chandler I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
ross Chandler!
rachel Chandler, what did she say?
phoebe Wait a minute.
joey Come here.
monica Are you sure?
chandler Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's
rachel Beefsteak Charlie's?
chandler Yes! See you and I have always been like-
rachel Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
monica Nah, I got it.
rachel Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
rachel Hi!
all Hey!
rachel So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
phoebe Why don't you ask him out?
joey Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
rachel Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
joey Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
phoebe He just got a divorce right?
rachel Hmm-mmm.
phoebe So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
rachel Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
phoebe You've never asked a guy out?!!
rachel No. Have you?
phoebe Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
rachel I don't even know how I would go about it.
joey Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
phoebe Oh, please!
joey Hey, how you doin'?
rachel You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
phoebe I've never done that.
rachel Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
joey Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
rachel Really?! You think that will work?
joey Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
joey What the heck is that?
chandler Did she call?
phoebe No, sorry.
chandler All right, maybe I should call her.
joey No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
ross He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
chandler Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
ross How might you be wrong?
chandler Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
joey Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
chandler She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
ross That's all you're basing this on?
chandler That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
joey Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
chandler Oh my God!!
rachel Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
joshua What do you think?
rachel Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
joshua Huh. Yeah?
rachel Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
joshua I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
rachel Great.
joshua All right, thank you so much for all your help.
rachel Sure.
joshua Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
rachel Yeah-eah-ha!
joshua Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
rachel Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
joshua Ah, that's okay, thanks.
rachel Okay.
joshua Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
rachel Basketball!
joshua I'm sorry.
rachel I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
joshua Wow! That would be great.
rachel Really?
joshua Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
mr_waltham Good morning.
joshua Hi!
kathy Hey.
chandler Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
kathy Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
chandler Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
kathy Yeah.
chandler Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
joey Okay, for next time, what do you say?
rachel I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
ross So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
rachel He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
monica Okay, it's ready. Come on.
joey What's ready?
monica Just come.
ross Oh my God!
rachel Wow! Monica!
phoebe Great!
ross This is beautiful!
phoebe Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
monica Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
joey I don't know, it looks the same.
monica You used to have carpet.
joey Oh yeah!
monica So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
ross Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
monica Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
ross Hey!
joey How'd it go?
chandler Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
phoebe Oh good!
chandler She is now.
ross What are you saying?
chandler I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
phoebe How? How is your fault?
chandler Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
rachel Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
ross Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
mr_waltham Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
rachel Really?
mr_waltham Will you call him?
rachel Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
