monica Tell him.
rachel No.
phoebe Tell him, tell him.
monica Just...please tell him.
rachel Shut up!
chandler Tell me what?
monica Look at you, you won't even look at him.
chandler Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
rachel All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
phoebe Doing it on this table.
chandler Wow!
joey Exellent dream score.
ross Why, why, why would you dream that?
chandler More importantly, was I any good?
rachel Well, you were pretty damn good.
chandler Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
rachel Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
ross I love it, when we share.
chandler You're okay there?
ross I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
chandler I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
chandler Hello Rachel.
rachel Get off.
phoebe Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
joey I don't know. What are you wearing?
ross Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
phoebe Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
chandler Pirates again?
phoebe No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
joey Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
chandler Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
phoebe What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
chandler Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
phoebe I could be a secretary.
chandler Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
phoebe I could do that.
rachel What are you playing with?
ross Oh, it's my new beeper.
joey What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
monica Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
ross No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
chandler A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
monica All right, I'll see you guys later.
rachel Off to see young Ethan?
monica Thank you.
joey How young is young Ethan? Young?
monica He's... our age.
chandler When we were?
monica Okay, he's a senior in college.
ross College?
chandler Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
monica No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
all What?
monica Oh, I can't pass for 22?
phoebe Well, maybe 25-26.
monica I am 26.
phoebe There you go.
chandler Can you hear that?
phoebe Yeah?
chandler See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
phoebe Oh. Uh, I'm on.
phoebe Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
chandler I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
phoebe Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
chandler What?
phoebe Ross says hi.
chandler Ah!
phoebe This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
chandler Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
phoebe Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
chandler Okay.
phoebe All right. Bye bye.
chandler Bye bye.
chandler Yes?
phoebe Whatcha doin'?
chandler Ooh.
monica Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
rachel Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
monica What?
rachel Could tonight be the Night?
monica I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
rachel So, did you shave your legs?
monica Yeah.
rachel A-ha!
joey Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
ross Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
joey All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
ross Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andrá is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
joey Services? Oh, services.
ross Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
joey Hey, hey. How was the first day?
phoebe Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
chandler See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
phoebe No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
chandler Why not?
phoebe Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
chandler What?!
phoebe I thought you knew that.
chandler Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
phoebe Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
chandler What are you talking about?
phoebe Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
chandler I can't belive it.
phoebe Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
chandler They do me?
phoebe You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
chandler I don't sound like that.
ross Oh, oh Chandler...
joey Oh... Yeah, you do.
ross 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
joey My scones.
phoebe_joey_and_ross 'My scones.'
chandler Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
chandler That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
monica Did not.
young_ethan I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
monica How was that possible?
young_ethan Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
monica Okay.
young_ethan Okay.
monica Unless...
young_ethan What?
monica Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
young_ethan Yeah, I'd really like that.
young_ethan Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
monica Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
young_ethan Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
monica Ethan?
young_ethan Yeah?
monica Are you a virgin?
young_ethan Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
monica Really?
young_ethan Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
young_ethan Wow!
monica You keep saying that.
young_ethan You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
monica Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
young_ethan Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
monica No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
young_ethan Oh.
monica Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
young_ethan Huh!
monica But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
young_ethan Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
monica You're not a senior?
young_ethan Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
monica Ok...ay.
monica What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
young_ethan I just had sex.
monica Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
young_ethan Well, you never told me how old you were.
monica Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
young_ethan I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
monica Don't say it.
young_ethan ..in love with you.
monica Really?
young_ethan Sorry.
monica Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
young_ethan Who?
ross Okay, Andrá should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
chandler Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
rachel No, forget it.
chandler Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
rachel All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
joey All right.
ross Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
rachel No.
ross You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
rachel No, it was just the three of us.
ross Huh!
joey So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
rachel You know what?
joey What?
rachel There were times when it wasn't even me.
phoebe That is so sweet, you guys.
ross_rachel_and_phoebe Hey, Mon.
rachel Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
all Mon!
monica What?
rachel Ethan called again.
monica Oh.
ross Are you not seeing him anymore?
monica No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
chandler And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
rachel I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
joey Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
ross Oh, yeah.
monica Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
joey_chander_and_ross Sorry.
ross It's morphin time!
joey Stegosaurus!
chandler Tyrannosaurus!
phoebe Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
rachel Where are you going?
phoebe Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
chandler Work people? Nobody told me.
phoebe No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
chandler You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
phoebe Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
chandler You think I should?
phoebe I really do, yeah.
chandler Okay.
phoebe Okay.
chandler Okay.
phoebe Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
chandler I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
phoebe You were great. But they still made fun of you.
chandler What?
phoebe You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
chandler Then, I don't get it.
phoebe Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
chandler They do?
phoebe Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
chandler I just wan't to...
phoebe No, but you can't.
chandler But I just wa...
phoebe Uh uh.
monica Aren't you gonna...
ross Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
joey What about Andrá?
ross Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
young_ethan Hey.
monica That was gonna be my opener.
rachel Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
ross I thought that was just a rumour.
rachel True story.
joey They're here already?
young_ethan All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
monica It was.
young_ethan Then, what's the problem?
monica Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
young_ethan Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
monica This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
young_ethan No, don't say it.
monica ..love you.
ross Are you're hands still wet?
joey Uh, moist, yeah.
rachel Let's dry 'em again.
