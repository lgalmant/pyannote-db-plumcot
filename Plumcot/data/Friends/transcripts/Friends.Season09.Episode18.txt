joey_tribbiani Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
monica_geller Ok.
joey_tribbiani Alright!
monica_geller But ehm...what is it not?
joey_tribbiani A place to entertain my lady friends.
monica_geller And what else is it not?
joey_tribbiani A place to eat spaghetti.
monica_geller Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
joey_tribbiani Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
rachel_green Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
joey_tribbiani Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
monica_geller Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
joey_tribbiani Uh!
monica_geller Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
chandler_bing Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
phoebe_buffay Hey will you get me tickets too?
rachel_green Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
dr_ross_geller No thanks!
phoebe_buffay You don't wanna win the lottery?
dr_ross_geller Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
chandler_bing Still on Amelia Earhart?
dr_ross_geller The woman just vanished!
joey_tribbiani Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
dr_ross_geller No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
chandler_bing Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
joey_tribbiani I like those odds!
dr_ross_geller Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
chandler_bing I'll ask. Boohaki?
dr_ross_geller Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
rachel_green Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
monica_geller How do you know she's gonna start talking?
rachel_green Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
chandler_bing Kinda like Joey.
joey_tribbiani What's that now?
monica_geller God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
chandler_bing Pie eating contest?
monica_geller Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
chandler_bing No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
monica_geller That was a good day!
dr_ross_geller They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
monica_geller I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
dr_ross_geller They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
joey_tribbiani Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
rachel_green Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
joey_tribbiani I was?
rachel_green Yes and you talked to her...
joey_tribbiani I did?
rachel_green She dropped off a casserole?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
monica_geller So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
chandler_bing Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
dr_ross_geller Think he washed his hands?
chandler_bing Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
rachel_green What's going on?
monica_geller Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
joey_tribbiani Ooh! Tough odds!
dr_ross_geller Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
joey_tribbiani Look who's coming around!
chandler_bing Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
joey_tribbiani Did you get it?
chandler_bing One of the slots got filled.
joey_tribbiani By you!?
chandler_bing Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
monica_geller Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
chandler_bing Yeah I know.
rachel_green Well, there's two spots left right?
chandler_bing Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
monica_geller Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
dr_ross_geller A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
monica_geller Alright, who wants to do it?
phoebe_buffay Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
monica_geller Ok, hey Rach?
rachel_green Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
joey_tribbiani I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
phoebe_buffay I hope I win!
monica_geller Well, it doesn't really matter.. you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
joey_tribbiani I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
monica_geller Right!. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
joey_tribbiani Can't really say!
monica_geller I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
joey_tribbiani I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
chandler_bing@monica_geller@rachel_green Please, just do it!
phoebe_buffay One, two, three!
joey_tribbiani I won, hey!
dr_ross_geller You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
rachel_green You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
dr_ross_geller Uh, you're not gonna win.
rachel_green Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
dr_ross_geller Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
chandler_bing I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
dr_ross_geller Why would I eat my own arm?
chandler_bing Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
monica_geller You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
dr_ross_geller Why?
monica_geller Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
dr_ross_geller You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
phoebe_buffay Get a room!
chandler_bing Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, probably just invest it.
chandler_bing Ooh! Calm down..
joey_tribbiani Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
joey_tribbiani Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
rachel_green I don't really care about the Knicks.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
rachel_green You would do that? I never get picked!
chandler_bing You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
joey_tribbiani You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
chandler_bing You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
dr_ross_geller Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
chandler_bing I'll take this one too Uh.. Mommy?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not..
rachel_green I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
dr_ross_geller Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
phoebe_buffay Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
dr_ross_geller I.. I was just talking about Rachel.
phoebe_buffay Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
dr_ross_geller Well that depends.. have you been a baaad gi. no I can't.
chandler_bing Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear?.. What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!!. Alright, bye.
joey_tribbiani Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
chandler_bing Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
monica_geller Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
chandler_bing He's the boss's son.
monica_geller Come on, lottery!!
rachel_green Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
monica_geller Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
rachel_green Ooh, I have another idea!
monica_geller I'm sorry, idea time is over.
phoebe_buffay Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
monica_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
monica_geller There are no tickets on the nightstand!
chandler_bing Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
monica_geller Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
chandler_bing Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
monica_geller Chandler, sense the tone!!
rachel_green Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
monica_geller Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
monica_geller Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
dr_ross_geller 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important..
joey_tribbiani I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
monica_geller When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
joey_tribbiani I'll show you how.
rachel_green Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
monica_geller Please.. if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
rachel_green Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
chandler_bing She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us..
monica_geller Ahhh!
chandler_bing Let me finish.. however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
monica_geller There's the man I married!!
rachel_green All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
monica_geller Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
rachel_green OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
dr_ross_geller Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together
monica_geller No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
joey_tribbiani Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
chandler_bing Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
rachel_green Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
joey_tribbiani Oh!
phoebe_buffay OOOOOHHHHH!
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey!!
phoebe_buffay OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
rachel_green Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
joey_tribbiani No, no!
phoebe_buffay If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets!
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 NO!!
phoebe_buffay Don't come any closer!
chandler_bing Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
phoebe_buffay No, what's more important, your friends or money?
everyone_but_monica#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 Friends!
monica_geller Money! Friends...
phoebe_buffay Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
monica_geller They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra..
dr_ross_geller Monica!
phoebe_buffay Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
dr_ross_geller Go, go, go!!
phoebe_buffay What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
monica_geller Phoebe, we lost half of them.
phoebe_buffay So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
dr_ross_geller Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
phoebe_buffay As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
chandler_bing Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
monica_geller Oh, play them!
chandler_bing Ok, here we go!
message#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise" "I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."
phoebe_buffay Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
second_message#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
chandler_bing This is..shhh!
second_message#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 "Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want."
monica_geller Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
all@ Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
rachel_green Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
chandler_bing Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
rachel_green No, she was just much better at job than me!
phoebe_buffay Guys, the drawing is about to start!
rachel_green You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
monica_geller Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
chandler_bing Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
monica_geller 131!
dr_ross_geller Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
rachel_green Hi mum, put her back on!
joey_tribbiani Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
tv#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
chandler_bing I got that!
dr_ross_geller Oh, we have one too!!
monica_geller We are on a roll, people!!
dr_ross_geller Come on!!
rachel_green Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
tv#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
monica_geller Check your numbers! Make me rich!
rachel_green Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
all@ Wow!
joey_tribbiani And what did she say?
rachel_green She said "gleba"!!
monica_geller Make me rich!!
rachel_green Isn't that amazing?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
rachel_green Why-why aren't you more excited?
dr_ross_geller Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
rachel_green Oh, but of course it is!
dr_ross_geller Okay, what does it mean?
rachel_green I don't know all the words.
dr_ross_geller I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words
dr_ross_geller Yes you did, gleba is a word!
dr_ross_geller Ok, use it in a sentence.
rachel_green Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
dr_ross_geller It's not a word!
rachel_green Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
rachel_green Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
dr_ross_geller She's gonna be a scientist!
joey_tribbiani Damnit! anybody got anything?
chandler_bing No.
phoebe_buffay I'm still looking through mine...
monica_geller Just double checking..no, no, no... No!
monica_geller Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
chandler_bing Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
steve Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
chandler_bing Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
steve Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
chandler_bing Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
steve Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
chandler_bing Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow
chandler_bing What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
everybody#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode18 Oh my God, congratulations!
monica_geller Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
chandler_bing Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
monica_geller You bet! No TV or anything!
joey_tribbiani Hey, that is so great about the job.
chandler_bing Thanks, man.
joey_tribbiani And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
chandler_bing Really? What?
joey_tribbiani Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
chandler_bing Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah.
rachel_green You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
dr_ross_geller Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
phoebe_buffay You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller Seven.
phoebe_buffay We won.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay We won!
monica_geller Let me see!
phoebe_buffay Don't tear it.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
phoebe_buffay I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
chandler_bing Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
phoebe_buffay I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
rachel_green So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
phoebe_buffay It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
monica_geller You know what? You can have mine.
chandler_bing Me too.
joey_tribbiani Me too.
rachel_green Me too.
dr_ross_geller I guess if everybody else is...
joey_tribbiani Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
phoebe_buffay I beg to differ
gunther Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000
phoebe_buffay Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her.
