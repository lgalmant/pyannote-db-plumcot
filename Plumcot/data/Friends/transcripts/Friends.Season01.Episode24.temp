ross That would be nice.
rachel Pardon?
chandler Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.

chandler Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
joey I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
chandler .. And where's this money coming from?
joey Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
ross What kind of research?
joey Oh, just, y'know.... science.
ross Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
joey .. It's a fertility study.
monica Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
joey Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
ross Hey.
phoebe Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
monica OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...

joey Oh, OK.
phoebe So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
joey I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
monica Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
joey What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
monica Man's got a point.
joey Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
chandler Crazy bitch.
joey Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
monica Joey... we always know what you mean.
phoebe Hey.
monica Hey.
ross Hey.
phoebe How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
ross I'm going to China.
phoebe Jeez, you say one thing, and...
monica You're going to China?
ross Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo-it's-it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary Um... here's a picture of me...
phoebe Oh, let me see!
ross : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
monica Yeah.
phoebe Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
ross Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
monica Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
ross Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
monica You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
ross No.
phoebe Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
ross At the coffeehouse, right.
phoebe So you do know who he is! Sorry.
ross OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
phoebe Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
ross Hi.
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross ...I have to go to China.
joey The country?
ross No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
chandler Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
ross Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
joey Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
chandler Forget about her.
joey He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
chandler Course there, they just call it food.
ross Yeah... I guess. I don't-I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
joey Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
ross I know.
joey We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
chandler I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
melanie Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
joey Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
chandler Ooooh.
monica OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
rachel Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
monica Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
joey Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
joey Then you do. Heh, heh.
monica So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
joey What do you mean?
monica Y'know, just be there for her.
joey Not following you.
monica Think about it.
rachel OK, I'm guessing this is from...
rachel Well, thank you, Melanie.
chandler OK, this one right here is from me.
rachel OK... ah, it's light.....it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
rachel This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
phoebe Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
joey : That book got me through some tough times.
melanie There is a little child inside this man!
chandler Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
rachel Who's this from?
chandler Oh, that's Ross's.
rachel Oh..... Oh my God. He remembered.
phoebe Remembered what?
rachel It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
chandler Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
phoebe Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
monica I can't believe he did this.
chandler Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
rachel What did you just say?
chandler ahem... um... Crystal duck.
rachel No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
chandler F-hah.... flennin....
rachel Oh.... my God.
chandler Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
joey That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
rachel I mean, this is unbelievable.
phoebe I know. This is really, really huge.
chandler No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
phoebe Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
chandler OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
monica I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
rachel No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
joey Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
rachel Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
chandler H-He's in China!
joey The country.
monica No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
chandler What about the time difference?
monica From here to the airport?
chandler Yes! You're never gonna make it!
monica Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
rachel I-I-I don't know.
chandler Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
joey He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
monica Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
rachel I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
phoebe Here, look, alright, does this help?
rachel Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
chandler Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
flight_attendant Alright!
ross Ni-chou chi-ma!
rachel Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
flight_attendant Hi!
rachel Hi.
flight_attendant May I see your boarding pass?
rachel Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
flight_attendant Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
rachel No, I know, but I-he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
flight_attendant No no no! Federal regulations!
rachel OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
flight_attendant Alright. What's the message?
rachel Uh... I don't know.
flight_attendant Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
man What?
flight_attendant It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
man : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
melanie Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
joey Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
melanie Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
joey Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
melanie M-Me again?
joey Sure! Why not?
melanie Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
melanie Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
joey How do you mean?
melanie I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
monica Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
rachel I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
monica_and_phoebe Sure.
rachel I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
monica Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
phoebe Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
monica Another good point.
phoebe No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
rachel Huh?
phoebe Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
monica Why isn't it working out?
rachel I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
monica Is he not cute enough for you?
rachel No!
monica Does he not make enough money?
rachel No, I'm just....
phoebe Maybe there's someone else.
rachel Wha...
monica Is there? Is there someone else?
rachel No! There is.. there is noone else!
monica Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
chandler Hey, big...
joey Shhhh!
chandler ..spender.
joey She's still asleep.
chandler So how'd it go?
joey Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
chandler The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
joey Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
chandler Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
joey It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
chandler I didn't know you had another level.
joey I know! Neither did I!
monica Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
rachel Yeah.
monica Oh, from who?
rachel From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
monica Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
rachel Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this-this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
monica Oh, why?
rachel Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
monica No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
rachel Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
monica I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
rachel Who is it?
intercom It's me, Carl.
rachel C'mon up.
monica Behind my brother's back?. is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
joey Seven hundred bucks!
chandler Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
joey Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
chandler Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
joey What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
carl I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
ross I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
rachel Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
ross Fine, just stop thinking about me.
ross Can't do it, can you?
rachel So I'm thinking about you. So what?
ross I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
rachel Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
carl I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
ross Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
rachel Ross, it's too hard.
ross No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
rachel Ross, you're like my best friend.
ross I know.
rachel If we broke up, and I lost you...
ross Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
rachel Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
ross No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
rachel I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
ross Well, start looking.
rachel Wow.
carl Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
rachel Right! You're right!
carl Heh... y'know?
rachel You know what?
carl What?
rachel I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I mean-I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
carl But...
rachel Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
man For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
ross Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
julie Oh, thanks, sweetie.
ross No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
julie Really?
ross Yeah.
julie You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
ross No, no, they will. I just... uh...
ross_and_julie Can't wait.
ross Come on, they're gonna love you.
