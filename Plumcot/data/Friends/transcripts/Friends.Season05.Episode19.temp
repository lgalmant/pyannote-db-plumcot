ross Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
chandler Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
ross Wow! How'd you get in there?
chandler Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
delivery_girl Hi Chandler!
chandler Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
caitlin Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
chandler Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
caitlin It's uh, 27 dollars even.
chandler Oh, okay. Here you go.
caitlin Hey, where's the chicken?
chandler Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
caitlin Great. I'll see you later!
chandler Okay, bye!
ross What the hell was that?!
chandler What?
ross The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
chandler I was not flirting.
ross It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
chandler Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
ross Yeah, right.
chandler You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
ross I'm good.
rachel I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
phoebe I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
rachel No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
phoebe Don't get me started on that.
chandler I was not flirting.
ross And on your anniversary, for shame!
rachel What's going on?
ross Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
chandler I was not and oh God, shh!
ross Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
phoebe Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
ross Well
chandler Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
rachel Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
ross Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
rachel Hm-mmm.
ross And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
rachel Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
phoebe Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
ross This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
phoebe See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
joey Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
rachel Big night!
phoebe This is so cool!
chandler So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
joey Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
chandler I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
joey She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
joey Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so
monica Hey! Happy Anniversary!
chandler Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
monica So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London
chandler Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
monica Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
chandler The one that doesn't.
monica That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
chandler Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
monica That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
chandler Okay.
monica You have got to go home!
phoebe But I like it here!
monica You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
phoebe Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
monica Great!
phoebe Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
rachel Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
joey Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
phoebe I guess so.
rachel Here you go. Thank you!
phoebe Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
rachel Oh what, you-you want both of them?
phoebe Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
rachel Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
phoebe Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
rachel Tell her to wear her own earrings.
phoebe These are her earrings.
rachel Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
phoebe Why not?
rachel Because I lose her stuff!
joey Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
joey Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
chandler If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
monica Rach? What are you doing?
rachel Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
monica It's a diaper commercial.
rachel Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
caitlin Pizza delivery!
ross I'll get it! I will get that!
caitlin Hi!
ross Hi!
caitlin One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
ross Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
caitlin What?!
ross The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
caitlin Oh. Thanks.
ross You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
caitlin Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
chandler Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
caitlin I'm gonna try.
chandler You're welcome.
ross You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
chandler What?
ross This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
monica What's goin' on?
ross Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
chandler Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
monica It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
ross Really?!
chandler Really?!
monica It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
chandler So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
monica Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
chandler Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
joey True story!
monica Chandler, this actually bothers you?
chandler Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
rachel Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
ross And thank you, for that.
rachel But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
ross What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
rachel Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
ross All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
phoebe I found it!
rachel Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
phoebe On your dresser.
rachel Okay that is the one we already have!
joey Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
monica What?
joey Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
chandler Well, what is it?
joey Oh, they cut me out of the show.
rachel What?!
ross Are you sure?
phoebe Maybe your scene's coming up?
joey Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
rachel Yeah.
joey I'm in it.
phoebe This is terrible, what are you going to do?
joey I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
phoebe That's not good.
joey No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
rachel Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
chandler If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
joey Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
grandma_tribbiani No! Sam Waterston!
joey No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
grandma_tribbiani No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
chandler Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
monica Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
phoebe But I already gave them back to you!
monica No you didn't.
phoebe All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
rachel It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
phoebe Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
rachel Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
phoebe Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
ross Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
phoebe Why are you being weird?
ross Do you like it?
phoebe No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
ross Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
phoebe Ohh! I did not get that.
chandler So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
monica Yeah, it's good.
chandler See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
monica Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
chandler Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
monica Go on, teach me something about men and women.
chandler Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
monica No way!
chandler It's true.
monica Well that's pathetic!
chandler Again true.
monica And this goes for all guys?
chandler All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
joey All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
ross Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
joey I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
monica No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
joey Yeah, all right. Ooh!
grandma_tribbiani Joey!
chandler Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
rachel Hey!
phoebe Did you find it?
rachel The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
phoebe Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
rachel Okay, calm down, here they are.
monica Phoebe!
phoebe What are we going to do?!
rachel I don't know, I don't know.
phoebe All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
rachel Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
phoebe I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
rachel Ohh that'd be great!
phoebe Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
monica Yeah, what is it?
phoebe Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
monica Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
phoebe I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
monica All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
phoebe No.
monica Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
phoebe Yeah! You're the best!
rachel Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
monica That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
rachel Your sunglasses?!
monica Yes!
phoebe Oh, right!
caitlin Pizza!

grandma_tribbiani Caitlin!
ross Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
caitlin It's uh, $12.50.
ross Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
caitlin No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
ross Gas? Wow! Intense.
chandler If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
ross Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
caitlin Yeah.
ross They put that in.
caitlin What?!
ross The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
caitlin Well okay!
ross A lot of other gas smells
chandler Oh the humanity.
ross Meth-methane smells
caitlin Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
ross Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
caitlin Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
ross Was I talking to her about gas?
chandler More so than anything else.
phoebe I-I-I found it interesting.
rachel I'm sorry.
ross Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
rachel Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
phoebe Ross?

phoebe What else do they add smell too?
rachel Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
caitlin Oh, is there a problem?
rachel No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
caitlin Oh my God! That was flirting?!
rachel Yeah.
caitlin Wow!
rachel I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
caitlin The guy with the gas?!
rachel Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
caitlin Really?!
rachel Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
caitlin I just, I thought Joey was there.
rachel Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
ross What do you mean?
rachel Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
ross And she just gave you this?
rachel Yeah!
ross Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
rachel I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
