phoebe Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
rachel Hey.
joey Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
chandler Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
monica Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
chandler And twenty-five it is.
joey You gave him cookies?
monica Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
phoebe I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
chandler Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
phoebe Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
ross So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
rachel Uhh, the mailman, the super.
monica Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
joey Oh my God.
rachel What?
joey Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
rachel Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
monica Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
ross Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
joey I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
chandler Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
ross Hey guys.
chandler_monica_and_joey Hey.
ross Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh.
rachel Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
ross How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
gunther Yeah.
ross Here, go nuts.
ross Hey guys.
chandler_monica_and_joey Hey.
chandler What's in the bag?
ross Um, just some presents.
joey C'mon show us what you bought. You know you want to.
ross OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
monica Cute.
ross I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
monica Ross, that is gorgeous!
ross Yeah?
monica Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
phoebe Hey.
gang Hey. Hi Phoebe.
phoebe Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
ross Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
phoebe This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
chandler Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
phoebe No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
rachel Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
phoebe No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
rachel How have you never been on Oprah?
phoebe OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
monica Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
phoebe It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
monica Oh, wait a minute honey.
gang Phoebs.
monica Wow.
joey So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me.
gang Joey!
joey Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
grandmother Esther Livingston. Gone.
grandmother Hi, Phoe.
phoebe Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
grandmother Oh, just updating the phonebook.
phoebe Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
grandmother Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
phoebe Just, you know, to see... um.
grandmother Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. another graduation. another graduation.
phoebe OK, is this really my father?
grandmother Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
phoebe OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
grandmother Look, I.
phoebe Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
grandmother Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
phoebe Oh God.
grandmother It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
phoebe Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
grandmother Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
phoebe OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
grandmother Honey.
phoebe Oh.
grandmother Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
phoebe Oh.
chandler Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
rachel Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
chandler Who said anything about Christmas?
monica Hi.
ross Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
rachel No, nothin'.
monica I hope she's OK.
joey Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
monica How do you know exactly what she's going through?
joey She told us.
chandler So whaddya got there Monica?
monica Just some stuff for the party.
ross Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
monica You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
chandler Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
rachel Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
monica Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
joey Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
ross Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
rachel Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of.
ross C'mon Rachel.
rachel OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
ross See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
rachel Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
phoebe Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. OK, um, in Ithica. alright, um, Saratoga. Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
grandmother Hey.
phoebe Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
grandmother C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
phoebe Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
grandmother Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
phoebe No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
grandmother I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
phoebe Whattaya mean?
grandmother He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
phoebe Wow. Thank you.
grandmother Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
phoebe Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa!
joey Phoebe here with the cab yet?
chandler Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. hop in.
joey Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
chandler Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
joey Hey, here she comes.
chandler Hey.
joey Hey.
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey.
phoebe Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
chandler Eeeshk.
joey Yeah, big stuff.
phoebe OK, let's go.
chandler OK.
phoebe Alright, here, you have to hold this.
chandler OK. Brake left, gas right?
phoebe Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
chandler Where's my seat belt?
phoebe Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
chandler Hey!
joey Hey.
ross C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
monica For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
rachel Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
monica Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
ross Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and.
monica Ross, the heat!
ross Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. off.
rachel Did you just break the radiator?
ross No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. here it is.
monica Well put it back.
ross It uhh, it won't go back.
rachel I'll call the super.
monica Here, let me try.
ross Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
monica Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
rachel Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes,
ross OK, tip the man.
monica No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
ross Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
phoebe Ooh, this is it, 74.
chandler Oh, so that's what this is for.
phoebe Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
chandler Yeah.
joey Sure is.
phoebe OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
chandler Alright.
joey Good luck Phoebs.
phoebe OK, here I go. here I go. I'm goin'.
rachel Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
ross It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
monica Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
ross Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
monica Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.

ross Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
monica No, I will not cave.
rachel Yeah, I'm with Mon.
ross Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
mr_treeger Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
ross No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
mr_treeger No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
monica Ross.
ross Yeah.
monica Looks like he's playin' baseball.
ross You mean hardball?
monica Whatever.
rachel What'cha gonna' do?
ross Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
mr_treeger No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
monica So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
mr_treeger Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
rachel Nice seizing. gel boy.
mr_treeger So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
rachel Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
mr_treeger Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
rachel Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
phoebe OK.

chandler Alright, we're gettin' closer.
phoebe Uh-huh.
joey Phoebs, what's goin' on?
phoebe No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and.
joey Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
phoebe Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
chandler Well, so why not go knock?
phoebe Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
joey Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
phoebe Yeah?
chandler Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
joey Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
phoebe You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
chandler Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
joey Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
chandler Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
joey Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
monica Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
ross Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
phoebe Oh, I couldn't go in.
monica Honey, I'm sorry.
ross Are you OK?
phoebe Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
chandler Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
joey Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
joey Rach, these are for you.
rachel Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
joey No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
chandler OK, Phoebs, your turn.
phoebe Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
joey Uh-huh.
phoebe You guuuyys.
joey And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
ross You got me a cola drink?
chandler And, a lemon lime.
