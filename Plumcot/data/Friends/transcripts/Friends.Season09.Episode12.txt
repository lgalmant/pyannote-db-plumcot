chandler_bing Hey
joey_tribbiani Hey. So where's Mon?
chandler_bing Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
joey_tribbiani And you're not helping?
chandler_bing I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
dr_ross_geller Hey you guys!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey! Happy birthday..
rachel_green Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
dr_ross_geller Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly Molly, Chandler, Joey.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hi.
molly Hi.
dr_ross_geller Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
joey_tribbiani You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
rachel_green Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
molly No, you stay, I'll do it
rachel_green OK, thank you.
molly Nice to meet you guys
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you too.
rachel_green Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
rachel_green What? You really think she's hot?
chandler_bing Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
rachel_green And Joey?
joey_tribbiani How do you think she's doing?
rachel_green Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
dr_ross_geller Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I...
rachel_green Thank you!
chandler_bing Now that Rachel's gone?
rachel_green So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
phoebe_buffay Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
mike_hannigan Lima.
phoebe_buffay No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
mike_hannigan You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". Oh god! Oh!
phoebe_buffay What?
mike_hannigan OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
phoebe_buffay Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
mike_hannigan What, is he your pet rat?
phoebe_buffay Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
mike_hannigan You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
phoebe_buffay What are those?
mike_hannigan I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
phoebe_buffay OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
mike_hannigan Thank you.
phoebe_buffay So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
rachel_green Hello.
gavin_mitchell Hello
rachel_green Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
gavin_mitchell For what?
rachel_green Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious..
gavin_mitchell Is this your first appology?
rachel_green No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
heather Good morning!
rachel_green Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy.. I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
gavin_mitchell What?
rachel_green I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
gavin_mitchell I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
rachel_green Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
gavin_mitchell Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
rachel_green Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
gavin_mitchell I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
rachel_green That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
gavin_mitchell Huh. What's Tag's last name?
rachel_green It was.. oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
gavin_mitchell But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
rachel_green Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous.. Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
gavin_mitchell It was Jones.
rachel_green Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
joey_tribbiani Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
molly You mean, when you were a baby.
joey_tribbiani Sure.
monica_geller Would you stop staring at her?
chandler_bing I wasn't staring. I was leering.
monica_geller What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
chandler_bing Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
monica_geller Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
molly I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
dr_ross_geller Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou..
molly Bye
monica_geller They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
molly I think it's sweet.
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
rachel_green Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
rachel_green Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
joey_tribbiani So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
dr_ross_geller Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
joey_tribbiani Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
dr_ross_geller What are you, a child?
joey_tribbiani Yes!
dr_ross_geller Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
joey_tribbiani Fine.
monica_geller Take me home!
phoebe_buffay Hey Mikey
mike_hannigan Hey P
phoebe_buffay What are you doing?
mike_hannigan Setting rat traps.
phoebe_buffay To kill Bob??
mike_hannigan No, no, to test his neck strength.
phoebe_buffay No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
mike_hannigan Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
phoebe_buffay I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
mike_hannigan Better think of a new name for him.
phoebe_buffay I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
mike_hannigan I don't know, I mean I'm not sure.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god, we killed Bob!
mike_hannigan Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
phoebe_buffay Suzie?
dr_ross_geller Whazzup??
chandler_bing Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
dr_ross_geller Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
chandler_bing You don't trust him?
dr_ross_geller Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
chandler_bing Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
dr_ross_geller You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
chandler_bing Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
dr_ross_geller Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
chandler_bing Picturing that tree?
dr_ross_geller I am, yes.
chandler_bing Where you going, Joe?
joey_tribbiani For a walk.
chandler_bing Oh. You mind if I join you?
joey_tribbiani Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
chandler_bing Your thoughts? Plural?
joey_tribbiani Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
chandler_bing I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
joey_tribbiani Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like.. like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.. Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
chandler_bing Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
joey_tribbiani Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
chandler_bing Great novels?
joey_tribbiani Fine.. mediocre porn
gavin_mitchell Gavin Mitchelle's office.
rachel_green Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh.. ok then.. I'll pass you back to your son
gavin_mitchell Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary.
rachel_green Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
gavin_mitchell Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes?
rachel_green If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
gavin_mitchell Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. Man, I really bug you, don't I?
rachel_green Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
monica_geller Hey Rach!
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Ready for your birthday lunch?
rachel_green Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
gavin_mitchell Pleased to meet you.
monica_geller Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
rachel_green Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
gavin_mitchell Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
rachel_green Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
monica_geller You were just being so nice to him!
rachel_green I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
rachel_green Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
monica_geller Right there! That was so fake!
rachel_green Shh!
rachel_green I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
monica_geller Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
rachel_green God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
monica_geller Does he?
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
rachel_green Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
molly She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
rachel_green Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
monica_geller Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
rachel_green Yeah, sure!
joey_tribbiani Oh.. Happy birth.. oh, see you later
monica_geller Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
rachel_green Oh, give me!
phoebe_buffay Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
mike_hannigan Yeah. We have rat babies now.
rachel_green Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
monica_geller So this is what a stroke feels like.
phoebe_buffay I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
rachel_green Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
phoebe_buffay No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
rachel_green whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
phoebe_buffay Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
dr_ross_geller Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
dr_ross_geller We have to stop them before something happens!
chandler_bing Right behind you, big guy!
joey_tribbiani So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
molly So where did you study?
joey_tribbiani Oh, I didn't go to college.
molly No, where did you study acting?
joey_tribbiani Molly.. people don't study acting..
dr_ross_geller Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
molly Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
dr_ross_geller Thanx.
joey_tribbiani Will the stable boy never get the princess??
dr_ross_geller What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
joey_tribbiani No.. the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller Come on! Joe!
joey_tribbiani Ok
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode12 Hi, is Molly here?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, come on in. Molly?
molly Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha I'll see you tomorrow.
dr_ross_geller Ok.. Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
joey_tribbiani It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
phoebe_buffay Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
mike_hannigan Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
phoebe_buffay Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
mike_hannigan Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
phoebe_buffay Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
mike_hannigan Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
phoebe_buffay No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like.. That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
mike_hannigan Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
mike_hannigan It's gonna be ok.
phoebe_buffay You must think I'm crazy.
mike_hannigan No, I think you're sweet.
phoebe_buffay Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to.. let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from.. when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
monica_geller No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
rachel_green Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
monica_geller Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up
rachel_green Mmm hmm.
gavin_mitchell Yeah, hey.
monica_geller Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
rachel_green No.
gavin_mitchell Nice party.
rachel_green Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at. 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame..
monica_geller Again, you're welcome.
gavin_mitchell Look, I'll just give you this and go.
rachel_green Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
gavin_mitchell Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I.. got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
rachel_green Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card "From Gavin"
gavin_mitchell I really mean it.
rachel_green Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
gavin_mitchell You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!
rachel_green See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
gavin_mitchell I'm not sure.
rachel_green Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
gavin_mitchell I do have feelings for you.
rachel_green You do?
gavin_mitchell Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
rachel_green See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you.. and you do that..
chandler_bing First I was afraid, I was petrified
phoebe_buffay Hey
chandler_bing Hi
phoebe_buffay Listen, I think I've left something here.
chandler_bing Oh, well someone left this This is yours?
phoebe_buffay No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
chandler_bing Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
monica_geller Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, maybe that's him!
