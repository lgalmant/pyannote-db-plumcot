monica I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
joey Eh! There you go.
monica You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
phoebe Oh, ew!
frank What?
phoebe Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
frank What, wait, you mean like this?
phoebe Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
frank Your not doing it.
phoebe Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....

ross Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
chandler Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.

ross And!! Isabella Rosselini.
chandler Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
rachel So?
chandler So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
rachel Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
phoebe Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.

frank Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
chandler Okay, on three. One....Two....
joey Why don't we just go on two.
chandler Why two?
joey Because it's faster.
chandler Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
rachel Oh!
joey All right, but in the future...
ross Okay!! Okay!!
rachel Come on!
ross Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
chandler Okay, one...two...
joey So we are going on two?

chandler Oh, good job Joe.
joey Wow, it's big!
chandler Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
joey Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
phoebe Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
joey Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
chandler Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
joey Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
rachel Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
ross Thank you.
isabella Um, coffee to go, please.
ross Isabella Rosselini.
monica Are you serious? Oh my God.
ross Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
monica Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
ross Yeah, maybe.
rachel Oh-oh, you lie.
ross What you don't think I'd go up to her?
rachel Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
ross Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
rachel You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
ross Okay, hold my crawler.
rachel Okay.
monica Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
rachel Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
ross Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
isabella Aren't you with that girl over there?
ross Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
isabella I'm sorry.
ross Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
isabella Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
ross Um, yeah.
isabella May I see it?
ross Um, no.
isabella Come on!
ross But, okay.
isabella I'm not on the list!
ross Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
isabella It's laminated!
ross Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
isabella Y'know it's ironic...
ross What?
isabella ..because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
ross We're just gonna be friends.
joey Y'know what?
chandler Umm?
joey I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
