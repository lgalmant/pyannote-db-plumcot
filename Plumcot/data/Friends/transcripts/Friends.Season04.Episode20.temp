monica He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
joey Oh, you should here me.

chandler They don't have those.
joey Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
monica Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over
joey Ohhh, yeah!
monica He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
chandler Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
joey I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.

rachel Hi!
chandler Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
joey Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
rachel Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
chandler What?
rachel Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
chandler Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.

ross Yeah!
rachel You mean, you mean 30 days?
ross Yeah.
rachel From now?
ross Yeah.
rachel Well, that's great.
ross Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
joey Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
joshua Hey, Rachel.
rachel Hi!
joshua What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.

joshua Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
rachel Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I - that I think we need - we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
joshua I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
rachel Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ... ... I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
joshua What?!
rachel Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
joshua Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."

phoebe Yeah, I think we are.
monica This isn't even my dress.

monica I'm changing out of this.
phoebe Me too.
monica In like a half-hour?
phoebe Me too.
monica Okay, throw it straight this time.
phoebe Okay.
monica I'm getting married next!!
phoebe Yay!
phoebe I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
monica Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
phoebe I guess.
phoebe Oh my God!
monica Oh God.
phoebe Oh, you're such a cheater!
chandler Hello! Little ones.
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey!
monica So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
chandler Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
phoebe Oh, how'd that happen?
chandler Because I'm cooler.
monica No, seriously.
chandler Well she's, she's the kinda girl - Joey was unconscious.
joey Hey you guys! What's happening?
monica Oh my God!
phoebe What is that?
joey Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
monica Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
joey I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
chandler Plus, you look cool.
rachel Well, I just called Joshua
phoebe Oh, how did it go?
rachel Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married - I'm just going through a hard time.
phoebe What did he say?
rachel Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
monica Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
rachel Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
phoebe Yeah, maybe.
rachel And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
phoebe Any luck?
rachel Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
monica Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
ross Hey!
monica Hey!
ross So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
rachel Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
ross Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
rachel Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
ross What happened?
rachel Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
ross Noo. Why?
rachel Well, apparently he scares easy.
ross Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
rachel It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
ross Come here.
rachel Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
ross Yeah.
rachel Yeah.
ross You okay?
rachel Yeah! I got my girls.
rachel Ugh.
phoebe Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
rachel What?
rachel Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
monica Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
monica Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
rachel Oh, okay!
monica No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
phoebe No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
rachel I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
phoebe Not after this!
rachel Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
joshua I gotta go.
rachel Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
joey Dude! I am trying to sleep!
