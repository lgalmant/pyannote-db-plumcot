chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
chandler_bing Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do..I mean come on!!
dr_ross_geller OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
chandler_bing No!
dr_ross_geller OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
chandler_bing Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
dr_ross_geller Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
chandler_bing So are you gonna...talk to her?
dr_ross_geller Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
chandler_bing You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
dr_ross_geller No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
chandler_bing No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
chandler_bing Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
dr_ross_geller Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
chandler_bing Why did I get married?!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
phoebe_buffay Well it depends.
joey_tribbiani On...?
phoebe_buffay On how far along he's in the sex change process!
monica_geller No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
joey_tribbiani Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
phoebe_buffay Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
joey_tribbiani Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
phoebe_buffay Wow! Talking about high maintenance
joey_tribbiani Hey hey! You dye your hair!
phoebe_buffay I'm a woman!
joey_tribbiani Arghhh! Double standards!
phoebe_buffay Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
monica_geller Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
phoebe_buffay But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
monica_geller It's just, I'm not good at singing.
phoebe_buffay Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
monica_geller No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
phoebe_buffay OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
monica_geller So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
phoebe_buffay While drinking...
monica_geller I'm there!
rachel_green Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
phoebe_buffay Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
rachel_green No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god.
monica_geller You kissed him?
rachel_green Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
monica_geller Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
phoebe_buffay It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
monica_geller Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
rachel_green You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
monica_geller I thought you hated him?
rachel_green You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
monica_geller So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
rachel_green I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
monica_geller Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross
rachel_green Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
phoebe_buffay Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
salon_girl#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode13 Hi
joey_tribbiani Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
salon_girl#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode13 Name?
joey_tribbiani Chandler Bing.
salon_girl#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode13 Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.
joey_tribbiani OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff
sonya I'll take care of it
joey_tribbiani Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
sonya Oh absolutely.
joey_tribbiani Oh good...
sonya Are you looking to meet somebody?
joey_tribbiani All right let's just do this.
sonya We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
joey_tribbiani Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
chandler_bing Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
dr_ross_geller Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
chandler_bing Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
dr_ross_geller That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
chandler_bing What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
chandler_bing Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
dr_ross_geller No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
chandler_bing Did she go out with him?
dr_ross_geller No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
chandler_bing Ah! The high road...
dr_ross_geller You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
chandler_bing Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
dr_ross_geller You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
chandler_bing I thought I had to make the jokes!
dr_ross_geller Don't you have to be at work?
chandler_bing Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
dr_ross_geller Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
blonde_girl#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode13 Sorry...we were just leaving
chandler_bing We still got it!
rachel_green Who is it?
gavin_mitchell Gavin! I brought you some soup.
rachel_green Why?
gavin_mitchell I heard you were sick...
rachel_green Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin
gavin_mitchell I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
rachel_green I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
gavin_mitchell Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
rachel_green Oh no no no
gavin_mitchell So I had fun last night
rachel_green So did I
gavin_mitchell Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
rachel_green It's just a cold
gavin_mitchell Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
rachel_green What? What's the matter?
gavin_mitchell What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
rachel_green Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
gavin_mitchell Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything
rachel_green Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
gavin_mitchell Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
rachel_green I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
molly Hi!
rachel_green Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
molly No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
rachel_green Right, right, yes!
molly Don't panic!
rachel_green What?
molly There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
rachel_green No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
gavin_mitchell Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
molly Hello! I just go and get Emma.
rachel_green OK.
gavin_mitchell So hum...Why did I have to hide?
rachel_green I thought it was Ross.
gavin_mitchell So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
rachel_green There isn't. There is totally isn't.
gavin_mitchell You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
rachel_green All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
gavin_mitchell It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
rachel_green Yes
gavin_mitchell I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
rachel_green People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
gavin_mitchell Don't be. It's just bad timing.
rachel_green So seriously...rodeo clown?
gavin_mitchell One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
phoebe_buffay "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
mike_hannigan Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kennethsinging "I touch myself"...I'm not here to judge!
phoebe_buffay Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
monica_geller No I told you I can't.
phoebe_buffay But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
monica_geller What have you heard me sing?
phoebe_buffay All the time when you're cooking.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
monica_geller Yeah I do rock that one.
phoebe_buffay OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
monica_geller Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
mike_hannigan Well I've got a book around...
monica_geller "Delta Dawn"
dr_ross_geller Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
the_woman You already hit on me an hour ago
dr_ross_geller Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
chandler_bing I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
dr_ross_geller This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
chandler_bing By drowning or...?!
michelle Why would he break up with me?
her_friend#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode13 I don't know sweetie.
michelle All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?
chandler_bing Well...
dr_ross_geller I know!
mike_hannigan All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging "Delta Dawn".
monica_geller Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
phoebe_buffay Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
monica_geller Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?.."
phoebe_buffay Can you totally see through her shirt ?
mike_hannigan Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
monica_geller "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
joey_tribbiani Hey, I need your help.
chandler_bing Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
joey_tribbiani Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
chandler_bing I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
joey_tribbiani You may be a sissy but I'll still All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
chandler_bing It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
joey_tribbiani All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.
chandler_bing Ok. First of all, this is green!
joey_tribbiani What the hell am I supposed to do!
chandler_bing All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
joey_tribbiani What, what.
chandler_bing Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
chandler_bing Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
joey_tribbiani Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!
chandler_bing Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
monica_geller "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
phoebe_buffay Every little bit of you!
monica_geller I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
mike_hannigan Sure.
phoebe_buffay Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...
monica_geller Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
mike_hannigan Also a good gift? Underwear.
michelle Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.
dr_ross_geller But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
michelle It's so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it's like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.
dr_ross_geller Uh-ah!
michelle No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
dr_ross_geller Good choice Ross.
rachel_green Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
rachel_green Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk somebody here?
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
rachel_green Who?
dr_ross_geller Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
rachel_green You've being seeing someone?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
michelle What are you taking amoxicillin for?
dr_ross_geller How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
rachel_green Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
michelle Ah, who is Emma?
dr_ross_geller I told you about my daughter.
michelle This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
chandler_bing And done!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon
chandler_bing Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
chandler_bing Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
joey_tribbiani Thank you so much.
chandler_bing No problem.
joey_tribbiani Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Comb my eyelashes.
monica_geller Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters I am so excited'. And make it bouncy!
phoebe_buffay Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
chandler_bing I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
monica_geller Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
chandler_bing Really? In front of all this people?
monica_geller And they love me!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Yes, she gives the people what they want.
monica_geller All right, watch!
monica_geller "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
chandler_bing Are those my wife's nipples?
phoebe_buffay Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
chandler_bing I gotta stop this.
monica_geller Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
chandler_bing You, touching yourself, out!
rachel_green Wow. She does that a lot!
michelle Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!
rachel_green What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
michelle Actually about an hour and a half.
dr_ross_geller I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
michelle You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding?
michelle Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
dr_ross_geller We'll see.
rachel_green Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
rachel_green How do you know about that?
dr_ross_geller Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
michelle Emma.
dr_ross_geller When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
rachel_green Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
michelle No, actually, see I had to pee, cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
dr_ross_geller Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
michelle Well, call me!
dr_ross_geller Ok.
michelle No, wait, you don't have my phone number!
dr_ross_geller You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
rachel_green Score.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
rachel_green Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
dr_ross_geller Oh, really!
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Oh, really!
rachel_green Oh yeah.
dr_ross_geller What about the guy from the bar?
rachel_green What? Who?
dr_ross_geller The guy you gave your number to.
rachel_green Whoa, how do you know about that?
dr_ross_geller Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.
rachel_green Why didn't I get that message?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
dr_ross_geller Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
rachel_green Ross?
dr_ross_geller I never gave it to you.
rachel_green Why?
dr_ross_geller I don't know.
rachel_green Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
dr_ross_geller Who am I?
rachel_green Yes.
dr_ross_geller I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
rachel_green Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
dr_ross_geller None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!
rachel_green Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, what, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I say no.You know what, it's not, because it works for us! But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
dr_ross_geller Uh, clearly.
rachel_green And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
joey_tribbiani Ha, oh, of course.
rachel_green Thank you.
joey_tribbiani Your eyebrows look weird.
chandler_bing Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine. So you just touch yourself for anything?
