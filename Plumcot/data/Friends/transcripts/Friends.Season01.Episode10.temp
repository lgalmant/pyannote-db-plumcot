ross Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
all Oooh!
monica W-wait. What is that?
ross 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
monica No, no, I don't.
rachel Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
ross My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
phoebe That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
chandler Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
monica Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
ross Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
monica Why don't you just get a roommate?
ross Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
phoebe So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
chandler Might wanna open with the snowman.
all Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
monica So, how'd it go?
joey Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
ross How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
joey I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
monica So what are you gonna be?
joey Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
rachel Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
chandler Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday
rachel Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
phoebe Yeah, you wish!
chandler It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
all Yeah, okay. Alright.
chandler Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
all Woooo! Yeah!
rachel Phoebe, you're on.
phoebe Oh, oh, good.
rachel Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
phoebe Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Sung
max No. No, that's- that's okay.
phoebe Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
chandler That guy's going home with a note!
david Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
phoebe Could you speak up please?
david Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
max Daryl Hannah.
david Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
max Hard quality.
david -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
phoebe Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
joey Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
ross Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
rachel Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
ross Just a smidge.
phoebe David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
monica I think it's romantic.
phoebe Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
rachel Yeah!
phoebe Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
chandler Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
phoebe No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
chandler Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
monica What?!
ross C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
chandler I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
monica Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
chandler I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
joey Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
chandler Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
joey Nice shoes, huh?
chandler Aah, y'killing me!
monica Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
ross Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
monica Do you always have to bring him here?
ross I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
chandler Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
ross Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
chandler Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
david ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
phoebe Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
david Yuh.
phoebe Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
david Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
phoebe Sure.
david Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
phoebe Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
david Rrrreally.
phoebe Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
david ...Now? Now?
phoebe Oh yeah, right now.
david Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
phoebe Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
david Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
phoebe I can hop.
ross So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
monica I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
chandler Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
monica Yeah.
joey You know more than one Fun Bobby?
chandler I happen to know a Fun Bob.
rachel Okay, here we go...
joey Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
rachel There. Now there is.
ross Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
joey Uh, four.
ross Four.
rachel Five.
ross Five.
rachel Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
joey Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
ross Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
rachel Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
ross Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
monica What's the matter?
ross Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
chandler That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
ross Really.
chandler Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
ross What, uh... what juggling thing?
chandler With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
ross No.
chandler Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
max Phoebe. Hi.
phoebe Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
max No. Have you seen David?
phoebe No, no, he hasn't been around.
max Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
phoebe Minsk?
max Minsk. It's in Russia.
phoebe I know where Minsk is.
max We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
phoebe So when, when do you leave?
max January first.
phoebe Hello?
david Hey!
phoebe Hi.
david Hi! What-what're you doing here?
phoebe Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
max It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
phoebe Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
max Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
david Thank you, Max. Thank you.
phoebe So-so you're really not going?
david I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
phoebe Oh don't do that.
david Please.
phoebe Oh no no.
david No, but I'm asking-
phoebe Oh, but I can't do that-
david No, but I can't-
phoebe It's your thing, and-
david -make the decision-
phoebe Okay, um, stay.
david Stay.
phoebe Stay.
phoebe Getting so good at that!
david It was Max's stuff.
janice I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
chandler You remember Janice.
monica Vividly.
monica Hi.
sandy Hi, I'm Sandy.
joey Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
sandy Yeah. That's okay, right?
ross Par-tay!
monica That thing is not coming in here.
ross 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
monica I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
ross Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
monica Alright. Just keep him away from me.
ross Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
monica Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
rachel Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
phoebe And then... your face is bloated?
rachel No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
sandy Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
joey Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
sandy Yeah.
joey Hey, kids...
ross Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
janice There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
chandler But you found me!
janice Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
chandler Kill me. Kill me now.
monica Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
fun_bobby Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
joey Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
fun_bobby It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
janice Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
chandler Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
janice Oh, no. Oh, no.
chandler I'm sorry you misunderstood...
janice Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
chandler Oh, will you give me the thing.
phoebe Hi, Max!
max Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
david Wow.
max It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
phoebe Are you alright?
david Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
phoebe You're going to Minsk.
david No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
phoebe Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
david Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
phoebe Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
david Uh, ow.
phoebe Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
david I'll never forget you.
phoebe And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
dick_clark Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
joey There y'go, kids.
chandler And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
joey You seen Sandy?
chandler Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
rachel Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
all What?
rachel The bll is drrbing!
dick_clark In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
chandler And the moment of joy is upon us.
joey Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
phoebe Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
monica Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
chandler Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
phoebe I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
rachel I can't kiss anyone.
monica So I'm kissing everyone?
joey Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
ross Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
chandler Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
joey Alrightalrightalright. There.
ross I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
rachel ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
