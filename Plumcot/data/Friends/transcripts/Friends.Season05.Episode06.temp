joey Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
monica What?!
joey Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
chandler Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
joey Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
chandler_and_monica Okay.
monica Sorry.
chandler Sorry.
joey I can hear that!
monica Rachel's at work.
joey I can still hear you!
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey!
chandler Hello!
monica Hey, what's that?
phoebe Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
phoebe Eeeee--ohh!! God!
joey Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
phoebe Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
chandler Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
ross Hey!
gunther Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
ross How come? Everybody else does.
gunther You can't.
monica What is that?
ross Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
monica This is all of your things.
ross Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
monica So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
ross Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
gunther I'll take it all.
joey Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
ross Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
chandler Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
ross After what I did? Can you blame her?
phoebe Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
joey What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
monica Now calm down Joey.
joey No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
phoebe Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
chandler Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
monica Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
joey No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
rachel Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
monica Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
rachel I want the little round waffles.
monica All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
rachel Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
rachel Arghhhh!!!!!!
monica Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
phoebe I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
joey I'll take it!
phoebe That might work!
joey Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
chandler You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
ross No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
joey What's the matter Ross?
ross Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
phoebe Why?
ross Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
joey That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
chandler So you're really okay with this?
ross Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
chandler Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
joey Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
rachel You guys! You guys!
monica We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
rachel It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
monica And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
rachel Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
joey Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
rachel Yeah!
joey Yeah, you fogged Danny.
rachel Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
joey Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
monica Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
danny Yeah?
rachel Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
monica We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
danny Okay.
rachel Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
danny Okay.
danny Yesss?
rachel Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
monica Yeah.
danny O-kay!
monica Wow! That guy is so rude!
rachel Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
monica Well you did a little bit.
rachel Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
monica I totally forgive you!
rachel Really?
monica Yes!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
monica Crematorium Chris? Sure!
phoebe He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
monica Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
rachel What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
phoebe This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
ross I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
chandler Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
ross No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
chandler So, rocks.
ross I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
joey Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
ross I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
joey Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
ross Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
joey You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
ross Why?
joey It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
ross What's going on?
joey We all hate Emily!
phoebe Nooo!!
monica No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
joey Yeah!
chandler Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
joey Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
ross Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
phoebe I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
monica God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
phoebe Oh, I know.
joey I kinda feel like it's my fault.
chandler Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
joey Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
chandler Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
phoebe All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
chandler Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
phoebe Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
rachel Hi!
danny So you like the short hair better.
rachel What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
danny I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
rachel Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
danny Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
rachel What?
danny That's cool. Cool.
rachel What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
danny Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
rachel So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
danny Do you?
rachel Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
danny Okay.
rachel And stop saying that! I hate that!
danny Okay!
rachel Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
danny The pizza-place across the street any good?
rachel What?!
danny I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
rachel Okay. Okay.
danny Stop saying that. I hate that.
chandler Uh, Ross?
phoebe Are you still mad at us?
ross Yep.
phoebe Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
ross Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
joey Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
chandler Yeah, we are so sorry.
phoebe You're kinda stepping on the song.
joey Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
monica Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
phoebe Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
ross Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
phoebe Yes! Exactly! And that's why
monica Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
ross Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
phoebe Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
joey Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
ross You do, huh?
joey Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone
ross What are you talking about?
joey I'm not sure.
rachel Hi!
monica Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
rachel Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
monica How did that happen?
rachel That yeti is one smooth talker.
monica I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
rachel Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
all No! Why?
rachel Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
ross Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
rachel Ross, I
joey RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
rachel Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
joey All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
ross Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
rachel I haven't seen him in so long!
phoebe Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
monica Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
joey It's almost as if he knew.
monica I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
ross Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
phoebe Hi Emily!
chandler Hi!
emily Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
joey Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
emily Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
ross Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
emily She's there?!
chandler Oh yeah, there-there she is!
ross Yeah, yeah, she's here.
emily Ross, take me off speakerphone.
ross Hi.
emily How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
ross Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
emily You obviously can't keep away from her.
ross Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
emily I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
ross Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
emily You're right.
ross So, can you trust me?
emily No.
joey I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
monica How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
joey You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
ross Well, I guess that's it.
all Why, what happened?
joey What happened? What happened?
ross My marriage is over.
all What?!
monica Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
phoebe Here.
rachel Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
ross Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
phoebe Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
