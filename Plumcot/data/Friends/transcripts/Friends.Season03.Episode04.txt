host#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode04 Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
phoebe_buffay Oh, oh! It's on again!
joey_tribbiani You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
all@ Shhhh!
host#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode04 Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
mike#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode04 And there is Kevin.
joey_tribbiani Can we please turn this off?
rachel_green Noo way, Kevin.
mike#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode04 There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
dr_ross_geller Are you intrigued?
chandler_bing You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
mike#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode04 Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
joey_tribbiani Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
chandler_bing Well, it's official there are no good movies.
janice Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
monica_geller Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
chandler_bing Hey, man. What's up?
joey_tribbiani Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
chandler_bing Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
phoebe_buffay Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
joey_tribbiani How is it you?
phoebe_buffay Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
joey_tribbiani Yep, that's my audition.
monica_geller See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
phoebe_buffay Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
janice What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
joey_tribbiani Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
phoebe_buffay That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
phoebe_buffay What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh
joey_tribbiani What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
joey_tribbiani Hang up, hang up.
phoebe_buffay 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
chandler_bing Is anybody else scared?
phoebe_buffay 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
chandler_bing Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
monica_geller Oh, now you want a pad.
carol_willick@susan_bunch Hey!!
dr_ross_geller There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
carol_willick He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
susan_bunch He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
susan_bunch So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
carol_willick This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
dr_ross_geller You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
dr_ross_geller Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
rachel_green Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
monica_geller I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
joey_tribbiani I love that movie.
monica_geller There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
chandler_bing Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
chandler_bing Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
rachel_green What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
chandler_bing Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
dr_ross_geller And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
chandler_bing Noo.
dr_ross_geller You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
chandler_bing No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
rachel_green Men are unbelievable.
monica_geller What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
chandler_bing I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
monica_geller Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
joey_tribbiani Hey, you know about that?!
chandler_bing Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
dr_ross_geller Where there is no fear of commitment.
chandler_bing Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
joey_tribbiani Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
rachel_green Amazingly, that makes sense.
chandler_bing You think?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
chandler_bing Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
rachel_green Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
joey_tribbiani Come on baby, come on!
phoebe_buffay 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
rachel_green Very nice touch.
phoebe_buffay 'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
rachel_green Unbelievable.
joey_tribbiani Thank you so much.
phoebe_buffay It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
joey_tribbiani You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
joey_tribbiani Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
phoebe_buffay Two?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
joey_tribbiani Nooo, four.
janice So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
chandler_bing 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
janice Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
chandler_bing Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
janice Oh, you didn't have to do this.
chandler_bing Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
janice Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
chandler_bing Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
janice We should?
chandler_bing Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
janice I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
chandler_bing I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
janice You probably want us to move in together?
chandler_bing It doesn't scare me!
janice Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
chandler_bing Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
rachel_green Honey, this will help.
chandler_bing So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
monica_geller@rachel_green Uff.
monica_geller That is never good.
chandler_bing Then I got all needy and clingy.
rachel_green Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
chandler_bing She said she'd call me.
monica_geller@rachel_green Ohh!
chandler_bing Oh God.
monica_geller Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
chandler_bing This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
rachel_green Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
monica_geller You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
rachel_green Yeah, you do.
chandler_bing So, you don't think I'm terminal?
monica_geller Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
chandler_bing Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
monica_geller@rachel_green Nooo!
rachel_green This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
monica_geller She has to know that your not ready.
rachel_green Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
chandler_bing So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
rachel_green Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
chandler_bing I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
rachel_green G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
joey_tribbiani G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
dr_ross_geller Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Go Joe!!!
phoebe_buffay Helloo! Oh!
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! There you are!
phoebe_buffay No it's not, sorry.
joey_tribbiani But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
joey_tribbiani Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
phoebe_buffay Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
joey_tribbiani It's okay, these things happen.
phoebe_buffay But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
joey_tribbiani I'm, I'm okay. See.
phoebe_buffay Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
joey_tribbiani No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
phoebe_buffay Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
joey_tribbiani They actually said that?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
phoebe_buffay Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
dr_ross_geller You'll never get me, Joe!!!
janice No, thank you. Chandler!
chandler_bing Hello, Janice.
janice What are you doing here?
chandler_bing Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
janice Are you being British?!
chandler_bing No. Not anymore.
janice Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
chandler_bing Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
janice Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
chandler_bing Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
janice Where is this party?
chandler_bing Here in Chelsea.
janice Who's party is it?
chandler_bing A woman's
janice What woman?!
chandler_bing Chelsea.
janice Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
chandler_bing Can I be that guy?
phoebe_buffay Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
joey_tribbiani Okay, shoot.
phoebe_buffay Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
joey_tribbiani I didn't get it?
phoebe_buffay No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
joey_tribbiani Okay, what else?
phoebe_buffay Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
joey_tribbiani Oh.
phoebe_buffay Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
joey_tribbiani Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, no, I understand.
joey_tribbiani You do, thanks.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Sorry.
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute.
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
joey_tribbiani That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
chandler_bing ...And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
monica_geller My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
chandler_bing I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
rachel_green Yeah, it is.
monica_geller You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
chandler_bing Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
rachel_green Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
monica_geller If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing Hello!
monica_geller Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
rachel_green Yes, and grumpy.
chandler_bing What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
rachel_green He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
chandler_bing I love you too.
monica_geller Aw, it's soo unfair.
carol_willick G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
dr_ross_geller Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
susan_bunch What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
dr_ross_geller Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
monica_geller What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
dr_ross_geller What are you talking about?
monica_geller The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
dr_ross_geller Okay, you are totally making this up.
monica_geller How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
dr_ross_geller Oh God.
susan_bunch I've literally never been this happy.
monica_geller Wasn't there a little song?
carol_willick Oh please God, let there be a song.
dr_ross_geller There was no song. There was no song!
monica_geller 'I am Bea.'
dr_ross_geller Okay.
monica_geller 'I drink tea.'
dr_ross_geller Okay, that's, that's enough.
monica_geller '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
dr_ross_geller Won't you dance around with me.
monica_geller A-ha!!!
young_ross 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
young_monica Ross!!!
