phoebe What am I sitting on?
chandler Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
phoebe Ew-eww!! Undies!
rachel All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
ross Well, they're not mine!
chandler Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
joey Yeah, they're mine.
chandler See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
ross Why are they here?
joey I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
rachel Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
chandler Yeah!
monica Yeah!
rachel Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
joey Chandler? A word.
joey That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
monica Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
joey Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
monica Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
joey Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't
chandler All this lying has been hard on us too.
joey Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
chandler Well, yeah actually.
monica We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
chandler I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
monica We are! Help us!
chandler Help!
joey All right! But, you do it with me once.
monica Joey!
joey Didn't think so.
monica Hey, Phoebe!
chandler Hi, Pheebs!
rachel Hey, Pheebs!
joey Hey, Pheebs!
rachel What are you reading?
phoebe Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
chandler I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
phoebe Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
rachel Honey that sounds like fun.
phoebe Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
rachel Okay.
phoebe Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
rachel Oh, I read that in high school.
phoebe This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
ross Hi.
joey What's wrong buddy?
ross Someone at work ate my sandwich!
chandler Well, what did the police say?
ross My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
chandler Ross, it's just a sandwich!
ross Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
monica Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
ross That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
chandler Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
joey I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
phoebe Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
ross Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
chandler Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
phoebe Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
all Whoa! Ohh!!
monica Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
phoebe Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
monica Phoebe?
phoebe Well, he stabbed me first!!
rachel Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
phoebe Okay.
rachel So Pheebs, what is the book about?
phoebe I thought you said you read it in high school.
rachel Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
phoebe Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
the_teacher How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
rachel Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
the_teacher Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
rachel Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
the_teacher Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
phoebe You completely stole my answer!
rachel Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
phoebe Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
the_teacher What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
phoebe I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
the_teacher Would ya care to venture one?
phoebe Would you care to venture one?
the_teacher Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
phoebe Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
the_teacher All right, let's move on.
phoebe Okay then.
phoebe Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
rachel Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
ross Phoebe!
phoebe Yeah?
ross Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
monica Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
ross That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
cynthia God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
joey So you uh, still wondering?
cynthia No, we just went out.
joey You're smart. I like that.
cynthia Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
joey Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
cynthia I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
joey Hiya.
rachel Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna
chandler What is going on here?
rachel And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
joey I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
joey You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
monica We're so sorry.
chandler Yeah.
joey Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
chandler No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
joey Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
chandler Oh-I don't know.
joey Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
monica Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
joey All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
dr_leedbetter Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
ross Yeah, of course, Donald.
dr_leedbetter We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
ross What?!
dr_leedbetter Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
ross Yeah.
dr_leedbetter We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
ross Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
dr_leedbetter A sandwich?
ross Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
dr_leedbetter Oh, you know what?
ross What?
dr_leedbetter I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
ross You ate my sandwich?
dr_leedbetter It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
ross Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
dr_leedbetter No.
ross Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
dr_leedbetter There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
ross That said it was my sandwich?!
dr_leedbetter Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
ross What?
dr_leedbetter Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
ross You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
ross MY SANDWICH?!!!
ross MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
rachel Hi!
phoebe Hi!
rachel So umm, what's this book about?
phoebe You didn't read this one either?!
rachel Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
phoebe What?
rachel Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
phoebe No! You should've read it yourself!
rachel Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
phoebe Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
rachel A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
phoebe Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
the_teacher Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
phoebe Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
the_teacher Well, go ahead Rachel.
rachel Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
the_teacher If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
rachel Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
chandler Hey.
monica Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
chandler You're naked in this picture!
monica I know.
chandler Ross?
ross Hey Chandler. Monica!
monica Ross, are you okay?
ross I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
monica Why?!
ross On account of my rage.
chandler Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
ross He gave me a pill for it.
monica A pill?
ross Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
monica Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
chandler And you're okay with that?
ross I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
rachel Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
phoebe I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
rachel That was not funny!
phoebe Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
rachel Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
phoebe Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
rachel Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
monica I know! I know! I know!
the_teacher Monica, you asked the question.
rachel Oh my God! That's Monica!!
joey Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
rachel You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
ross What's going on?
rachel Joey has got a secret peephole!
chandler Oh no! No! No! No!
rachel Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
rachel Look!
ross Dude! That's my sister!
monica Give me that!
phoebe All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
joey No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda
chandler All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
joey Thank you!
chandler Joey's a sex addict.
joey What?!! No I'm not!!
monica It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
joey No! No! I am not a sex addict!
monica Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
joey No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
rachel Well, what is the truth?
ross Yeah, what's going on?
phoebe What's going on?
joey I slept with Monica.
chandler Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
monica Oh no!
ross You slept with my sister?
joey Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
ross This is not good for my rage.
rachel Monica, is this true?
joey Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
monica Yes it's true.
rachel Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
joey Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
monica I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
ross My God Monica!!
chandler Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
joey No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
phoebe So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
joey That makes sense!
rachel And the video camera?
joey Uhh, Monica?
monica I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
joey But sadly I could not be enticed.
ross Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
monica I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
joey Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
phoebe I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
a_female_student Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
phoebe I don't know! I didn't come with her!
monica All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
all A test?!!
monica Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
