monica_geller I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
chandler_bing Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
monica_geller That was a half an hour?
chandler_bing It's your timer.
monica_geller Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
chandler_bing All right, then massage me up right nice!
chandler_bing Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
monica_geller It's so good, isn't it?
chandler_bing It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
monica_geller Say good-bye to sore muscles!
chandler_bing Good-bye muscles!!
chandler_bing I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
joey_tribbiani Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
chandler_bing Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
dr_ross_geller Sorry.
chandler_bing And the bunny got away.
dr_ross_geller This would be the place where you explain the hat.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
chandler_bing And you're gonna make them all disappear.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
chandler_bing Done.
rachel_green Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
joey_tribbiani Great! Thanks, Rach!
rachel_green Sure! God, please take those off!
joey_tribbiani All right.
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
chandler_bing Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Is everything okay?
joey_tribbiani Are you all right?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! Sorry!
phoebe_buffay It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
rachel_green Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
monica_geller Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
dr_ross_geller Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
monica_geller Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
phoebe_buffay It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
monica_geller Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
phoebe_buffay Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
phoebe_buffay It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
rachel_green Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
joey_tribbiani All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
rachel_green Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
joey_tribbiani Really? A purse?
rachel_green It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
joey_tribbiani It looks like a women's purse.
rachel_green No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
joey_tribbiani See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
rachel_green Exactly! Unisex!
joey_tribbiani Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
rachel_green No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
joey_tribbiani Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.

joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
phoebe_buffay Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
joey_tribbiani Here, I brought you some flowers.
phoebe_buffay Thanks!
chandler_bing Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
man#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode13 Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, welcome.
man#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode13 Hello. Hello.

phoebe_buffay That was my dad!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
monica_geller Oh, did you catch him?!
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller Wh-what did he say?!
phoebe_buffay He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
rachel_green Why?! Why not?!
phoebe_buffay Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
joey_tribbiani What did you say to him?
phoebe_buffay Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
the_pastor#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode13 Could everyone please take their seats?
phoebe_buffay All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller All right, let's go say good-bye.
joey_tribbiani Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
rachel_green Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
chandler_bing And a date with a man!
joey_tribbiani Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
phoebe_buffay All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
rachel_green Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
phoebe_buffay Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
dr_ross_geller Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
monica_geller Well, at least you scared someone.
phoebe_buffay Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
monica_geller Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
phoebe_buffay All right.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
monica_geller What are you talking about?
phoebe_buffay As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
monica_geller I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
phoebe_buffay He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
monica_geller No he's not!
chandler_bing Yes, he is!
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
monica_geller You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
dr_ross_geller Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
monica_geller But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
the_casting_director Any time you're ready, Joey.
joey_tribbiani Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
the_casting_director I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
the_casting_director Sure. What?
joey_tribbiani Well, first it's not a purse.
the_casting_director Okay, anytime.
joey_tribbiani I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
the_casting_director Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
joey_tribbiani All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
the_casting_director Umm, do you sell these bags?
joey_tribbiani Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
the_casting_director Okay! Thank you! That was great!
joey_tribbiani Yeah but I didn't read anything.
the_casting_director I think we've seen enough!
joey_tribbiani Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
chandler_bing Hey, is Rachel here?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
monica_geller Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
chandler_bing I don't like your massages.
monica_geller See? It's no big deal.
chandler_bing Okay, but now see you're crying!
monica_geller I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
chandler_bing It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
monica_geller Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
chandler_bing Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
monica_geller I'm crying here!!
chandler_bing Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
monica_geller Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
chandler_bing Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
monica_geller So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
chandler_bing Absolutely!
monica_geller Okay. I suck!
chandler_bing Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
frank_buffay_sr Thank you. All right.
phoebe_buffay Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
frank_buffay_sr Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
frank_buffay_sr So, what did Francis leave me?
phoebe_buffay Huh?
frank_buffay_sr Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
phoebe_buffay Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
frank_buffay_sr Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
phoebe_buffay Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
frank_buffay_sr Yes, yes I was.
phoebe_buffay Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
frank_buffay_sr It really says that?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah. See?
frank_buffay_sr Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
phoebe_buffay Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
frank_buffay_sr Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
phoebe_buffay What?!
frank_buffay_sr Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
phoebe_buffay But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
frank_buffay_sr Yeah, yeah. Why?
phoebe_buffay Lilly's dead.
frank_buffay_sr She what?!
phoebe_buffay She's dead.
frank_buffay_sr Are you sure?
phoebe_buffay Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
frank_buffay_sr I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
phoebe_buffay 17 years ago.
frank_buffay_sr Oh! What about, what about the girls?
phoebe_buffay Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
phoebe_buffay Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
frank_buffay_sr Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
phoebe_buffay Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
frank_buffay_sr So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
phoebe_buffay Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
frank_buffay_sr All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
phoebe_buffay That's a defense?
frank_buffay_sr Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
phoebe_buffay You make up songs?
frank_buffay_sr Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
frank_buffay_sr I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm
phoebe_buffay Well, I am.
phoebe_buffay Not yet, no.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
all@ Hey!
chandler_bing Hey man, how did the audition go?
joey_tribbiani Estelle said I didn't get it.
rachel_green What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
dr_ross_geller What kind of problem?
joey_tribbiani Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller Nooooo!
joey_tribbiani Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
monica_geller Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
joey_tribbiani I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
rachel_green Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
chandler_bing Oh, hey!
rachel_green ...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe I'm hearing this!
rachel_green Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
chandler_bing Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
