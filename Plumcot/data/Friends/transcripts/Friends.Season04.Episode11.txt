phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
frank_buffay_jr Oh I know!!
phoebe_buffay You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
frank_buffay_jr 'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch
phoebe_buffay Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
frank_buffay_jr We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
phoebe_buffay Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
frank_buffay_jr Uhh, yeah.
alice_knight_buffay We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
frank_buffay_jr See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
alice_knight_buffay And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
phoebe_buffay That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
joey_tribbiani Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
chandler_bing I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
rachel_green But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
chandler_bing Well, you-you know what I meant.
monica_geller No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
chandler_bing So what job did you get Joe?
joey_tribbiani Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
rachel_green Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
joey_tribbiani No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
chandler_bing@monica_geller@rachel_green Great!! That's great!
dr_ross_geller Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
joey_tribbiani Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
phoebe_buffay Hey!!
all@ Hey!
phoebe_buffay Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
all@ Oh my God!!
phoebe_buffay And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
dr_ross_geller My God!
monica_geller Are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Yeah
joey_tribbiani You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
phoebe_buffay Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
joey_tribbiani Huh.
monica_geller What did you tell them?
phoebe_buffay Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
chandler_bing You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
rachel_green Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
monica_geller Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
phoebe_buffay I know!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, what's your point?
dr_ross_geller Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
rachel_green Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
phoebe_buffay Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
joey_tribbiani No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
all@ Yeah.
monica_geller We just want you to think it through.
rachel_green Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
phoebe_buffay My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
kathy Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
chandler_bing Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
kathy Oh!
monica_geller I am so jealous.
rachel_green You guys are really right...there aren't you?
chandler_bing Yes. Right where?
monica_geller In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and
chandler_bing Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
monica_geller And the sex?
chandler_bing All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
rachel_green Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
dr_ross_geller That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
rachel_green Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
chandler_bing No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
monica_geller Then what is it?
chandler_bing Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
dr_ross_geller And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
chandler_bing No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
chandler_bing Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
monica_geller So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
chandler_bing We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
monica_geller Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
chandler_bing Yeah?
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Just go for it Chandler.
monica_geller Yeah, you should.
rachel_green Yeah, you should, really.
monica_geller Go on.
chandler_bing All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
joey_tribbiani Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
the_smart_kid Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
joey_tribbiani Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
phoebe_abbott_sr It's open! Come in!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
phoebe_abbott_sr Hi!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm late.
phoebe_abbott_sr Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
phoebe_buffay Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
phoebe_abbott_sr No, I was working on my pottery.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, erotiery!
phoebe_abbott_sr Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know
phoebe_buffay Okay.
phoebe_abbott_sr I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Why not?
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
phoebe_buffay Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
phoebe_abbott_sr No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I get a puppy!!
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
phoebe_buffay Why?
phoebe_abbott_sr I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
phoebe_abbott_sr I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
phoebe_buffay All right, I'm sorry.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
rhonda_the_tour_guide You mean Dr. Geller?
joey_tribbiani Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
rhonda_the_tour_guide Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
joey_tribbiani Well, how-how come?
rhonda_the_tour_guide That's just the way it is.
joey_tribbiani That's crazy.
rhonda_the_tour_guide Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
joey_tribbiani I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
dr_ross_geller That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
rhonda_the_tour_guide Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
dr_ross_geller Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
joey_tribbiani It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
dr_ross_geller But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
joey_tribbiani Whatever.
dr_ross_geller It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
monica_geller I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
joey_tribbiani Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
rachel_green Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
chandler_bing Hi.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
monica_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
monica_geller So, did you do it?
chandler_bing Yes, yes, we had the sex.
monica_geller Uh-oh, it was bad?
chandler_bing It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
monica_geller Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
rachel_green Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
chandler_bing Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
monica_geller All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now
chandler_bing Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
monica_geller Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
chandler_bing There are seven?!
rachel_green Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
chandler_bing That's one?
monica_geller It's kind of an important one!
chandler_bing Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
rachel_green Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
monica_geller Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
chandler_bing That-that's bad?
rachel_green Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
chandler_bing Well you might if it were anything like 7!
monica_geller All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
rachel_green Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
monica_geller All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7,..7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
the_older_scientist Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
dr_ross_geller Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
joey_tribbiani I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
joey_tribbiani I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
another_tour_guide I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
dr_ross_geller All right, there you go!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
the_older_scientist I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
dr_ross_geller Okay, good-good for you.
rhonda_the_tour_guide I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
dr_ross_geller Wow, Rhonda.
another_scientist I'm Scott.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, okay, Scott!
another_scientist And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
phoebe_buffay My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
rachel_green Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
monica_geller Y'know, I never saw that.
rachel_green Ooh, it was only okay.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
alice_knight_buffay Hi!
frank_buffay_jr Hi!
alice_knight_buffay Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
alice_knight_buffay None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
frank_buffay_jr Oh, who's this little guy?!
phoebe_buffay Oh! Ooh! Umm!
frank_buffay_jr Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
alice_knight_buffay You are so precious, I could just take you home.
phoebe_buffay Hey, why don't you?
frank_buffay_jr Are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, yeah!
frank_buffay_jr Oh, thanks.
monica_geller What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
alice_knight_buffay Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
frank_buffay_jr Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
monica_geller It's gonna be so great.
phoebe_abbott_sr Hi! What's going on?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
phoebe_abbott_sr But Phoebe
phoebe_buffay No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
phoebe_abbott_sr Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
monica_geller Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
rachel_green It depends on who asked.
monica_geller What if I asked?
rachel_green Oh, Mon, sure.
monica_geller Really?
rachel_green Yes. You're not asking are you?
monica_geller No.
rachel_green Yes! Totally!
kathy Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
