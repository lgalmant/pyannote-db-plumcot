chandler_bing Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
monica_geller Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
joey_tribbiani Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
all@ Hey!
dr_ross_geller Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
monica_geller Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
dr_ross_geller We were all pretty shaken up about it.
phoebe_buffay Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
dr_ross_geller Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
monica_geller Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
dr_ross_geller You get the dollhouse.
monica_geller I get the dollhouse!
phoebe_buffay Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
joey_tribbiani Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
phoebe_buffay No, just a barrel.
monica_geller Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
phoebe_buffay Really?! Really?!
monica_geller Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
chandler_bing My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
rachel_green Hey, Sophie!
sophie Hey, Rach!
chandler_bing Hey.
sophie Hey.
rachel_green Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
chandler_bing Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
rachel_green Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
chandler_bing Yes, I realise that.
rachel_green Summer catalogue!
chandler_bing That's the stuff!
joanna Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
rachel_green Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
joanna Bing! That's a great name.
chandler_bing Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
joanna Me too.
rachel_green Bye, Chandler.
joanna So ah, what's wrong with him?
rachel_green Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
joanna Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
rachel_green No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
joanna Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
rachel_green Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
joanna Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
sophie Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
joanna I know that.
monica_geller Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing Hello.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
monica_geller I know!!!
phoebe_buffay So, I'm here, ready to play.
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
monica_geller What's this?
phoebe_buffay That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
monica_geller Not one that can pee on the roof.
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
chandler_bing And is this in case the house sneezes?
phoebe_buffay No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
monica_geller I don't want a ghost.
phoebe_buffay Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
phoebe_buffay Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
rachel_green Hey!
all@ Hello.
rachel_green I need to talk to you!
dr_ross_geller Sure, what's up?
rachel_green Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
dr_ross_geller I-I know. Well if something comes up...
chandler_bing Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
rachel_green Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
chandler_bing Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
rachel_green That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
chandler_bing Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
rachel_green Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
phoebe_buffay Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
monica_geller Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
phoebe_buffay Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
dr_ross_geller Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
phoebe_buffay The little ones do.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Kate!
kate_miller Morning.
joey_tribbiani Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
the_director Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
joey_tribbiani And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode20 Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
lauren I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
joey_tribbiani What?!
lauren I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
joey_tribbiani Get out of here, really?!
lauren Absolutely!
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
lauren Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
joey_tribbiani They gave me the shaft all right.
lauren Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
joey_tribbiani Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
lauren Cool! I-I'll see you then.
joey_tribbiani All right.
the_director All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
all@ Hey!
phoebe_buffay Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
rachel_green Wow!!
phoebe_buffay Look, look!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what's this?!
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
monica_geller It's very interesting, Phoebe.
rachel_green What's this?
phoebe_buffay The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
dr_ross_geller This is the coolest house ever!!
phoebe_buffay Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
rachel_green All right!
dr_ross_geller I would!
monica_geller Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay Watch, watch.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Ooohhhh!!
phoebe_buffay And, and!
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Ahhhh!!
chandler_bing Hey, my Father's house does that!
rachel_green O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
chandler_bing Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
rachel_green Hmm.
chandler_bing Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
joanna Chandler is fantastic!!
rachel_green What?!
joanna Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
rachel_green Oh, I....
joanna Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
rachel_green Oh, I know...
joanna Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
sophie Isn't this great?!
joanna Don't spoil it.
joey_tribbiani Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
the_director Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
joey_tribbiani That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
kate_miller He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
kate_miller I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
joey_tribbiani Do you want me to want you to care?
kate_miller Do you?
joey_tribbiani What?
the_director Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
joey_tribbiani Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
kate_miller I've got no reason to stay.
the_director Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
kate_miller I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's gonna be all right.
lauren Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
joey_tribbiani What?
lauren You know! At the place I told you about last night?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
lauren Oh, okay.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
lauren I'll see you tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
lauren G'night.
joey_tribbiani Ah, are you okay?
kate_miller Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
kate_miller Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
joey_tribbiani How do you mean?
kate_miller Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
joey_tribbiani Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
kate_miller Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
kate_miller And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
joey_tribbiani And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
kate_miller And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
joey_tribbiani Something like that?
kate_miller Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller It's a little early to be drinkin'.
joey_tribbiani No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
dr_ross_geller Ohhhhh!
monica_geller You're kidding?! That's great!
joey_tribbiani Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
monica_geller Oh my.
joey_tribbiani Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
chandler_bing I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
rachel_green Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
chandler_bing That's what you say at the end of a date.
rachel_green You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
chandler_bing To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
monica_geller Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
rachel_green Well, they always called.
monica_geller Hmm, bite me.
joanna Did he call?
rachel_green No. Sorry.
joanna Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
sophie Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
joanna Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
rachel_green Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
joanna Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
rachel_green Well...
joanna The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
rachel_green No. I...
joanna Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
rachel_green Call her! Call her now!
chandler_bing Multiple, so many paper cuts.
rachel_green Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
chandler_bing Oh, well give me the phone then.
rachel_green Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
chandler_bing Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
rachel_green Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
chandler_bing Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
rachel_green I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
chandler_bing All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
rachel_green That's fine!
chandler_bing That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
rachel_green I know.
dr_ross_geller Mon?
monica_geller I'm in the shower!
dr_ross_geller Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
kate_miller Hi.
joey_tribbiani So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
kate_miller About what?
joey_tribbiani Y'know, about what happened with us.
kate_miller Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
joey_tribbiani What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
kate_miller Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
joey_tribbiani Nooo.
lauren Hi, Kate!
kate_miller Hi, Lauren.
joey_tribbiani Hi, Lauren.
lauren Hi, pig!
dr_ross_geller Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
monica_geller Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
phoebe_buffay What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
dr_ross_geller Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
phoebe_buffay All right. Did everyone get out okay?
monica_geller Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
phoebe_buffay Ohh. What is this?
dr_ross_geller No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
phoebe_buffay Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
chandler_bing It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
joanna Well, thanks again for lunch.
chandler_bing Yes, this, this was pleasant.
joanna It was, wasn't it?
chandler_bing The food there was, was great.
joanna Wasn't it?
chandler_bing So take care.
joanna You too.
chandler_bing Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
joanna Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
rachel_green Sophie's desk.
rachel_green Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
chandler_bing Noo!
rachel_green Chandler!!
chandler_bing Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
rachel_green Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
chandler_bing Ahhhh - I'm not going to call you.
joanna What?
chandler_bing I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
joanna Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
chandler_bing Yeah, o-okay.
joanna So...
chandler_bing Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
joey_tribbiani Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
