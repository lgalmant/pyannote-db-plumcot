rachel Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
terry An advance?
rachel It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
terry Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
rachel Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
rachel Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
guy Huh?
rachel Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
monica Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
ross No, they're not.
monica Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
ross You're wrong.
monica I am not wrong.
ross You're wrong.
monica No, I just talked to them.
ross I'm calling Mom.
joey Hey, hey.
chandler Hey.
phoebe Hey.
chandler And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
joey Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
chandler That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
phoebe What were you modeling for?
joey You know those posters for the city free clinic?
monica Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
phoebe You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
chandler Do you know which one you're gonna be?
joey No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
chandler Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
joey Thanks.
ross Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
monica Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
ross Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
monica You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
joey Yeah.
monica And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
chandler Yes, every single one of them.
monica Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
phoebe Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
monica So you're free Thursday, then.
phoebe Yeah. Oh, can I come?
monica Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
rachel Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
chandler I thought it was $98.50.
rachel Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
ross Well, I'm off to Carol's.
phoebe Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
ross Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
ross Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
susan No, she's at a faculty meeting.
ross Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
ross Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
susan What's it look like?
ross Kinda like a big face without skin.
susan Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
ross Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
susan Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
ross Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
susan Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
ross The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
susan What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
ross You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
susan Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
ross Do you uh, do you talk about me?
susan Yeah, yeah, all the time.
ross Really?
susan But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
ross Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
phoebe Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
chandler I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
monica Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
rachel No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
monica Rach, here's your mail.
rachel Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
monica No, here's your mail.
rachel Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
monica Would you just open it?
rachel Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
monica We all chipped in.
joey We did?
monica You owe me 20 bucks.
rachel Thank you. Thank you so much!
monica Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
rachel Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
chandler All right, I'm nine years old.
ross Oh, I hate this story.
chandler We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
rachel Oh my god.
chandler Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
joey Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
girl We did?
joey Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
girl Yeah, right.
joey I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
girl Get out.
joey I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
girl Really? You don't know what that means to me.
joey Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
girl Nothing.
joey Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
girl Yeah. Oh.
joey What's wrong?
girl I just remembered, I have to do something.
joey Oh. What?
girl Um, leave.
joey Wait, wait, wait!
joey So I guess you all saw it.
rachel Saw what?
phoebe No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
joey Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
chandler Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
monica Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
ross I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
monica All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
ross That's closer.
rachel I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
chandler Oh, you must stop shooping.
rachel Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
joey Chandler, will you just come in already?
chandler No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
phoebe Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
chandler Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
joey Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
monica That's not a question.
joey But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
monica All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
ross Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
monica Ah!
ross Ok, Mom never hit.
phoebe Ok, all done.
monica What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
phoebe Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
monica Why would we do that?
phoebe Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
monica Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
rachel Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
chandler The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
joey The balloon?
chandler No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
rachel I can't, I gotta go.
chandler Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
phoebe Almost never.
monica Got the keys? or Got the keys!
rachel Ok.
carol Anytime you're ready.
ross Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
carol Just aim for the bump.
ross Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
carol So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
ross Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
rachel I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
phoebe Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
monica Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
rachel We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
monica No I don't.
rachel Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
monica No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
rachel No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
chandler Do either of you have the keys?
monica The oven is on.
rachel Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
joey Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
monica Well then get it, get it!
joey That tone will not make me go any faster.
monica Joey!
joey That one will.
ross And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
carol Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
ross Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
susan Hi, how's it goin?
ross Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
carol I did.
ross Does it always, uh--?
carol No, no that was the first.
susan Keep singing! Keep singing!
ross Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
susan I felt it!
ross Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
joey Nope, not that one.
monica Can you go any faster with that?
joey Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
monica Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
chandler For an emergency just like this.
rachel All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
monica I swear you said you had the keys.
rachel No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
phoebe Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
monica Why would I have the keys?
rachel Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
monica But I didn't.
rachel Well, you should have.
monica Why?
rachel Because!
monica Why?
rachel Because!
monica Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
chandler Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
monica Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
ross Here we come, walkin' down the-this doesn't smell like Mom's.
monica No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
rachel Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
joey Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
monica Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
joey You call that delicious?
monica Stop it, stop it, stop it!
chandler Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
phoebe Ooh.
rachel What?
phoebe Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
joey I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
monica Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
phoebe It's nice that he has someone.
chandler Shall I carve?
rachel By all means.
chandler Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
ross I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
monica Does anybody wanna split this with me?
joey Oh, I will.
phoebe Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
monica Make a wish?
phoebe Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
joey The bigger half.
chandler I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
all That's so sweet.
ross And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
rachel And a crappy New Year.
chandler Here, here!
