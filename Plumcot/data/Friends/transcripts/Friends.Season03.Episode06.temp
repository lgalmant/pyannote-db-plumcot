janice Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
phoebe Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
ross I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
janice Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
joey Well, that's really a different question.
janice I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
joey Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
monica_and_rachel What?!!
rachel Excuse me, there was no time!
joey Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
janice Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
rachel Does anybody need more coffee?
ross Yeah, I'll take some.
joey Hey, there's a dog out there!
phoebe Oh, that is so unfortunate.
ross What?
phoebe Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
monica Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
phoebe You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
monica Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
phoebe Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
ross Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
phoebe I think on some levels she already knows.
ross Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
phoebe Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
chandler Hey.
ross Hey.
chandler I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
phoebe Why, nobody good?
chandler Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
ross So how many more do you have tomorrow?
chandler Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
monica Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
ross Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
monica What?
ross I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
chandler Umm, how's it going with you guys?
ross Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
phoebe Oh, really?
ross Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
chandler Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
eric Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
chandler Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
eric Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
chandler Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
chandler Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
joey Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
chandler Sure. Ummm. What's up?
joey Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.

phoebe I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
monica Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
phoebe No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
mr_heckles You're disturbing my oboe practice.
phoebe You don't play the oboe!
mr_heckles I could play the oboe!
phoebe Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
mr_heckles Who are you?
eric Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
mr_heckles I'm Chandler's new roommate.

mr_heckles He told me in person.
eric That's weird.
mr_heckles Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
monica Hi, again.
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
monica Thank you soo, much.
chandler Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
monica You want some help with that?
joey Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
monica Whoa! Are you okay?
joey Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
monica It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
joey That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
monica Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
joey Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
monica Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
joey Gotcha.
monica This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
joey Oh, you bet I am!
monica Okay, here's your penis!
monica Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
joey You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
monica So?!
joey Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
monica Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
joey Oh right, right.
monica I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
joey Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
monica It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
monica Pheebs?
phoebe Huh?
monica Where's your bed?
phoebe It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
monica What?
phoebe Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
monica What are you talking about?
phoebe I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
monica Everybody knows!
phoebe That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
monica Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
phoebe Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
monica What?!?!
phoebe Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
monica You can spill. In the sink.
phoebe Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
monica I love you, too.
phoebe Aww, good. What?
monica What? I'm just said.
phoebe No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
chandler So ah, whatcha watching?
joey Baywatch.
chandler What's it about?
joey Lifeguards.
chandler Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
joey Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
chandler Wow! Look at them run.
joey They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
chandler Yeah, I'll go get one.
joey No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
chandler Well, hello!
monica Hey.
chandler Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
monica Help yourself.
chandler You okay?
monica Phoebe moved out.
chandler Right.
monica I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
chandler Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
monica Well, I think so.
chandler Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
ross Hi. Where is everybody?
phoebe Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
ross My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
phoebe Oh no! Why?
ross 'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
phoebe Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
ross I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
phoebe Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
ross Well, now I do!!
phoebe I'm sorry.
ross Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
phoebe Aw, God Ross. Oh.
chandler Umm, this is nice.
monica I know, it is isn't it?
chandler No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
monica Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
chandler Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
monica Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
chandler Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
monica I know. Thanks.
ross Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
phoebe I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
ross Thanks.
phoebe And you're so sweet. And you're kind

phoebe Okay, it's okay.
phoebe Oh.
ross Wait, wait, wait.
phoebe What?
ross My foot is stuck in the pocket.
phoebe What?
ross No, I can't get it out.
phoebe Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
ross No, come on don't start. Ouch!
phoebe What?
ross Stupid balls are in the way.
ross Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
phoebe You have chalk on your face.
ross Huh?
phoebe Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
monica Hey, are you okay?
ross My wife's a lesbian.
