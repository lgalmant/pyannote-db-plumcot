dr_ross_geller Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
chandler_bing No, no, no. No-no-no.
joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Shhhh!
dr_ross_geller What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
chandler_bing No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
dr_ross_geller What? That's like insanely easy!
chandler_bing Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen
monica_geller It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
dr_ross_geller What? You forgot fourteen states?
monica_geller Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
chandler_bing Oh, okay, time's up!
rachel_green All right, I got 48.
chandler_bing Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.
chandler_bing Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
joey_tribbiani Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
dr_ross_geller Wow, how many have you got?
joey_tribbiani Fifty-six!
joey_tribbiani Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
chandler_bing Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
rachel_green How come we have one extra place setting?
monica_geller 'Cause you invited your assistant.
rachel_green Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
monica_geller Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
rachel_green Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
monica_geller Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
phoebe_buffay Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
dr_ross_geller Done! With time a-to-spare.
chandler_bing Oooh that may be a New World's record
dr_ross_geller You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
chandler_bing Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
dr_ross_geller What? That's impossible.
joey_tribbiani 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
monica_geller All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
chandler_bing I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
dr_ross_geller No, just give me another minute.
chandler_bing Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
dr_ross_geller This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
chandler_bing Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
dr_ross_geller You're on!
joey_tribbiani All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
monica_geller Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
joey_tribbiani But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
monica_geller Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
dr_ross_geller Pshhshhh!
monica_geller Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
chandler_bing Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
joey_tribbiani Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's not!
rachel_green Seriously, it's moving!
joey_tribbiani What the hell is in there?
phoebe_buffay It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
monica_geller Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
chandler_bing I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
monica_geller That's my pie!
chandler_bing Which smells delicious!
monica_geller Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
phoebe_buffay Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
monica_geller Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, who's this?
monica_geller Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
chandler_bing Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
phoebe_buffay No, there's no dog here?
monica_geller Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god! Where are you?
monica_geller I'll be right there!
phoebe_buffay They're here already? How are they doing this?
rachel_green Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
tag_jones I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
rachel_green Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
tag_jones We kinda broke up this morning.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry.
tag_jones Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
dr_ross_geller Ohio!! Thank you!
chandler_bing Huh! Where is the dog?!
dr_ross_geller What dog? There-there's no dog here.
joey_tribbiani Yeah that dog left!
monica_geller Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
phoebe_buffay There's no dog in here.
chandler_bing Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
phoebe_buffay No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
chandler_bing What is it doing here?
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
monica_geller Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
chandler_bing Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
phoebe_buffay That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
chandler_bing Really?
monica_geller Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
chandler_bing Well, it still has to go, right?
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Why?
chandler_bing Okay, it's um
joey_tribbiani Don't do it!
monica_geller Don't do what?
chandler_bing I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
all@ What?
phoebe_buffay Are you crazy?
dr_ross_geller Are you out of your mind?
phoebe_buffay Why?
joey_tribbiani Told ya.
chandler_bing They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
dr_ross_geller Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
rachel_green Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
chandler_bing Is there a puppy here?
tag_jones You don't like puppies?
chandler_bing Okay, you are new!
joey_tribbiani Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
phoebe_buffay You don't like ice cream?
dr_ross_geller It's too cold.
chandler_bing Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
dr_ross_geller It hurts my teeth.
chandler_bing And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
dr_ross_geller How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
monica_geller 1250.
dr_ross_geller Damn, I forgot you were here.
phoebe_buffay All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
rachel_green Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'd say about a month.
monica_geller Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
joey_tribbiani Half hour.
rachel_green Interesting.
monica_geller When it's your assistant, I would say never.
joey_tribbiani All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
rachel_green Huh. A moo-point?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
rachel_green Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
monica_geller Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
rachel_green You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
joey_tribbiani Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
rachel_green Hey!
tag_jones Hey.
rachel_green How are you holding up?
tag_jones Not bad.
rachel_green Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
tag_jones Thanks.
rachel_green So were you guys together a long time?
tag_jones A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
rachel_green Now that she broke up with you?
tag_jones Yeah.
rachel_green Yeah. Hmmmm.
tag_jones It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
rachel_green No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
tag_jones Why?
rachel_green Because, uh-it has to.
tag_jones You have all the answers, don't you?
rachel_green Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
tag_jones Hey, thanks for talking to me.
rachel_green Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
joey_tribbiani All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
tag_jones What?
joey_tribbiani Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
tag_jones What did Joey say? I like you back?
rachel_green Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
tag_jones Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
rachel_green No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
tag_jones Wow.
rachel_green Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
tag_jones Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
rachel_green What?
tag_jones Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
rachel_green Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
tag_jones I can't believe this!
rachel_green Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
monica_geller Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
phoebe_buffay Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
monica_geller Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay.
monica_geller Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
phoebe_buffay You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
monica_geller That's not gonna work.
phoebe_buffay I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
monica_geller Hey! I didn't know either.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
monica_geller Yeah, I knew.
phoebe_buffay Where's Chandler?
chandler_bing Here I am.
phoebe_buffay Wash your hands!!!
chandler_bing How did you...know?
dr_ross_geller Hey! What's she doing back here?
monica_geller Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
dr_ross_geller Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
phoebe_buffay No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
phoebe_buffay See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
chandler_bing Where's Monica?
dr_ross_geller Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
chandler_bing Why not?
dr_ross_geller Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
chandler_bing Well, I, I should go in there.
dr_ross_geller No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
chandler_bing Why not?
dr_ross_geller Because you sent away the dog!
chandler_bing This is ridiculous.
dr_ross_geller Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
joey_tribbiani Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
chandler_bing Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
joey_tribbiani So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
chandler_bing Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
joey_tribbiani Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
chandler_bing And that doesn't scare you?
joey_tribbiani Ross, you need some help?
dr_ross_geller From you? Yes, please!
joey_tribbiani First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
dr_ross_geller I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
rachel_green Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
joey_tribbiani If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
phoebe_buffay Hey, is Chandler here?
chandler_bing No, no he went for a walk.
phoebe_buffay Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
phoebe_buffay Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
joey_tribbiani You think?
monica_geller Hi, honey.
chandler_bing Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
monica_geller What? Why, why would...
phoebe_buffay Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
chandler_bing Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
phoebe_buffay We have good news, look whose back!
rachel_green Hi!
chandler_bing Clunkers?! Oh my god!
monica_geller That's right, she came back all by herself.
phoebe_buffay It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
chandler_bing It is so good to see you!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
dr_ross_geller Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
chandler_bing It's up to you.
rachel_green Oh, hi! How are you doing?
tag_jones I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
rachel_green Oh.
tag_jones Thanks for having me over, you guys.
dr_ross_geller Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
tag_jones Colorado.
dr_ross_geller Ah, what good are you.
rachel_green Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
tag_jones Okay.
rachel_green Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
tag_jones Um, I'm not.
rachel_green Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
tag_jones No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
rachel_green Really?
tag_jones Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
rachel_green Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
dr_ross_geller Delaware! Delaware!
chandler_bing All right.
dr_ross_geller I want my turkey now!
chandler_bing You got it. You got Nevada twice.
dr_ross_geller I know.
chandler_bing Yeah.
