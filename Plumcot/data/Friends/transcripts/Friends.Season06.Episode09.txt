monica_geller Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
chandler_bing Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
monica_geller I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
chandler_bing Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
monica_geller Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
chandler_bing Why can't I tell them that we live together?
monica_geller Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
chandler_bing Why haven't you told them?!
monica_geller Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
chandler_bing Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
monica_geller So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
chandler_bing Why wouldn't they be happy?
monica_geller Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
chandler_bing What? What? Why?!
monica_geller Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
chandler_bing Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
monica_geller Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
monica_geller You really think that'll work?
chandler_bing Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
monica_geller I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
chandler_bing Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
dr_ross_geller Yes, of course they like you!
chandler_bing Well Monica just told me that they don't.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, they don't like you.
chandler_bing Do you know why?
dr_ross_geller I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
chandler_bing Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
chandler_bing This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
joey_tribbiani Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
chandler_bing Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
joey_tribbiani Well maybe I love ya'.
janine_lecroix Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
janine_lecroix Hey guys!
dr_ross_geller No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
janine_lecroix Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
janine_lecroix Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
dr_ross_geller For real?
janine_lecroix No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
joey_tribbiani Ye-ye, we go to yours!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
janine_lecroix Okay.
joey_tribbiani How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
all@ Hey!
rachel_green Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
phoebe_buffay Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
monica_geller Nothing.
rachel_green Nothing?
monica_geller No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
rachel_green So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
monica_geller You're not gonna mess it up.
rachel_green Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
monica_geller Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Hey!
all@ Hey!
joey_tribbiani Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
dr_ross_geller And the place looks so nice!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
dr_ross_geller Happy Thanksgiving!
the_girls#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode09 Happy Thanksgiving!
joey_tribbiani Well, this has been great!
dr_ross_geller See ya!
monica_geller Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
monica_geller Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
dr_ross_geller Some would say she's attractive, yes.
phoebe_buffay And who else is going to be there?
joey_tribbiani Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
rachel_green Her dancer friends?
joey_tribbiani Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
dr_ross_geller Dude, we were good!
monica_geller You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
dr_ross_geller Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
judy_geller Hello everybody!
jack_geller Hi!
all@ Hi!
monica_geller Dad , Mom Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
judy_geller Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
chandler_bing Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
chandler_bing Whoa, snowing out there?
jack_geller No.
jack_geller Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
jack_geller Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
monica_geller Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
jack_geller My joke wasn't funny.
phoebe_buffay Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
rachel_green Really?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
rachel_green I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
monica_geller Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
chandler_bing Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
jack_geller I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
chandler_bing He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
joey_tribbiani Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
rachel_green Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, what is it?
rachel_green It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
dr_ross_geller W-What was the one right before bananas?
rachel_green The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
joey_tribbiani Y-sure!
rachel_green And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Okay.
dr_ross_geller Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
joey_tribbiani I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
joey_tribbiani Chandler!
dr_ross_geller Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
joey_tribbiani Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
dr_ross_geller No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
joey_tribbiani Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
joey_tribbiani Vomiting stories are funny...
rachel_green Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
joey_tribbiani Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
rachel_green No!
joey_tribbiani Still not hot enough!
phoebe_buffay Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
monica_geller Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
judy_geller Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
chandler_bing Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
jack_geller What's the matter with him?
judy_geller I think he's stoned again.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
chandler_bing You do? Why?
dr_ross_geller Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
chandler_bing What?! Why did you do that?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
chandler_bing How could it not matter?!
dr_ross_geller How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
chandler_bing What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, I-I was all high.
monica_geller Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
chandler_bing Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
monica_geller Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
chandler_bing The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
monica_geller You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
dr_ross_geller Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
monica_geller Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
phoebe_buffay Monica, leave him alone!
joey_tribbiani Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
rachel_green No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
joey_tribbiani Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
rachel_green Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
rachel_green So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
joey_tribbiani Oh I am!
monica_geller Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
dr_ross_geller Okay, fine!
joey_tribbiani Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
dr_ross_geller Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
joey_tribbiani Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
dr_ross_geller What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
joey_tribbiani Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
joey_tribbiani Dude, they're not objects.
joey_tribbiani Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
rachel_green Okay...
rachel_green What's up, Ross?
dr_ross_geller So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller And um...You look nice today.
rachel_green Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
dr_ross_geller Eh?
rachel_green I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
dr_ross_geller You're alone.
rachel_green No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
joey_tribbiani Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
joey_tribbiani Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
rachel_green Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
joey_tribbiani Really?
rachel_green No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
phoebe_buffay So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
rachel_green It sure is.
phoebe_buffay Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
rachel_green Beef.
phoebe_buffay I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
rachel_green Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
monica_geller Really?
rachel_green Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
rachel_green Well?
monica_geller Mmmm! It's good!
rachel_green Really? How good?
monica_geller It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
all@ Mmm.
chandler_bing Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
judy_geller I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
jack_geller I'll help you dial.
monica_geller I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
rachel_green Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
dr_ross_geller Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
dr_ross_geller It tastes like feet!
joey_tribbiani I like it.
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding?
joey_tribbiani What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
rachel_green ..So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
chandler_bing Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
phoebe_buffay Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
rachel_green Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
phoebe_buffay I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
rachel_green Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
jack_geller Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
phoebe_buffay Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
monica_geller Ross? Let's go.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
monica_geller Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
dr_ross_geller Wha-what?
monica_geller Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
jack_geller@judy_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
jack_geller@judy_geller Yes.
dr_ross_geller Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
judy_geller It was you?
monica_geller And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
monica_geller Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
dr_ross_geller Monica and Chandler are living together!
monica_geller Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
phoebe_buffay I love Jacques Cousteau!
rachel_green I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
joey_tribbiani I wanna gooooooo!
judy_geller That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
jack_geller And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
judy_geller Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
jack_geller What happened son?
dr_ross_geller I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
judy_geller Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
chandler_bing Thank you!
jack_geller No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
chandler_bing I'll talk to them!
rachel_green You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
monica_geller Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
joey_tribbiani No it isn't, I ate that.
judy_geller Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
joey_tribbiani Nope, got it and I got yours too.
