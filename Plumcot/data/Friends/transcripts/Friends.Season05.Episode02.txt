monica_geller Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
dr_ross_geller Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
monica_geller No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?

dr_ross_geller That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
rachel_green Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
dr_ross_geller So, what? That's it?
rachel_green Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
dr_ross_geller Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
rachel_green Oh no, you're the best.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
chandler_bing Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
monica_geller Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
rachel_green What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
chandler_bing Oh that's not true.
rachel_green Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
phoebe_buffay London is stupid! Stupid!
rachel_green Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
phoebe_buffay Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
monica_geller I'll do it!
rachel_green That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
chandler_bing Okay, I gotta go to work.
chandler_bing And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
chandler_bing Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
monica_geller Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
rachel_green Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
monica_geller Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
rachel_green I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it
monica_geller Ohh.
rachel_green ...I mean it's my fault.
monica_geller Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
rachel_green Oh my God!
monica_geller Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
joey_tribbiani I bet it was about her a little.
monica_geller If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
rachel_green Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda
monica_geller Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
rachel_green Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
monica_geller You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
rachel_green All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.

all@ Sorry.
monica_geller What happened?

monica_geller Oh, good.
chandler_bing So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
joey_tribbiani See ya!! What the hell was that?!
monica_geller Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
rachel_green That's not European!
phoebe_buffay Well, it felt French.
rachel_green Oh God, I really had a good time!
dave Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
rachel_green Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
dave Yeah!
rachel_green Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
dave Okay, yeah!
rachel_green Umm, hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
dr_ross_geller She's doing her laundry.
rachel_green What's that?
dr_ross_geller It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
rachel_green Oh, honey that's awful.
dr_ross_geller Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
rachel_green But, it's not raining.
dr_ross_geller I can't catch a break!
rachel_green Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
dave Yeah?
rachel_green Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
monica_geller Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
rachel_green Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
monica_geller I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
rachel_green Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
monica_geller What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
rachel_green Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
monica_geller I make the decisions, and I say no.
rachel_green Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
monica_geller You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
rachel_green Well
monica_geller Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
joey_tribbiani Havin' some trouble?
monica_geller Rachel locked the door.
joey_tribbiani I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
monica_geller Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
monica_geller Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
rachel_green No.
monica_geller I really need to talk to you.
rachel_green Well, then talk!
monica_geller Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
rachel_green Yes!
dr_ross_geller What thing?
monica_geller Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
dr_ross_geller Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
rachel_green I'm gonna do it.
monica_geller All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
rachel_green But I
monica_geller Please!
rachel_green All right, fine.
monica_geller Joey, I'm in!
joey_tribbiani All right. Good deal.
all@ Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
joey_tribbiani Uh, okay, Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
joey_tribbiani All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
phoebe_buffay Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
monica_geller Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
phoebe_buffay Central... Park!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, all of us! All day!
phoebe_buffay That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
chandler_bing Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
rachel_green Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
chandler_bing I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
phoebe_buffay That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
monica_geller Makes me wanna puke!
dr_ross_geller Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
joey_tribbiani Phoebe!
chandler_bing Hey, Pheebs!
rachel_green Phoebe, woo!
phoebe_buffay Okay, woo! Hi.
chandler_bing Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
joey_tribbiani Mine!
dr_ross_geller Wait! It was my plan.
joey_tribbiani Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
dr_ross_geller And, I came up with Atlantic City.
joey_tribbiani Which, is the new plan!
monica_geller Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
phoebe_buffay Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
monica_geller Come on Rach, let's go.
rachel_green Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
monica_geller No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
rachel_green Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
monica_geller Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
rachel_green Yeah, I-I don't care.
monica_geller Okay. I-I can't watch.
rachel_green What 'cha readin'?
dr_ross_geller The paper.
rachel_green Yeah, what's it about?
dr_ross_geller Events from around the globe.
rachel_green Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
dr_ross_geller Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
rachel_green Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Go ahead.
rachel_green Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
dr_ross_geller Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
dr_ross_geller What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
rachel_green I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
dr_ross_geller Why are you laughing?
rachel_green Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
dr_ross_geller Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
rachel_green I'm sorry, that's not funny.
dr_ross_geller Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
rachel_green Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
dr_ross_geller Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
rachel_green The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
dr_ross_geller That is what the thing is.
rachel_green Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
dr_ross_geller No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
rachel_green That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
dr_ross_geller No thank you for... Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Okay, let's go!
chandler_bing Atlantic City!

phoebe_buffay Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
monica_geller I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
chandler_bing I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
chandler_bing Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
monica_geller Do you know anything about women?
chandler_bing No.
monica_geller That's all right.
chandler_bing Okay.
