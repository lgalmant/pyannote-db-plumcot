rachel Hey Pheebs?
phoebe Huh?
rachel I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
phoebe Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy.
rachel Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
phoebe Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.
rachel No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
phoebe Oh. Why not?
rachel 'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
phoebe Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'
rachel What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
phoebe Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
rachel Thank you.
phoebe Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
monica No you don't!
rachel No you don't.
phoebe Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
chandler Her what?!!
phoebe Your secret bachelorette party
chandler You had a bachelorette party?!
phoebe She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
chandler I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
joey It's a grand tradition!
monica I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
rachel Well you could've untied it with your hands.
joey This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
chandler You went home with the waitress.
joey Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
chandler I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
monica Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
dr_green How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
phoebe Oh, I-I don't eat meat.
dr_green It's chicken.
phoebe Yeah, I don't eat that either.
dr_green I'll never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell me...what is new with you.
rachel Well actually umm
waiter Your '74 Lafite sir.
dr_green '74?! I ordered the '75! That's a magnificent wine! The '74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
waiter This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight!
dr_green Oh come on! Don't be such a baby!
rachel In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
phoebe He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
rachel This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
phoebe Rachel!
rachel No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
phoebe Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
rachel Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
dr_green I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
rachel Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
dr_green What's TiVo?
phoebe It's slang for pregnant.
rachel Phoebe!
dr_green Are you really pregnant?
rachel Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
dr_green Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her!
rachel No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!
dr_green That's true.
rachel Yeah.
dr_green Poppy. Oh, I'm gonna be a poppy. So when is the wedding?
rachel Who?
dr_green The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
rachel February 2nd!
mona So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
ross Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
mona Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y'know take it all in.
ross Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
mona So, I gotta get going.
ross Okay, I-I'll see you tonight.
mona Yeah.
ross Okay, bye.
mona Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!
chandler My God! You must be good in bed!
joey So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
ross Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so
joey Hot?
ross Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
chandler She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
ross Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
chandler Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
joey I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
monica Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
chandler What?
monica Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
chandler Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper
joey Will you let the lady talk?!
monica Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
chandler Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
monica So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.
ross Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
monica Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
chandler All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
joey Yeah!
chandler And Joey.
monica Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
chandler Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
ross Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
chandler I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
joey I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
phoebe I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
rachel I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
phoebe It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
rachel All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
dr_green I just called a friend of mine.
rachel Yeah?
dr_green I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
rachel Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
dr_green What is it sweetie?
rachel There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
dr_green What?!
rachel I'm sorry daddy.
dr_green I don't believe this!!
rachel Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
dr_green Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
rachel Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
joey So you uh, nervous about getting married?
chandler What are you doing?
joey Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
chandler Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
joey How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
chandler You're right, this is more fun.
joey That's her! Okay, come on!
stripper Hi!
chandler Hi.
stripper So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
joey Uh, that-that's-that's me!
chandler That's me.
joey Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
stripper So is that a bedroom?
chandler Yeah, yeah right over there.
stripper All right, whenever you're ready.
chandler That was weird.
joey Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
stripper I'm waiting.
chandler So she's a
joey Yeah, that's one naked hooker!
mona I love your place! Where is this guy from?
ross Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
mona Oh wow! So, you're more than just dinosaurs.
ross So much more.
mona Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
ross Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. Sorry.
dr_green You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!
ross Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
dr_green So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
mona You got Rachel pregnant?!
ross Who did?!
dr_green You did!
ross Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
dr_green Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
ross No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
mona What?!
ross Oh but not that way. I mean...I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
dr_green Oh really? That's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
ross Hey! I offered to marry her!
mona Wh
ross But I didn't want to.
dr_green Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
mona Tramp?!
ross I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
chandler I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
joey Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
chandler Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
hooker Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking
joey Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
chandler That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
joey I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
hooker Do you mind if I smoke in here?
chandler Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
mona How could you have kept all of this from me?
ross I was going to tell you, but
dr_green But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
ross Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?
joey Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
ross No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down.
stu So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
monica Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
stu No problem. So who's the party for?
monica My husband.
stu You hired your husband a hooker?
monica She's a stripper.
stu No, she's a hooker.
monica Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
stu When they're hookers.
monica Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
stu Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
joey Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
chandler Why would she do that?
joey Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
chandler This is the worst bachelor party ever!
hooker What's taking you boys so long?
joey In a minute!
chandler In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
joey All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
chandler Why me?!
joey Hey! It's your bachelor party.
chandler Which is why you should do it.
joey I don't want to. You do it!
chandler You do it!
joey You do it!
chandler All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
joey I miss this.
chandler I don't think we've actually done this before!
joey No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
chandler Well we...we still hang out.
joey Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
chandler Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.
joey Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?
chandler Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
joey You got it. Come here.
hooker Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
monica She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
ross So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!
rachel Oh no
phoebe I'd better go. Just over here: I don't want to miss the fight.
rachel Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
ross I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
rachel Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
ross Rachel!
rachel All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
ross Okay!
rachel Okay.
ross Thank you!
phoebe That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
ross Thank you so much for coming back over.
mona Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
rachel I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
ross Focus.
rachel Okay. Um...But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
mona How can I be sure on that?
rachel Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
ross Yeah.
rachel I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
ross Trying to date this woman.
rachel Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
ross Probably shouldn't touch me.
mona Y'know, I-I-I just...I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
rachel I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.
ross Should I leave this open for you too?
mona I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
ross Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
mona Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
ross I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
mona Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
rachel Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
monica I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
chandler Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
monica Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.
chandler Monica! Wait!
monica What?
chandler Carry on.
monica Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.
chandler Could you not narrate?
monica Gotcha sailor.
dr_green ...just because you're not in love with the guy you can't
phoebe Wow, you told your dad the truth.
rachel About an hour ago.
phoebe Wanna go see a movie?
rachel Yes! Bye daddy.
dr_green ...there's gonna be a wedding! That's unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love!..constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
joey Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
