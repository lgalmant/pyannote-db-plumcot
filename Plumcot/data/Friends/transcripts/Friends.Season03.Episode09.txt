the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode09 Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
phoebe_buffay Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode09 We will.
monica_geller Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
rachel_green No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
monica_geller Every year.
phoebe_buffay Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things.
dr_ross_geller Halftime.
joey_tribbiani Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
rachel_green Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
phoebe_buffay Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
joey_tribbiani Great, you can cover Chandler.
chandler_bing No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
joey_tribbiani Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
chandler_bing That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
joey_tribbiani Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
chandler_bing Yeah, all right, I'll play.
phoebe_buffay Yay!!
rachel_green Let's do it! Ross?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Do you wanna play football?
dr_ross_geller Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
joey_tribbiani Says who? Your mom?
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
chandler_bing No, no, no, you say that proudly.
monica_geller Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
dr_ross_geller It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
monica_geller To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
dr_ross_geller Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
monica_geller I won the game.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
rachel_green Um, there was a Geller Cup?
dr_ross_geller Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
chandler_bing And was the curse lifted?
dr_ross_geller Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
monica_geller Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
dr_ross_geller Can I see you for a second?
monica_geller Once!!
dr_ross_geller All right, we're gonna play.
chandler_bing But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
monica_geller Okay. Let's bring it in.
rachel_green Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
dr_ross_geller Here you go.
rachel_green That almost hit me in the face.
joey_tribbiani All right, we have to pick captains.
chandler_bing And then Tineals.
phoebe_buffay Okay, so how do we decide that?
monica_geller Well, why don't we just bunny up.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller Bunny!
monica_geller Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.

dr_ross_geller Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
rachel_green Ross!

chandler_bing Well, that went well.
joey_tribbiani I think so.
chandler_bing Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
joey_tribbiani Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
chandler_bing Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
chandler_bing Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?

chandler_bing Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
dr_ross_geller Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..

phoebe_buffay Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
dr_ross_geller Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.

dr_ross_geller Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

phoebe_buffay Woo-yay!!
monica_geller No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
dr_ross_geller Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
monica_geller Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
dr_ross_geller Oh really! Why is that?

dr_ross_geller The Geller Cup.
chandler_bing Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
all@ Yeah.
chandler_bing Okay, good.
dr_ross_geller Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!

rachel_green All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
monica_geller Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
joey_tribbiani It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
monica_geller All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
joey_tribbiani What are you gonna do?
monica_geller All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.

dr_ross_geller Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
monica_geller What?! I just touched him and he went over.
dr_ross_geller Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
phoebe_buffay I love this game!!
dr_ross_geller Hey, where'd you get that?
rachel_green I went really long.
monica_geller Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
dr_ross_geller It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
monica_geller You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
monica_geller Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
dr_ross_geller What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
monica_geller Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
dr_ross_geller Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
rachel_green I can not believe your trading me!!
monica_geller Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
rachel_green Are you gonna let me play?
monica_geller All right then.
margha The game is over, we eat now?
chandler_bing No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
dr_ross_geller Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
chandler_bing No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
joey_tribbiani Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
chandler_bing And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
joey_tribbiani Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
margha Oh, my.
dr_ross_geller Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
chandler_bing Fine with me.
dr_ross_geller Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
margha Which do I like?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
margha Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
chandler_bing Yes!!
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
chandler_bing Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
margha I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
chandler_bing You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
margha I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
chandler_bing Wh-what?
margha I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
joey_tribbiani Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
chandler_bing Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
dr_ross_geller Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
chandler_bing We're not gonna lose to girls.
dr_ross_geller Hey! It's 42-21!
joey_tribbiani This sucks, I was just up by that much!
monica_geller Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
monica_geller We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
monica_geller Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
rachel_green Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
phoebe_buffay All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
monica_geller All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
rachel_green No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
monica_geller Honey, there's a reason.
rachel_green God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
phoebe_buffay Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.

joey_tribbiani Thirty seconds left on the timer!
chandler_bing Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
monica_geller Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
phoebe_buffay Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
monica_geller All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Break!
rachel_green I got a touchdown! We did it!!
chandler_bing Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
phoebe_buffay Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
dr_ross_geller Let go! Let go!
monica_geller Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
chandler_bing Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
monica_geller Ow!!

phoebe_buffay Isn't there a national football league.

rachel_green Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.

monica_geller Let go!
dr_ross_geller No! You let go!
monica_geller No!
dr_ross_geller How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
