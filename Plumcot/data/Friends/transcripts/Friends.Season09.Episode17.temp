chandler Hey! Ready to go?
ross Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
joey Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!
chandler What are you doin'?
ross Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
chandler Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
ross It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
chandler The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
ross Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
chandler Bet she'd sleep with you now...
ross No... I already e-mailed her.
chandler Let me see what you wrote about yourself
ross You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
joey Hey!
ross What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
chandler Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
joey No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
ross Alright, let's go!
joey Dude!
ross I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
joey aaand SEND!
rachel Hey! How was basketball?
joey Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
rachel Oh, no! Who did that?
joey Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
rachel She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
joey Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
rachel Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
joey Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
rachel All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
joey Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
phoebe Hi.
monica Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
phoebe Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
chandler Oh, I'm so sorry!
phoebe Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
chandler You're not gonna need my help?
phoebe Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
chandler Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth
phoebe Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
monica Ok, you got it!
phoebe Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
monica Really? If that's what you want...
phoebe That was a test and you just failed.
monica Damn it! Rookie mistake!
ross I have sex with dinosaurs??
chandler I believe I read that somewhere!
ross That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
chandler I respectfully disagree.
ross I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
chandler Who cares? Nobody reads those things
ross You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
chandler I don't have a page.
ross Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
joey Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
joey It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
rachel What are you doing?
joey Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
rachel Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
joey There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
monica Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
chandler Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
monica But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
chandler Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
monica Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
chandler Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .
monica What are you doing?
chandler Oh, you'll see my friend.
ross I'm dead?
chandler And so young.
ross Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
chandler Well, how you died was funny.
ross Oh please, hit by a blimp?
chandler It kills over one americans every year.
ross Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
chandler You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
ross You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
phoebe God, I wish Mike were here.
monica Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
monica What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
phoebe I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
monica Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
phoebe Here.
monica And now your cell.
phoebe Okay
monica This is your cellphone?
phoebe Yes.
monica This is your current cellphone?
phoebe Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
monica Phoebe, where's your purse?
monica No, no! Give it to me!
phoebe You can't have it.
monica Give it to me!
phoebe No
monica I'll go in there.
phoebe Oh yeah.
monica Phoebe come here
monica Haha!
phoebe Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
joey Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
rachel Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
joey No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
rachel Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
joey No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
rachel Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
joey Make the transfer!
rachel Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
joey Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
rachel Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
joey But he's the same.
rachel Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
joey But he's the same.
rachel Joey, come on!
joey He's the same!
joey You're not the same!
monica Haha!
phoebe You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
monica So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
phoebe Those are my shoes.
monica Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
phoebe Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
monica Who's that?
phoebe I ordered Chinese food.
phoebe What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
monica What are you doing here?
mike Phoebe called me.
monica Phoebe!
phoebe I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
monica Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
phoebe There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
monica Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
mike Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
monica This doesn't concern you!!
mike Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
monica Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
phoebe Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
monica Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .
phoebe Sit down.
monica Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
mike So how've you been?
monica I've been pretty good!
mike You look really beautiful.
phoebe Thanks, you look good too.
monica Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
phoebe So how's the piano playing going?
mike Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
phoebe I've missed you too.
monica You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
chandler Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
ross uhu uhu, check this out.
chandler Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
ross Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
chandler No, come on, you know that's not true.
ross What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
chandler Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
ross I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
chandler Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
ross You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
chandler Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
ross Exactly!!
chandler Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
ross No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
chandler Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
ross oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
rachel I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
joey Original or crappy?
rachel Original.
joey No, sorry haven't seen him.
rachel Then what's that big lump under your covers?
joey It's Monica, ok?
rachel That's not Monica!
joey Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
rachel Oh God.
joey ... she's being unreasonable!
rachel Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
joey It does?
rachel Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
joey Really? She... she loves me?
rachel Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .
joey Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
rachel Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!
joey Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
rachel Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
joey How do you think I got him in the first place?
monica Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss
mike I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
phoebe I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
mike It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
monica Kiss him, you fool!!
phoebe What?
monica Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
phoebe Oh, I missed you so much!
strange_man I knew you'd be here!
mike Oh, crap!
phoebe Who is this?
mike My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
monica Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
manny Well, you are not doing a very good job!
monica Excuse me?
manny What's with the kissing?
monica Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
manny Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
monica You didn't hear the speech!
manny I've heard the speech
monica Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
manny You're weak!
monica You're... weird!
manny Your pants are undone!
monica Oh !
manny Where did they go?
monica Damn it!
manny Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
monica And I blame you too.
ross It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
chandler There you go! Someone came!
ross Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
monica Hi, glad you could come.
chandler Please, come in.
tom Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
chandler Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
tom Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
chandler At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps
ross Who is he?
chandler Some guy, Tom Gordon.
ross I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
monica So, did you know Ross well?
tom Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
monica Yes, he is. Me.
tom What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
chandler Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
tom Hey, listen. Call me.
chandler Ok!
ross I'm dead and no one cares?
monica I look like a man??
chandler Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
ross It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
chandler You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
ross Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
chandler Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
ross Yeah...
chandler I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
kori Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
chandler Kori? Kori Weston?
kori Yeah...
chandler Wow! You look amazing!
kori And you are...
chandler Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
monica You are married though.
chandler Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
kori I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
chandler I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
kori We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
chandler I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
kori I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
ross But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
kori You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
ross Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
ross No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?
