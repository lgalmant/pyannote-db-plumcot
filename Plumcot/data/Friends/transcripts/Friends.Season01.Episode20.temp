chandler I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
joey No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
ross I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
monica Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
ross I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
rachel Oh, that is so sick.
chandler I feel violated. And not in a good way.
phoebe How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
chandler I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
monica So have you called her yet?
chandler Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
joey_and_ross Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
monica I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
phoebe Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
chandler Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
joey Her answer machine?
chandler No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
phoebe So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
chandler Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
monica Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
ross Okay, okay, what's going on?
phoebe Okay, they're just talking...
ross Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
phoebe No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
ross What? What? What?!
phoebe That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
chandler And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
all Oh!... Right!
chandler Hey Rach!
monica How'd it go?
rachel Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
phoebe Not a good day for birds...
rachel Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
ross That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
rachel Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
ross That's, that's nice twice!
monica Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
joey Duh, where've you been?
rachel Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
chandler Yes!
rachel Why?
chandler I have my reasons.
monica Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
rachel All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
rachel Wow... Wow!
barry Yeah.
rachel I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
barry Nooo, it wasn't.
rachel Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
chandler Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
monica That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
chandler Hey, I've been honing!
ross What was with the dishes?
chandler Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
monica Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
phoebe Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
monica Great, now he's waving back.
joey Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
monica What kinda stuff?
joey Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
phoebe You cook naked?
joey Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
chandler What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
barry What's the matter?
rachel Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
barry No, it was. It was very very good.
rachel Well, what about Mindy?
barry Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
rachel No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
barry Well, if you want, I'll just-I'll just break it off with her.
rachel No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
bernice Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
barry Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
rachel Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
barry We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
rachel I had a bra.
bobby Hey, Dr. Farber.
barry All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
rachel What?!
bobby I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
chandler Can I use your phone?
monica Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
chandler Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
joey Maybe she never got your message.
phoebe Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
chandler Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
ross ..desperate, needy, pathetic?
chandler Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
phoebe How many beeps?
chandler She answered.
monica Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
chandler I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
all Hey! Hi!
phoebe How'd he take it?
rachel Pretty well, actually...
monica Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
rachel Oh, do I?
monica Uh huh.
rachel We ended up having sex in his chair.
monica You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
ross You-you had what?
phoebe Sex in his chair.
ross What, uh... what were you thinking?
rachel I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
ross No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
rachel Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
chandler If it helps, I could slide over.
ross It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
phoebe Where are you going?
ross I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
chandler Hello? Hello?
rachel Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
chandler So how's Mindy?
rachel Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
monica Brrrrrrr!
chandler Hell is filled with people like you.
joey He's back! The peeper's back!
joey Get down!
rachel Get down?
chandler ..And boogie!
rachel Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
monica Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
rachel Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
joey Yeah?
rachel And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
joey .Naughty!
rachel Right, I'll see you guys later...
joey Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
chandler Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
monica Why don't you just take it with you?
chandler Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
monica Why don't you just call her?
chandler I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
monica Do you?
chandler No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
monica Don't you have to pee?
chandler 'S'why I'm dancing...
rachel Mindy.
mindy Hey, you.
rachel Hey, you.... So, what's up?
mindy Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
rachel Sure we should... So.
mindy Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
rachel Okay.
mindy Will you be my maid of honour?
rachel Of course!
mindy Oh that's so great!
rachel Was that all you wanted to ask me?
mindy That's all!
rachel Ohhhh!!.What? What?
mindy That's not all.
rachel Oh sure it is!
mindy Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
rachel Um, what- what would make you think that?
mindy Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
rachel Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
mindy Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
rachel What? What's what you were afraid of?
mindy Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
rachel What?
mindy I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
rachel Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
mindy What do you mean?
rachel Smell familiar?
mindy Oh no.
rachel Oh, I am so sorry.
mindy No me, I am so sorry...
joey Oh my.
ross Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
chandler Ring dammit, ring!
ross Thanks.
joey Hey, you know our phone's not working?
chandler What?!
joey I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
chandler I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
monica Just like you told her you did!. Just pointing out the irony.
joey Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
chandler Nngghhh!!!!!!!
joey Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
ross "Heating device."
phoebe Radiator.

joey Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
monica So she's a woman! So what?
joey Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like--Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
monica Joey!!
joey Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
monica The green dress? Really?
joey Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
monica Nooo!
rachel Hey. Got a second?
barry Sure, sure. Come on....in...
mindy Hello, sweetheart.
barry Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
rachel Uh, we are here to break up with you.
barry Both of you?
mindy Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
barry I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
rachel Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
barry ...Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
rachel Even when we were having sex in that chair?
barry I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
rachel Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
mindy You did it twice?
rachel Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
mindy Okay...
barry Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
bernice Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
barry Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
rachel Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
mindy Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
rachel What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
mindy Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
rachel Oh God.
mindy I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
rachel And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
monica You okay?
rachel Yeah.
monica Really?
rachel Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
monica Aww...
joey Big day.
joey All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
phoebe You know he's gay?
ross I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
danielle Chandler?
chandler Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
all Hi. Hi.
chandler What are you doing here?
danielle Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
chandler ..I'm, I'm okay.
danielle Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
chandler That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
danielle You got it.
chandler Okay.
danielle G'bye, everybody.
all Bye.
phoebe Whoo-hoo!
monica Yeah, there you go!
ross Second date!
chandler ..I dunno.
rachel You don't know?!
chandler Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
