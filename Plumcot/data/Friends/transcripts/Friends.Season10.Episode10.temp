monica Mmh... this cake is amazing!
rachel My God, get a room!
monica I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
phoebe If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
monica Sex!
chandler Seriously, answer faster!
monica Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
chandler It's like a giant hug.
phoebe Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
ross Food.
phoebe Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
ross Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
rachel Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
joey Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
rachel No, you gotta pick one!
joey Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
rachel You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
phoebe Oh, how cute!
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
rachel Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
phoebe Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
rachel Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
phoebe OH! He's having an affair.
rachel He's not having an affair!
phoebe You know, I'm always right about these things.
rachel No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
phoebe Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
rachel Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
phoebe Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
chandler Hello.
phoebe Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so.....I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
chandler Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
phoebe Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
chandler Those are all really old!
phoebe Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
rachel "Dude, Where's My Car?"
phoebe What?
rachel They're in a caaar...
phoebe Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
rachel Geez!
phoebe Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
rachel Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
phoebe I got them!
chandler Hi!
monica Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
chandler I was in the car with Nancy all day.
monica Nancy doesn't smoke!
chandler Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
monica So? What do you think of the house?
chandler It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
monica Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
chandler And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
monica Don't you love the huge yard?
chandler And the fireplace in the bedroom.
monica And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
chandler This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
monica So? Do you think we should get it?
chandler I don't know. What do you think?
monica I think we should.
chandler I do too.
monica This is huge!
chandler I know.
monica How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
chandler I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
monica Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
chandler We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
monica Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
chandler I know. Gooooood luck with it.
ross I just can't see Chandler cheating!
rachel I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
joey Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
ross I know, and with the baby coming?
phoebe So, should we tell her?
ross I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
phoebe Why? Who'd you seen him with?
ross No one, I'm just saying if...
phoebe TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
ross I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
phoebe All right. He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
ross Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I...
phoebe WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
rachel Oh, look at her, so happy!
monica If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
joey Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
monica No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?
phoebe Well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.
monica All right...
ross We think Chandler might be having an affair.
monica What?
rachel Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
phoebe They went in together. So sorry.
monica Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
phoebe What?
joey Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
monica Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
chandler Hey!
joey You son of a bitch!
chandler Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
monica Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
rachel Who's Nancy?
ross What's going on?
monica Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
chandler Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
joey I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
phoebe Why do you have a realtor?
monica Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
joey What?
rachel Are you serious?
monica When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
phoebe So you're gonna move?
ross Oh my God.
joey Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
rachel What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
monica And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
chandler ..and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
ross So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
phoebe Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
ross You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
joey No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
ross It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
chandler Actually, we already found a house we love.
ross What?
monica And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
chandler Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
ross You put an offer on a house?
monica It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
phoebe Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
chandler I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
joey Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
chandler You know that's not the reason Joe.
monica We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
rachel Yeah it is.
joey What the hell are you doin'?
rachel Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
phoebe Yeah, but so is this.
ross Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
rachel C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
ross You can see where he'd have trouble.
rachel Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
monica Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
ross That money is mine, Green!
rachel You're fly is open, Geller!
phoebe You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
chandler Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
phoebe Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
rachel Ow, that had to hurt!
phoebe Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
the_guys We will.
monica Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
rachel No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
monica Every year.
joey It's stuck!!!
phoebe Easy. Step. How did it get on?
joey I put it on to scare Chandler!
phoebe Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
joey It smells really bad in here.
phoebe Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
monica Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
joey It's Joey.
monica I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
rachel Oooohh that's interesting.
chandler If you win, we give up the birds.
joey Dah!!
chandler But if we win, we get your apartment.
joey Oooooh!
monica Deal!
ross What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
joey Big fat goalie.
ross Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
chandler Dangerous Liaisons.
ross Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
joey Weekend at Bernie's.
ross Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
joey Everyday use.
chandler Fancy.
joey Guest.
chandler Fancy guest.
ross Two seconds...
joey Uhh, 11!
ross 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
ross Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
rachel 14?
ross No, 19.
chandler Thanks man.
ross Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
monica Maurice.
ross Correct, his profession was?
rachel Space cowboy!
ross Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
rachel Ow...Oh Gosh!
ross 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
monica It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
rachel Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
monica That's not even a word!
monica NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
rachel Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
joey Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
rachel That is not true. She did! She forced me!
monica Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
rachel Well it stupid, unfair question!
ross Don't blame the questions!
chandler Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
ross Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
chandler Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
monica Hey Ross. What's up bro?
ross What the hell are doing?!!
rachel Hey, what's-what's going on?!
chandler Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
joey Dude! He's right there!
ross I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
chandler Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
monica I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
ross My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
monica Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
rachel Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
phoebe Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
monica_and_rachel What?!
phoebe You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
rachel Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
monica Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
phoebe What else?
monica When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
rachel Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
phoebe That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
monica When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
rachel Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
monica And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
chandler Hey.
monica She really left.
chandler I know.
monica Thank you.
chandler No problem roomie.
monica Can I ask you a question?
chandler Sure!
monica What the hell is that dog doing here?!
chandler Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
all That's so sweet.
ross And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
rachel And a crappy New Year.
chandler Here, here!
rachel You can't move. You just... you just can't.
joey Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
phoebe Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
ross You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
rachel Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
chandler Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
monica And?
chandler Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
monica We can't afford that.
chandler I know.
monica Well, there you go.
joey I'm really sorry you guys.
ross Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
rachel Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
phoebe You're gonna be okay?
monica Yeah, we'll be okay.
ross Love you guys.
joey You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
chandler That's okay, we understand.
joey And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
monica I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
chandler Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
monica What?
chandler We got the house.
monica Oh my God!
chandler I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
monica Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
chandler We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
monica And a baby...
chandler We're growing up.
monica We sure are.
chandler So who's gonna tell them?
monica Not it!
chandler Not it! Damn it!
monica Rachel, this is yours.
rachel Aah! Why? What are these for?
chandler You'll see.
monica All right, everybody open them!
rachel Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
phoebe Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
monica I know.
ross I love this.
joey A meatball Sub? Thanks!
ross Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
chandler Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
monica Enjoy!
joey What did they say?
