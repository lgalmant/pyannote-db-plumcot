ross Hey!
chandler_joey_and_phoebe Hey!
ross I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
phoebe Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
ross 15? Your personal best!
phoebe Where were you?
ross Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
chandler Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
phoebe Oh, which museum?
phoebe No, answer his.
ross Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
chandler Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
ross No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
chandler How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
joey Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
chandler Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
phoebe Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
chandler All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
rachel Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
chandler Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
rachel Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
joey Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
chandler Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
rachel Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
chandler Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
rachel Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
chandler Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
all Hey!
phoebe What's wrong Mon?
monica Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
phoebe Oh.
monica I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
phoebe Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
rachel Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
monica I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
joey Ohhh!
monica I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
rachel Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
monica I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
chandler Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
joey Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
monica That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
joey Good enough to get fired.
monica All right, you're hired!
joey Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
chandler Yes.
chandler I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
drew I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
chandler See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
drew Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
chandler Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
mike Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
chandler Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
mike Oh wow! I'm free for her!
drew Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
mike Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
drew Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
chandler Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
mike Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
chandler Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
phoebe Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
monica_rachel_and_joey Yes!
phoebe Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
rachel Pheebs, that's great!
phoebe Oh, yay!
rachel But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
phoebe I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
joey What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
phoebe All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
monica Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
rachel Oh yeah!
phoebe Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
chandler Hello, children!
all Hey!
chandler Have I got the 50 guys for you!
rachel Really?!
chandler Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
joey Sure! Where are the seats?
chandler Wherever! I've got like 20!
rachel So, will I like any of these guys?
chandler Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
rachel Chandler!
chandler Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
phoebe You work with robots!!
chandler Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
rachel Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
chandler Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
rachel Op, I like credit cards!
chandler See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
rachel Well, so what does he do?
chandler Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
rachel Your company has a fine foods division?
chandler It's a big company, I don't-if you-I
joey Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
phoebe No! No, the robots just work for them.
monica All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
joey Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
monica You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
joey Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
monica You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
ross Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
chandler Oh yeah! With who?
ross You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
chandler Yeah.
ross Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
phoebe If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
ross Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
joey Hey!
ross Hey!
chandler Hey, man!
phoebe Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
joey Damn!
joey Hey.
monica Hey.
joey Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
monica They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
joey You got it! Oh-oh!
monica What are you doing?!
joey It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
monica Thanks. I think you got it!
rachel Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
chandler Well, like father, like son.
rachel Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
chandler Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
rachel Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
chandler Ummmmmmmm, no.
rachel You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
chandler Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
rachel Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
monica Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
joey Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
a_waiter Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
joey There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
the_waiter Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
monica Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
the_waiter Because we can remember them.
monica Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
the_waiter Well, sure, that too.
monica Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere
the_waiter Can't hear you!
monica A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
joey No ma'am.
the_waiter Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
monica What the hell happened?!
joey I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
monica Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
joey And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
monica What kinda things have you been saying?
joey Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
phoebe Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry
chandler Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
phoebe What?
chandler I'm not Jewish, so
phoebe So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
chandler Bad dream?
ross I wasn't sleeping.
chandler Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
ross The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
phoebe So, did you pick one yet?
ross No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
phoebe Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
ross Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
phoebe Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
chandler Prague?
phoebe There's sooo much you don't know.
rachel Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
chandler I did! I absolutely did!
rachel You idiot!!
chandler I'm sure you're right, but why?
rachel You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
chandler Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
rachel Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
chandler I know! I know!
rachel Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
chandler Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
rachel Really?
chandler Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
rachel No.
chandler Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
rachel Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
chandler Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
rachel Well that sounds fun too.
chandler Have you ever been with a woman?
rachel What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
chandler So there is no good time to ask that question.
the_conductor The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!

monica Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
the_waiter You found that handle, did ya?
monica That's not funny.
the_waiter Well that's not true.
monica I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is
joey Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
monica You do?
joey You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
monica Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!

monica You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
the_waiter No.
monica How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
the_waiter No, it's really good.
monica Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
the_conductor Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.

ross Are we really in Montreal?!
woman_on_train Yes we are. So, coffee?
ross Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
woman_on_train Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

monica Thanks.
joey Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
monica Enough!
joey Lean-lean-lean!
phoebe "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. No, don't sing along.
