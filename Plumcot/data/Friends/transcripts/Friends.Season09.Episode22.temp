charlie Oh! That feels sooo good!
rachel Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
charlie I'm sorry, what?
rachel Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
charlie From... Cosmo??
rachel Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
charlie So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
joey So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
rachel Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
joey Oh hey Rach!
rachel Yeah...
joey Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
rachel Oh, well...
charlie I'm sure you have better things to do.
joey Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
charlie If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
rachel Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
joey Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes..... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
phoebe Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?
joey What's the matter, Pheebs?
phoebe Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
rachel Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
phoebe Exactly!
rachel And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
phoebe I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!
rachel Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
phoebe Ok, that'll be great!
joey Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
rachel That's not what we're gonna do!
joey Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
chandler Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
monica Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
chandler Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
doctor_connelly Hi there.
chandler Hi.
monica Hi.
doctor_connelly I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
monica Ok.
doctor_connelly Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
chandler Oh, DAMN IT!
monica Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
doctor_connelly Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
monica Ok.
doctor_connelly And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
chandler Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
rachel Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
charlie Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
joey Alright, have a good time.
rachel Not gonna find any clothes in there!
ross Hey, you guys!
rachel Hi.
ross Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
charlie Umh... Kurts Baley?
ross Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing?
joey Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
charlie So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
ross Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
charlie He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
ross Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
rachel Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
ross Tsz... NO!
chandler Hey guys!
ross Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
chandler I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
ross It's in Barbados.
chandler But you come first!
rachel I'm there!
charlie We'll see you, guys!
joey Bye.
rachel Bye, see ya.
chandler Ok.
joey All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
chandler Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
ross So-so what did the doctor say?
chandler Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
joey So you're ruling out surrogacy?
chandler Yeah.
joey So, I don't have to learn what that means?
chandler Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
joey Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
chandler ah-ha!
ross How do you feel about all this?
chandler I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
joey Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
ross What?
ross What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
ross The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
professor_sherman Mmm-mm.
ross I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
ross Oh, that's not what you want...
shop_assistant Incentive For Men?
phoebe Oh, I'll take some of that.
rachel Pheebs, that's for men!
phoebe No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah.
phoebe Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
charlie So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
rachel On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
charlie See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
rachel Really?
charlie Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
rachel Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
charlie You've seen all the movies...
rachel Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
phoebe Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
rachel Sure!
phoebe Ok!
charlie Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
rachel You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
phoebe So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
rachel She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
phoebe Why?
rachel I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
phoebe Who else?
rachel Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
phoebe You like Joey?
rachel Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
phoebe Oh my God!
rachel It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
phoebe Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
rachel Oh, I get it!
phoebe Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
rachel I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel So can we keep this between us?
phoebe Sure!
rachel Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
phoebe Oh.
phoebe Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
monica Hi honey!
chandler Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
monica Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
zack You too.
chandler You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
monica I got it.
zack Thanks.
chandler So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
monica Yeah, I guess.
chandler So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
monica Excuse me?
chandler Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
monica Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
chandler No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
monica Chandler!
chandler I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
monica I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
chandler Ok!
monica Uh!
chandler Zack!
zack Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
monica Tell me about yourself, Zack!
rachel Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
phoebe Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
rachel Ok, great!
rachel Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
phoebe I didn't say anything yet!
rachel Well, get back in there and talk!
phoebe I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
rachel What!?
phoebe Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
rachel Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
phoebe Ooh! We have a problem.
rachel Oh! What are we gonna do?
stranger Just be honest with her.
rachel Oh my God!
stranger And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
rachel Alright! Enough out of you!
joey Hello?
ross Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
joey No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
ross I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
joey Oh! How's it going?
ross It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
joey What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
ross Barbados.
joey Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
ross What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
joey Well, just wake him up!
ross I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
joey Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
monica Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
zack Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks!
chandler So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
monica Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
chandler You don't like him.
monica I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
chandler Alright! Just follow my lead!
zack You guys have such a great place here.
chandler Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
zack Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
chandler That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
zack Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
monica Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
zack No...
monica Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
zack You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
monica We're just making conversation.
zack Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
chandler You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness
zack Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
monica_chandler Sure! Alright...
zack Ravioli's delicious!
chandler I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
zack No I didn't.
monica Yess!!
chandler We're teeth people Zack!
rachel Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
phoebe Good plan.
rachel Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
phoebe Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
rachel Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
charlie Oh! trying on clothes.
rachel Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
charlie Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
rachel Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
charlie No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
rachel Yeah.
charlie It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
rachel Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
charlie Wow!
rachel Yeah...
charlie You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
rachel I try...
ross Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!
prof_sherman You're welcome.
joey Wow! You look..... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
phoebe Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
joey Then don't go!
phoebe Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
joey Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
phoebe You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
phoebe David?
david Phoebe! Hi!
phoebe Oh my God!
david Wow, you look unbelievable.
phoebe Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
david Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
phoebe What happened?
david Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
phoebe Yeah?
david Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
phoebe Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
david Good, good, life is good...
phoebe Good!
david Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
phoebe Oh, good for you.
david She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
phoebe Mike and I broke up.
david You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
phoebe Really?
david Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
phoebe I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
david Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
phoebe Well... no.
david Do you wanna get a drink?
phoebe I'd love to.
david Great.
phoebe Ok.
david Do you smell beets?
phoebe Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
charlie Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
rachel No, that's David.
charlie There's a third guy?
rachel Tip of the iceberg.
zack I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
chandler You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
zack No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
chandler Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
zack No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
chandler Ok.
chandler I think we've found our sperm!
monica Does seem pretty perfect.
chandler Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
monica No.
chandler Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
monica No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
chandler Yeah, he's better!
monica No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
chandler Really? Are you sure?
monica Yeah, I'm sure.
chandler Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
monica That is so sweet. I love you.
chandler So you know this leaves us with...
monica Adoption.
chandler How do you feel about that?
monica I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
chandler Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
monica So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
chandler Yeah.
monica Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
chandler We are gonna be great parents.
monica And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
chandler Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
chandler Hey, Zack!
zack Hey Chandler.
chandler Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
zack No you didn't.
chandler Really?
zack No you did.
chandler My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
jeanette Here are the boards for Friday's pitch
zack Oh, thank you.
chandler You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
