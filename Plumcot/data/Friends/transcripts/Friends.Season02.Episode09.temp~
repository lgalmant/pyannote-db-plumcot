phoebe Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
rachel Hey.
joey Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
chandler Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
monica Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
chandler And twenty-five it is.
joey You gave him cookies?
monica Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
phoebe I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
chandler Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
phoebe Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
ross So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
rachel Uhh, the mailman, the super.
monica Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
joey Oh my God.
rachel What?
joey Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
rachel Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
monica Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
ross Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
joey I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
chandler Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
ross Hey guys.
ross Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh.
rachel Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
ross How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
gunther Yeah.
ross Here, go nuts.
ross Hey guys.
chandler What's in the bag?
ross Um, just some presents.
joey C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
ross OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
monica Cute.
ross I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
monica Ross, that is gorgeous!
ross Yeah?
monica Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
phoebe Hey.
gang Hey. Hi Phoebe.
phoebe Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
ross Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
phoebe This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
chandler Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
phoebe No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
rachel Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
phoebe No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
rachel How have you never been on Oprah?
phoebe OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
monica Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
phoebe It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
monica Oh, wait a minute honey.
gang Phoebs.
monica Wow.
joey So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
gang Joey!
joey Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
grandmother Esther Livingston. Gone.
grandmother Hi, Phoe.
phoebe Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
grandmother Oh, just updating the phonebook.
phoebe Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
grandmother Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
phoebe Just, you know, to see... um.
grandmother Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
phoebe OK, is this really my father?
grandmother Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
phoebe OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
grandmother Look, I. . .
phoebe Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
grandmother Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
phoebe Oh God.
grandmother It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
phoebe Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
grandmother Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
phoebe OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
grandmother Honey.
phoebe Oh.
grandmother Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
phoebe Oh.
chandler Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
rachel Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
chandler Who said anything about Christmas?
monica Hi.
ross Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
rachel No, nothin'.
monica I hope she's OK.
joey Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
monica How do you know exactly what she's going through?
joey She told us.
chandler So whaddya got there Monica?
monica Just some stuff for the party.
ross Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
monica You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
chandler Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
rachel Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
monica Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
joey Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
