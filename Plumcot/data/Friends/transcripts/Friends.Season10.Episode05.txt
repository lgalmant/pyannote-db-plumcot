rachel_green You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
joey_tribbiani Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
rachel_green I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
joey_tribbiani No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
monica_geller Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
rachel_green Of course, I'd be honored!
chandler_bing Thanks!
monica_geller Thank you!
joey_tribbiani U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
chandler_bing Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
monica_geller Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
joey_tribbiani Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
monica_geller Clearly we were wrong.
joey_tribbiani I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
monica_geller You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
joey_tribbiani Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
chandler_bing So excited about your letter!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
all@ Hey Phoebe!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Wow! Don't you look nice?!
phoebe_buffay Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
rachel_green OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
phoebe_buffay YEAH!
chandler_bing So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
phoebe_buffay Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
joey_tribbiani Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
phoebe_buffay Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
monica_geller You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
chandler_bing That's where people make number two!!
charlie_wheeler Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey...
charlie_wheeler So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
dr_ross_geller Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
charlie_wheeler Fine, it's fine... I'll just shower by myself...
dr_ross_geller B, B, B, B, B!
charlie_wheeler Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
dr_ross_geller Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
dr_ross_geller Damnit!
amy_green Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! I have to talk to you!!
dr_ross_geller Hi Amy!
amy_green You're not Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Still sharp as a tack!
amy_green Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
charlie_wheeler Hi!
amy_green Hi!
charlie_wheeler Nice to meet you.
amy_green H-Hi!! And you are...?
dr_ross_geller Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
amy_green N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes, you did.
dr_ross_geller Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
rachel_green Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
amy_green Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
joey_tribbiani That's right, yeah.
amy_green You're not good!
joey_tribbiani Always nice to meet a fan!
rachel_green So now, what are you doing here?
amy_green Well, I have huge news.
rachel_green Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
amy_green Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
dr_ross_geller Ehm... Her name is Emma.
amy_green Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
dr_ross_geller What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
amy_green Hey, your English is getting better!!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
dr_ross_geller What... what you working on?
joey_tribbiani Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
dr_ross_geller Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
joey_tribbiani What did I just say?
dr_ross_geller Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
rachel_green God!
amy_green So beautiful.
rachel_green Oh, I know, isn't she?
amy_green No, I was talking about your bedding.
rachel_green All right. What's your news, Amy?
amy_green Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
rachel_green What? Oh my God! To who?
amy_green This guy! He has a killer apartment.
rachel_green A-And??
amy_green A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
rachel_green No, what's he like?
amy_green Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
rachel_green Yeah.
amy_green It's his dad.
rachel_green Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
amy_green Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
rachel_green Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
amy_green Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
rachel_green Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
amy_green Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
rachel_green Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
amy_green You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!
rachel_green Ok.
amy_green I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
rachel_green Ok, let's keep talking.
phoebe_buffay Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they're in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! Can't believe it's been a whole year!
mike_hannigan I know. This has been the best year... THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
phoebe_buffay ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
mike_hannigan I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
phoebe_buffay YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
announcer#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode05 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
phoebe_buffay Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.
mike_hannigan Really?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's the worst way to propose!
mike_hannigan Excuse me...
joey_tribbiani Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
chandler_bing I don't... uh... understand.
joey_tribbiani Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
monica_geller It doesn't make any sense.
joey_tribbiani Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
chandler_bing On every word?
joey_tribbiani Yep!
monica_geller Alright, what was this sentence originally?
joey_tribbiani Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
chandler_bing And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
monica_geller Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
monica_geller Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
chandler_bing You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
rachel_green Amy, hi!
amy_green I took your advice, I left Myron.
rachel_green Oh, good for you!
amy_green I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
rachel_green Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
amy_green Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
rachel_green But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
joey_tribbiani Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
amy_green Well, I'm staying with you guys!
joey_tribbiani What?
amy_green We're gonna be roomies! Come on!
joey_tribbiani You slept out here?
rachel_green Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'
joey_tribbiani But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
rachel_green Joey, I can't do that!
joey_tribbiani Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
rachel_green Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
joey_tribbiani 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
rachel_green No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, Monica made us!
rachel_green Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
amy_green Good morning.
joey_tribbiani Yeaah.
rachel_green Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
amy_green Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
rachel_green Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
amy_green Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
joey_tribbiani I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
phoebe_buffay Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
chandler_bing I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
monica_geller Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
dr_ross_geller Seriously?
chandler_bing Word!
phoebe_buffay Well, mine was worse than that.
rachel_green Well, what happened?
phoebe_buffay We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
rachel_green Oh, that is so tacky.
phoebe_buffay Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
monica_geller Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
rachel_green Phoebe, that's huge!
dr_ross_geller Well, do you wanna marry him?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
chandler_bing She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
monica_geller Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
monica_geller I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
chandler_bing Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
monica_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Well, do you think I should propose?
rachel_green I think it could be kind of great!
dr_ross_geller Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
phoebe_buffay Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
monica_geller How about at a game, on the big screen?
rachel_green Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
monica_geller What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
chandler_bing Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
amy_green Nana is on the phone
rachel_green Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
amy_green She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
rachel_green Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
dr_ross_geller No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
rachel_green Menstrual cramps.
dr_ross_geller I don't think that's what this is.
rachel_green Can any of you watch Emma?
monica_geller No, sorry sweety..
phoebe_buffay No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
rachel_green Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
amy_green Well, I can do it.
rachel_green Well, actually...
dr_ross_geller Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
rachel_green Why not?
dr_ross_geller Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella! Rachel: Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
dr_ross_geller Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
rachel_green Wha... the next one?
dr_ross_geller Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
rachel_green Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
dr_ross_geller I... I don't know..
rachel_green Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
amy_green um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me...
rachel_green Absolutely.
amy_green Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
chandler_bing Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
joey_tribbiani Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
monica_geller You dropped it off?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
joey_tribbiani No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
monica_geller You hand-wrote it?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
monica_geller Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
chandler_bing It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
monica_geller Okay good.
chandler_bing Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye.
monica_geller Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
chandler_bing They loved it.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
monica_geller They thought Joey was a child?
chandler_bing She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
amy_green Hi!
monica_geller Hey, what did you guys do today?
amy_green Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
chandler_bing That sounds like fun.
amy_green Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
rachel_green Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
amy_green I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
rachel_green Yeah!
amy_green Ta-daaa!
rachel_green You pierced her ears!?
amy_green Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
rachel_green You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
amy_green Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
chandler_bing I think she looks cute.. but I am wrong!
rachel_green Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
amy_green Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
rachel_green Ugh.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys. Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.
rachel_green Nah, I don't really want her to see.
dr_ross_geller Why not?
monica_geller Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
chandler_bing Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
dr_ross_geller Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Nothing.
dr_ross_geller Hi! What... Please tell me those are clip-ons.
rachel_green Oh, they're real!
dr_ross_geller Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
rachel_green I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
amy_green Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
monica_geller I'm a cool, fun aunt!
amy_green O-Okay!
chandler_bing Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
rachel_green I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
amy_green Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
rachel_green Oh yeah? Since when?
amy_green Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller That's not a thing!
amy_green Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
rachel_green Babies don't care if they're slim.
amy_green Enter Amy!
dr_ross_geller Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
amy_green What? What are you gonna do?
dr_ross_geller No more falafel for you!
mike_hannigan Great game, huh?
phoebe_buffay Uhuh, uhuh...
mike_hannigan Why do you keep looking at the screen?
phoebe_buffay I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
mike_hannigan Going go to the bathroom.
phoebe_buffay Well, I think you should wait.
mike_hannigan Why?
phoebe_buffay Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
announcer#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode05 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
phoebe_buffay Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
announcer#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode05 Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
phoebe_buffay That's not very enlightened!
phoebe_buffay Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
joey_tribbiani Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
rachel_green Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
joey_tribbiani Whoo-hoo!
amy_green You're kicking me out?
rachel_green You put holes in my baby's ears!
amy_green Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
rachel_green I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
amy_green You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
rachel_green Excuse me?
amy_green You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?
rachel_green Joey, where are those bags?
joey_tribbiani She has a lot of crap!
amy_green You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
rachel_green Seriously?
amy_green hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
rachel_green Hips or thighs?
amy_green Ass and face.
rachel_green Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
amy_green She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
rachel_green Oh, I can give you that.
amy_green You can?
rachel_green Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
amy_green Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
rachel_green Did you just say Emma?
amy_green Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
phoebe_buffay That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
mike_hannigan But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
phoebe_buffay I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
phoebe_buffay It's in the cake, isn't it?
mike_hannigan Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
phoebe_buffay What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
mike_hannigan No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
mike_hannigan I'm gonna do this now.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
mike_hannigan Phoebe, I...
phoebe_buffay Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
mike_hannigan Ready?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh!
mike_hannigan Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
phoebe_buffay Yes!
mike_hannigan I love you!
phoebe_buffay I love you more!
mike_hannigan Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
rachel_green So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
amy_green Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
rachel_green That's shocking!
amy_green Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! Hello-oo Ross! He's rude!
