joey_tribbiani All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
rachel_green Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
joey_tribbiani Just flip!
rachel_green Ha, tails!
joey_tribbiani Damnit!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
rachel_green Oh, that sounds good!
monica_geller Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
rachel_green It's all done!
monica_geller Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
rachel_green I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
monica_geller Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
rachel_green Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
monica_geller Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
chandler_bing Where's your passport?
rachel_green It should be right next to my plane ticket.
chandler_bing Well, it's not.
rachel_green What? Maybe I put it in here Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
monica_geller Here, let me help you.
rachel_green Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
chandler_bing At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
monica_geller Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
erica I know.
monica_geller You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
erica No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
erica Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
erica That's because I'm pregnant!
dr_ross_geller Right, no, I understand.
erica Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
dr_ross_geller No, no, I knew
monica_geller Okay, well, stop staring at them.
dr_ross_geller She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
erica Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
monica_geller Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
dr_ross_geller Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
monica_geller Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
erica Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
dr_ross_geller Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
monica_geller Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
erica I'll be right back.
dr_ross_geller Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
monica_geller Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
dr_ross_geller No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
monica_geller Yeah, it takes two incomes.
dr_ross_geller Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
monica_geller Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
dr_ross_geller Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
monica_geller Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
dr_ross_geller What are you guys doing?
joey_tribbiani Try it, I can't feel a thing!
monica_geller Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
chandler_bing We're taking a break!
monica_geller From?
chandler_bing Jumping on the bed?
monica_geller All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
dr_ross_geller You got it! All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
chandler_bing No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
joey_tribbiani You guys hear a ringing?
chandler_bing What the hell is this?
joey_tribbiani Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
dr_ross_geller Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
chandler_bing I didn't know Monica had these!
joey_tribbiani Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
chandler_bing Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
dr_ross_geller Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey! Where's Mike?
phoebe_buffay Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
phoebe_buffay Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
dr_ross_geller Rock on!
phoebe_buffay Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
monica_geller Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey, where's Rach?
joey_tribbiani Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
dr_ross_geller Great.
joey_tribbiani Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
monica_geller Yeah.
everybody#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode16 Hey Rach, hey you.
dr_ross_geller Here she is!
rachel_green Hi you guys!
joey_tribbiani What did I just say?
rachel_green No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
monica_geller Come here, I'll make you a drink.
dr_ross_geller Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
chandler_bing I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
joey_tribbiani You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
chandler_bing Yes, Joe?
joey_tribbiani I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
phoebe_buffay You doing ok?
rachel_green Well, I've been better.
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm.
rachel_green You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
phoebe_buffay Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
rachel_green I'm gonna miss you so much.
phoebe_buffay I know.
rachel_green You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here
dr_ross_geller Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
joey_tribbiani Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
rachel_green Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
phoebe_buffay Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
rachel_green Oh, oh. What is this?
phoebe_buffay It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
rachel_green I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
monica_geller Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
chandler_bing Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
monica_geller What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
monica_geller That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
chandler_bing Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
monica_geller Rachel used to live in that room.
chandler_bing Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
monica_geller Joey's bare ass!
chandler_bing Well played.
rachel_green I love you Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
rachel_green All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
phoebe_buffay Ok.
rachel_green Ok. Monica?
monica_geller Yeah?
rachel_green Can you come here with me for a minute?
monica_geller Sure.
phoebe_buffay Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
monica_geller No.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're so screwed.
dr_ross_geller Hey. What was that all about?
phoebe_buffay She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding? Oh my God...
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
dr_ross_geller Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
rachel_green Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
monica_geller I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
rachel_green I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
monica_geller You're the best friend I ever had.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green I... I... I...
monica_geller That is so sweet.
dr_ross_geller Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
chandler_bing Uh, Rach?
dr_ross_geller Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
joey_tribbiani I really made you think about that thing uh?
chandler_bing Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
chandler_bing No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
rachel_green Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
chandler_bing Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
rachel_green Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
chandler_bing Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
chandler_bing I think these are yours.
phoebe_buffay These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
rachel_green Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
chandler_bing Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
phoebe_buffay Where do you think Mike really is?
rachel_green Oh honey...
chandler_bing Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
rachel_green Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
chandler_bing Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
rachel_green Okay. Oh...
rachel_green Oh!
chandler_bing I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
monica_geller So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
dr_ross_geller I don't think so.
chandler_bing Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
monica_geller You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
chandler_bing That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
dr_ross_geller God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
all@ No, no, no, no!
dr_ross_geller Okay, here we go...
rachel_green Oh... Well...
dr_ross_geller Yeah...
rachel_green I think I'm gonna take off.
dr_ross_geller Huh?
rachel_green Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
dr_ross_geller What? I don't get a goodbye?
joey_tribbiani Lucky bastard!
dr_ross_geller Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
monica_geller Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
dr_ross_geller Well, it needs to be plicit.
joey_tribbiani All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
dr_ross_geller No, I don't think so.
phoebe_buffay You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
monica_geller Yeah. Mine too.
chandler_bing Mine was a humdinger
dr_ross_geller O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
phoebe_buffay Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
monica_geller And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
dr_ross_geller THE HELL I DO!
dr_ross_geller I don't get a goodbye?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
rachel_green Ross...
dr_ross_geller Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
monica_geller I hope Ross isn't too upset.
joey_tribbiani I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
phoebe_buffay Tell me about it.
chandler_bing Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
phoebe_buffay All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
monica_geller Uh, where do you think you're going?
phoebe_buffay I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
monica_geller We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
chandler_bing Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
monica_geller Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
chandler_bing You couldn't be cool.
monica_geller Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
chandler_bing Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
monica_geller You did? How?
chandler_bing Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
monica_geller Oh my God! Let me see.
joey_tribbiani Who's that dirty old lady?
chandler_bing Monica's grandmother.
monica_geller Nana liked it rough!
erica Hi!
all@ Hey!
joey_tribbiani Come on here, have a seat.
phoebe_buffay How was your night?
erica Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
monica_geller Erica, are you okay?
erica Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
monica_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing Relax! We just get her some antacids.
monica_geller She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
monica_geller All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
chandler_bing Honey, it's gonna be okay.
erica You can do this. Just breathe.
monica_geller Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
erica Ooh! Are you sure?
monica_geller Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
joey_tribbiani Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
rachel_green You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
dr_ross_geller That's what it seemed like.
rachel_green I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
dr_ross_geller Fine, then why didn't you say something?
rachel_green Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
dr_ross_geller Rach!
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller You keep, you keep... You can't...
rachel_green WHAT?
joey_tribbiani A little more.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
joey_tribbiani A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
phoebe_buffay All right, ready?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
phoebe_buffay All right, here it goes...
joey_tribbiani Doesn't work...
