joey_tribbiani Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don't really know what happened with that.
phoebe_abbott_sr I'm your mother.
phoebe_buffay Ehh?
joey_tribbiani Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler...
chandler_bing Hi there.
joey_tribbiani ..and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either.
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either...
joey_tribbiani Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
dr_ross_geller Hi!
bonnie@rachel_green Hi!
bonnie Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
dr_ross_geller Awww.
bonnie Thanks a million.
rachel_green Oh, you're welcome a million.
bonnie Okay, I'll see you in our room.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller I know.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I gotta go.
rachel_green Whoa! What?! Why?!
dr_ross_geller Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
rachel_green Here?! Now?!
dr_ross_geller Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
rachel_green Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
dr_ross_geller No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
rachel_green Whoa-ho.
dr_ross_geller Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
rachel_green I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
rachel_green Oh, making it worse!
dr_ross_geller Okay.
phoebe_abbott_sr So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
phoebe_buffay I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
phoebe_abbott_sr Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
phoebe_buffay How close?
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
phoebe_buffay I don't even know how that would work!
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, we were...
phoebe_buffay I'm not asking!
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
phoebe_abbott_sr Wait!
phoebe_buffay I don't ever want to see you again!
phoebe_buffay Umm, where's my purse?
monica_geller Shoot! We're out of soda.
chandler_bing Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
monica_geller Really?!
chandler_bing Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
phoebe_buffay Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
chandler_bing I found a dried up seashores.
monica_geller Sweety, what are you talking about?
phoebe_buffay Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
joey_tribbiani Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
phoebe_buffay No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
phoebe_buffay Monica!
monica_geller Oh.
dr_ross_geller It's over.
rachel_green Oh, was it awful?
dr_ross_geller Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
rachel_green I wrote you a letter.
dr_ross_geller Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
rachel_green It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
rachel_green Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Oh-oh.
rachel_green Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
dr_ross_geller Done!
rachel_green You just finished?
dr_ross_geller Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
rachel_green So umm, does it?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry.
rachel_green Does it?
dr_ross_geller Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
rachel_green What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
dr_ross_geller No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
rachel_green Are you sure?
dr_ross_geller Oh, sure! I'm sure.
rachel_green I know.
chandler_bing All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
monica_geller Ennnh.
chandler_bing I've got canned goods.
joey_tribbiani Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
chandler_bing Excellent hole, Joe.
joey_tribbiani Oh no! No!! My hole!!
monica_geller Ow!! Ow!!!
joey_tribbiani What?! What?!! What is it?!
monica_geller Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
chandler_bing Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
monica_geller It's like two miles!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
monica_geller Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
chandler_bing We've got to do something!
joey_tribbiani Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
monica_geller What?! What is it?!
joey_tribbiani You're gonna have to pee on it.
monica_geller What?!! Gross!!
joey_tribbiani Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
chandler_bing Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
monica_geller Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
joey_tribbiani If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green How was the beach?
monica_geller Nothing, I don't know.
dr_ross_geller What happened?
monica_geller Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
chandler_bing Me too!!
joey_tribbiani Me too.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
rachel_green Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
dr_ross_geller It does. It really and truly does.
dr_ross_geller It so does not!!!
dr_ross_geller She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
chandler_bing Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
dr_ross_geller Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
joey_tribbiani No?
chandler_bing Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
joey_tribbiani Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
dr_ross_geller What the hell happened on that beach?!
joey_tribbiani It's between us and the sea, Ross!
phoebe_buffay Hi, Ursula.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 Hey!
phoebe_buffay Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
phoebe_buffay You know her?!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
phoebe_buffay There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 Hang on.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 Yeah. So how have you been doing?
phoebe_buffay I, umm, shut up!
phoebe_buffay "Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
phoebe_buffay Noooo!!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode01 All right, hang on!
monica_geller Pass the cheese, please.
monica_geller My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
joey_tribbiani Nope.
chandler_bing Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
phoebe_buffay No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
chandler_bing I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@monica_geller NO!!!
rachel_green All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
monica_geller What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Come on!
dr_ross_geller What happened? Joey?
joey_tribbiani All right.
monica_geller No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
chandler_bing They'll never understand!
joey_tribbiani Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
monica_geller All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
chandler_bing We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
monica_geller I was in too much pain.
joey_tribbiani And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
chandler_bing And then Joey remembered something.
joey_tribbiani I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Ewwww!!
monica_geller You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
dr_ross_geller@phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Ewwww!!
joey_tribbiani That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
chandler_bing Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
joey_tribbiani That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
phoebe_buffay "...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
phoebe_abbott_sr I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
phoebe_buffay Okay, bye.
phoebe_abbott_sr No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
phoebe_buffay No.
phoebe_abbott_sr Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
phoebe_buffay But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
phoebe_abbott_sr Yeah, I guess you're right.
phoebe_buffay It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
phoebe_abbott_sr Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
phoebe_buffay I-I like pizza!
phoebe_abbott_sr You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, so do I!
phoebe_abbott_sr I knew it, wow!!
phoebe_buffay Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
phoebe_abbott_sr Ohh, so cute.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
phoebe_abbott_sr I know. I'm mad at me too.
phoebe_buffay Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
phoebe_abbott_sr Hey! Me too!
phoebe_buffay All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
rachel_green Oh-hooo, I missed you.
dr_ross_geller I missed you too.
rachel_green Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
dr_ross_geller I suppose.
rachel_green You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
dr_ross_geller Umm-hmm.
rachel_green Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
dr_ross_geller WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
chandler_bing Coffee house?
monica_geller You bet.
dr_ross_geller And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
rachel_green Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
dr_ross_geller I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
rachel_green What?!!
dr_ross_geller I fell asleep!
rachel_green You fell asleep?!
dr_ross_geller It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
rachel_green Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
dr_ross_geller FINE BY ME!!
rachel_green Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
monica_geller Hey!!
rachel_green Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
dr_ross_geller Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
rachel_green And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
chandler_bing I KNEW IT!!!!
monica_geller Gin.
chandler_bing We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
monica_geller Will you stop!
chandler_bing Okay. All right.
monica_geller Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
