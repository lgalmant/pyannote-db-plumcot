conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 It's a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys, talk down the episode umm... The point of this whole thing is what people see in America is: they see Friends, they love the show, it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes there's deceit, mistrust, and hate. And I thought, I thought we'd actually take a look at uh, y'know some of these moments where you guys are-there are mistakes. You make mistakes.
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Once and a while.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 From time to time.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 For example, I don't have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Our energy just comes way up when there's an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn't, it just doesn't work.
dr_ross_geller Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn't. I did.
chandler_bing Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.
phoebe_buffay So, we realize that-Oh no... I'm telling it! I'm telling it
joey_tribbiani Ha-ha. Look-Come on, I don't know what to do...or say.
joey_tribbiani Ha-ha, very funny. I don't know what to do! Y'know? Holy crud!
joey_tribbiani Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don't know what to do!
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 It is one of those days!
phoebe_buffay 'Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay--uck it!
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You still get nervous everybody just before a show?
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Absolutely.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Everybody.
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 It's amazing like all week long we've-we've been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once, then you'll get nervous because you'll-you know you'll probably mess up again.
the_director Action!
monica_geller When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.
the_director Watch again that hand.
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 This'll be five/ten takes.
the_director Okay.
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay. You know it's gonna happen.
the_director Once again, and action!
monica_geller When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon.
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Oh! Okay! I'm gonna try it without the coffee cup 'cause I think it's the left hand that's messing me up.
monica_geller When you were little you slept through the Grand--Oh fffff....
monica_geller Sorry, let's go back! 'Cause you've got more to say.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that's your fault. I...say.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I love you.
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I love you!
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 But there must be, there must-are a lot of moments over the years where you're just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.
joey_tribbiani Hey and, this is a little extra something for y'know, always being there for me.
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 What?!
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Ahh! Sh--it that hurt!
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Are you okay?
chandler_bing Hey Rach!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? Then how come I keep-
monica_geller It was so wild! We told 'em we were the Gunderson's in 16
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I spit on her!
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Operation. You had a fun one.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Oh yeah!
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 With Operation.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.
phoebe_buffay Oh-ooh, and I brought Operation, but umm I lost the umm... It's making a noise.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 But le Blanc really doesn't mess up much.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You don't verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call 'em.
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he--he was afraid he was gonna fall down
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! Check it out!
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 This particular time when he continued to fall or y'know, try not to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?"
joey_tribbiani Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something's naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I don't necessarily like to juice things
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 He said true or false!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Ooh-ooh!
monica_geller What are you doing?!
joey_tribbiani You're still a tiny bit on fire there.
monica_geller Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
richard_crosby It was great seeing you the other night.
monica_geller Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
richard_crosby Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
chandler_bing What the fu--ck are you doing?!
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a monkey
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 That damn monkey.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 That damn monkey.
rachel_green Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That's Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There--Okay.
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here-Katie! Katie, come here Katie. Very good.
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Lisa's laugh though...There's-It's so infectious. It's one of those things...just forget about it. Once it starts, it's all gone.
rachel_green No y'know, I don't want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
phoebe_buffay Well at Monica's you can eat-
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay, shh yeah. 'Cause it's not silly.
the_director Here we go.
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay.
the_director And...action!
rachel_green No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Ready?
lisa#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 And then it just builds on itself and there's no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when-I mean when
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You bastard.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah, what did I do?
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 ...I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I-I mean I find it so funny.
joey_tribbiani Mornin'
dr_ross_geller Mornin'
joey_tribbiani I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 That's a good one?
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Now, we should go back and take the other line.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay, I'll just put a little more booze on there.
dr_ross_geller I think, subconsciously
joey_tribbiani Nope, you lost me.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 No! Come on!
joey_tribbiani Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. I'll be Monica. Go!
dr_ross_geller No! No! No!
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 We'll be right back with more Friends, less me.
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I'm doing my brother.
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 That's...gross.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You uh, you've worked with-They always say a performer should never work with pets or children.
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Aww, the kids.
the_director Action.
rachel_green Okay. Now-What is my first line?
ben#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 What did we agree?
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 The good thing about the young kids though, they're completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Oh little Ben.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to hear my son's first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn't supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show
dr_ross_geller Hi! We're visiting!
rachel_green Yay!
dr_ross_geller It's Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
ben#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Da...Da.
dr_ross_geller Can you say Da-Da? See, I'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try
ben#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Da...Da.
dr_ross_geller Huh?
ben#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Da...Da.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah, he's saying Da-Da.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 And then sometimes during the show y'know but you're like, the scene's going one way but you're just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monica's baking cookies in our old apartment?
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 She's trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah, she's trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and we're sitting there eating pizza and I think it was you that said
phoebe_buffay What do I smell?
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I think I was supposed to say, "I don't know," and go over and open the door. And I went
phoebe_buffay What do I smell?
joey_tribbiani Sorry.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 And then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face.
phoebe_buffay What do I smell?
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Le Blanc.
phoebe_buffay What do I smell?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, but it smells good.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 But audiences-You have a live studio audience and they must love that. They must love it when they see you guys playing.
chandler_bing What are you guys doing?
dr_ross_geller Nothing.
joey_tribbiani Nothin'.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 So that you will intentionally do something that-they'll-they'll intentionally screw it up?
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah!
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah!
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Why? What's the matter?
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You-you've worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot of people love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I'm melting!
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 They made me dance, in the fat suit.
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes there's just a word that someone has to say that you'll get hung up on. And it'll just-the way you say the word is funny to everybody else.
dr_ross_geller That tastes like feet!
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 It tastes like feet!
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay, we're good.
the_director Action!
dr_ross_geller That tastes like feet!
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you'll-we'll be rehearsing during the week and you just-whatever-whatever the joke is; it's so funny we can't get through it in rehearsal and just
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You just know.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night, I'm just-I'll never be able to get through this."
monica_geller Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
chandler_bing You see, I don't say-
phoebe_buffay Oh, sweet Je--sus! Oh! Monica, these are the cookies they serve in hell!
chandler_bing Whoa! She's purty!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, and she's really nice too! She taught me about y'know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
monica_geller Joey?
rachel_green I'm sorry
dr_ross_geller Excuse me, what?
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair-a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably...I-I think it was the hardest I've-I've laughed in my life period.
dr_ross_geller Pivot! Pivot! Okay, pivot! Piv-at!
dr_ross_geller Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
chandler_bing Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Pivat!! Pivat!!!
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 You've done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now you'll be thinking about?
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 It is when we're able to crack each other up.
chandler_bing Monica's gotta have the phone in the right place and-
dr_ross_geller All right! All right! All right! We are fixing it.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 He's gone. He's
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other's performance, and we like each other.
dr_ross_geller Oh the band's ready! And well-I-I-we gotta do what the band says, right? I don't care about the stinkin' band!!
conan#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it.
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Well thank you so much.
jennifer#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Thank you Conan!
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Well thank for coming here, it's good to see you.
phoebe_buffay Thank you my babies.
monica_geller Oh what are doing?!
joey_tribbiani You're still a tiny bit on fire there!
monica_geller I think you got it!
courtney#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I'm sorry, I messed up.
matt#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 I'll do it again and again if you want.
dr_ross_geller No-no! I'll-I'll
david#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 That is too much!
matthew#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode24 Let me start that again.
