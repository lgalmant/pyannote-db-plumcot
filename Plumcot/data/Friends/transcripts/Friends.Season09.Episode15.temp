chandler Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what...
joey Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
monica Really? Let's get past the moment.
phoebe What's your news?
chandler Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
monica Oh, honey, that's incredible!
phoebe Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
chandler Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
joey Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
chandler Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.
ross So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
chandler Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
phoebe That's great.
chandler Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
chandler Humiliating and noble!
ross You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
monica Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
ross Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!
joey Hey!
monica Hey!
joey Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.. and I smelled bacon.
monica He just left.
joey Who did?
rachel Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
joey She did?
rachel You got it!
joey I did?
monica What is she talking about?
joey I don't know, but it sounds great.
rachel Your agent called. You got that audition.
joey With Lennart Haze?
rachel Yes.
joey Oh my god, that is great! That is ''' for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
monica Is it a good play?
joey Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.
rachel Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it...
joey Yeah, yeah, and directing.
monica He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
rachel You saw that?
monica No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
rachel_and_joey Ah!
joey Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
rachel Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
joey I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
monica Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
joey Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
chandler Good morning, everybody.
intern Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
chandler Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.
intern Seriously, you're an intern?
chandler Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
intern Dude!
chandler Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope
chandler The comedian? USO?!
intern Uhm, it's USA, sir.
receptionist This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.
joey It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
lennart Well, I've... I've been blessed with a... a lot of great roles.
joey Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"
lennart You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
joey No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
lennart Really?
joey Yeah.
lennart Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.
joey Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon...
lennart Peeeeeooooooooch "Hang up that phone!" One take!
joey Wow!
lennart So, shall we read?
joey Oh, yah, sure.
lennart Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?
lennart "What the hell are you still doing here"?
joey Err, "I think you know".
lennart "Bastard"!
joey "I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
lennart "Go, go!"
joey "I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
lennart I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"
joey Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...
lennart No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.
joey Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern "I could go right now, maaan!"
lennart My god in heaven.
producer_1 Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?
lennart You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act.
lennart Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.
joey Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
lennart Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?
joey Yeah.
lennart Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.
joey I really doubt that.
lennart No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.
joey Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
phoebe Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
ross Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
phoebe Oh, I hear divorce bells.
mugger Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
ross What?
mugger I have a gun
ross O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
mugger Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
phoebe No.
ross What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe Lowell, is that you?
lowell Phoebe? Oh my god!
phoebe Oh my god!
phoebe I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.
lowell Ross, nice to meet you.
ross Yeah, a real pleasure.
phoebe Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!
lowell Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
phoebe Good for you!
lowell So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
phoebe Ouh...
ross Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
phoebe Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up...
monica Hey, how did the audition go?
joey Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
monica What happened?
joey Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
monica So far so good!
chandler Honey, I'm old!
monica What's wrong?
chandler I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
monica So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
chandler Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
joey Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
monica What are they?
chandler They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
joey I give you $ 500 for them!
chandler What am I supposed to do with these?
monica Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
chandler Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?
monica Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
chandler No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
joey Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
all Hey, hey!
ross Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!
monica You okay?!
ross Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
monica How do you know a mugger?
phoebe I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
ross You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.
monica Seriously?
phoebe Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I...
monica Phoebe, that is awful!
phoebe Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer...
monica You're mother killed herself!
phoebe She was a drug dealer!
ross Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!
phoebe Okay...
monica Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
phoebe Why?
monica Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
phoebe You were?
ross Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
monica Wonderwoman!
ross Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone.... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"
phoebe Oh my god...
ross I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
monica Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
ross A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
monica That's it.
ross Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
phoebe No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.
phoebe Okay, I think we have a problem here.
monica What?
phoebe Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
monica Yeah?
phoebe Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
monica So?
phoebe Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
phoebe_and_monica "Geology rocks!"
monica Oh my god!
phoebe I know... I mugged Ross!
receptionist You're late!
joey I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
receptionist No, Lennart doesn't wait!
joey But I'm bursting with u-hu!
lennart Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
joey Actually, I really need...
lennart We must go now, quickly, please.
joey Yes... ahahaaa
lennart Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"
joey "I think you know!"
lennart "Oh, you sick bastard!"
joey "I am what you made me! You know what?"
lennart "What?"
joey "I could go right now."
lennart "Then go, go!"
joey "I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
lennart Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
joey I did?
lennart Yes. Plus... what you've got that... I don't know what you've got going... this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ''', do all of this what you've got going now, but - you know what? - more, more. Can you do that?
joey Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
lennart Look at that: still in character, I like it... I plant seeds I can't explain.
monica Hey!
chandler Hey!
monica What are you doing?
chandler Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything...
rachel Oh, anything yet?
chandler Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
joey Hey!
all Hey!
joey Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
monica No, that seems about right.
joey Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
rachel Joey, that was formula.
joey We gotta get more of that.
chandler You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
rachel Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
chandler Alright I feel youger already!
chandler Yah, I think I broke my hip.
phoebe Hey, you!
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey, how was class?
ross No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
phoebe Nothing, I really wanna know.
ross Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene...
phoebe Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid...
ross Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
phoebe You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
ross No, it wasn't.
phoebe Yes, it was.
ross No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old...
phoebe "Gimme your money, punk!"
ross Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?
phoebe Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!
ross It's not the best!
phoebe I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say...
ross There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
phoebe Really? Even more humiliating than...
ross Hey, let's not do this!
intern .. and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!
boss That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander...
chandler Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age...
intern Your age?
chandler A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
boss Chandler, that's great!
chandler Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me
boss You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's.... You did you come up with that?
chandler I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
boss That is great. Good work!
boss See all of you tomorrow.
chandler The cold weather hurts my hip!
phoebe Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
ross Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
phoebe I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
ross Oh my god, crap from the street?
phoebe Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy"
ross Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
phoebe I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.
ross You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
phoebe Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
ross Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
phoebe You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him
ross You're welcome.
joey "I need an answer!"
lennart "I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
joey "You know!"
lennart "I don't know!"
joey "I need an answer now!"
lennart "Alright, here, you want an answer... the answer... is..."
joey Oh!
lennart "She never loved me, she only loved you."
lennart Absolutely amazing! The part is yours.
joey Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get...
lennart Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah.
monica Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!
ross Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that...
monica .. that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
ross I see. You didn't happen to tell...
monica .. everybody we know? Yeah.
ross Great. Thanks!
