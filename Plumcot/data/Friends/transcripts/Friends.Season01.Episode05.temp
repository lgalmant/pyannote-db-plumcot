monica Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
ross Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
rachel Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
chandler We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
joey Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
phoebe Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
ross Multiple orgasms!
chandler So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
joey No plans, huh?
chandler Not a one.
ross Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
chandler Oh, right, right, shut up.
monica Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
chandler No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
joey Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
phoebe You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
chandler Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
phoebe No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
ross Tony?
monica Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
phoebe Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
rachel Does anybody want anything else?
ross Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
phoebe What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
rachel It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
ross That guy, he burns me up.
rachel Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
chandler Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
monica Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
rachel Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
phoebe Uh-huh, uh-huh.
angela Hi, Joey.
joey My god, Angela.
monica Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
phoebe Are you gonna go over there?
joey No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
angela Joey.
joey You look good.
angela That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
joey You don't say.
ross So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
rachel Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
ross Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
rachel Who?
ross Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
rachel Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
ross Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
rachel Sure.
angela Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
joey Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
angela Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
joey Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
angela Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
joey What?
angela We're just friends.
joey Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
angela What four of us?
joey You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
joey Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
monica Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
joey Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
monica Oh, god help us.
joey What?
monica Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
joey Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
monica What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
joey I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
ross Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
chandler Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
ross It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
chandler It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
ross Nuh-uh.
chandler Yuh-huh.
ross So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
chandler Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear-you want it to be dirty?
ross No.
chandler Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
ross Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
chandler There you go.
monica Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
joey Yep.
monica Which?
joey Which what?
monica You've never met Bob, have you?
joey No, but he's...
monica Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
angela Hey, Joey.
monica ..horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
chandler Where are they? Where are they?
phoebe This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
chandler It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
phoebe Eww, I don't wanna do that.
chandler Here we go.
phoebe Ok, have a good break-up.
chandler Hey, Janice.
janice Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
chandler Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
janice We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
chandler What?
janice What?
chandler What... did you get me there?
janice I got you...these.
chandler Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
janice Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
chandler That's great.
chandler Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
janice No, no, I'm still working on mine.
chandler That's it?
phoebe Yeah, it was really hard.
chandler Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
phoebe Ok, you weren't there.
woman Comin' through. Move, move.
rachel Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
woman Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
rachel But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
woman Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
rachel What?
woman No suds, no save. Ok?
ross What's goin' on?
rachel Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
ross Was your basket on top?
rachel Yeah, but, there were no suds.
ross So?
rachel Well, you know, no suds, no save.
ross No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
woman Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
ross Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
ross All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
rachel That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
ross Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
rachel What's that?
ross Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
ross Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
rachel Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
ross Rach, have you never done this before?
rachel Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
ross Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
rachel Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
ross Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
monica He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
angela Brooklyn Heights.
bob Cleveland.
monica How, how did that happen?
joey Oh my god.
monica What?
joey I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
joey So, you and Angela, huh?
bob Yep. Pretty much.
joey You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
bob Huh, I never really noticed.
joey Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
bob Monica, Monica is great.
joey Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
monica I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
angela Yeah, isn't he?
monica It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
angela You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
monica Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
angela Huh. That's nice.
phoebe Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
chandler Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
janice All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
rachel Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
ross That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
rachel What uh-oh?
ross Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
rachel Ross, what's the matter?
ross Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
rachel Come on, show me.
ross All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
rachel Oh, everything's pink.
ross Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
rachel Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
monica Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
monica Oh my god.
joey What?
monica Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
joey Come on, they're close.
monica Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
joey Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
monica Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's-not really true, is it?
joey Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
monica Oh my god, what were you thinking?
joey All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
monica Oh!
joey Ow!
monica I'm outta here.
joey Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
monica Really?
joey Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
monica I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
joey Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
chandler Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom,.. boom.
janice Ow!
chandler Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
janice Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
chandler I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
phoebe Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
chandler Oh, I don't know, a million?
phoebe Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
chandler I'm fine.
phoebe All right.
chandler I'm not fine. Here she comes.
phoebe Wait here. Breathe.
chandler How do you do that?
phoebe It's like a gift.
chandler We should always always break up together.
phoebe Oh, I'd like that.
ross You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
rachel Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
rachel Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
woman Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
rachel I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
woman Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
rachel Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
woman Let go!
rachel All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
rachel Yes! Did you see that?
ross You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
rachel I could not have done this without you.
ross Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
rachel Are you sure?
ross No.
rachel Oh, are you sure you're ok?
ross Yeah.
rachel Does it still hurt?
ross Yeah.
phoebe What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
monica Hi.
phoebe Hey, how'd it go?
joey Excellent.
monica We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
ross What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
monica Oh, I'm sorry.
rachel Where's Chandler?
phoebe Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
chandler I'm free! I'm free!
phoebe That oughta do it.
