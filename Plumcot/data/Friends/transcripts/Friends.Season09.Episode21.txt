monica_geller It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
chandler_bing I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
dr_ross_geller Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
rachel_green I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
dr_ross_geller Why do you care so much?
monica_geller Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
rachel_green Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
phoebe_buffay Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
rachel_green All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
dr_ross_geller Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
all@ Hi!
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna get some more coffee.
charlie_wheeler Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
dr_ross_geller Ok.
chandler_bing So, a professor, uh?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious That's not how she used it...?
charlie_wheeler I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
dr_ross_geller Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
charlie_wheeler You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I know the type.
joey_tribbiani Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
rachel_green Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
phoebe_buffay I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
rachel_green Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
phoebe_buffay Oh... then I overpaid.
monica_geller Hey, what's this?
rachel_green Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
monica_geller Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
rachel_green Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
monica_geller Do you wanna go hunting?
rachel_green Well, I would like to have the option!!
phoebe_buffay What's up? Hey, Rachel!!
rachel_green Oh!
phoebe_buffay No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
monica_geller And she wants to go hunting, too!!
rachel_green Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
phoebe_buffay Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
rachel_green I don't care about any of that!!
phoebe_buffay Well, do you care about friendship?
rachel_green Oh!
phoebe_buffay I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
rachel_green Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
phoebe_buffay Promise?
rachel_green I promise.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
rachel_green But I am going hunting!!
monica_geller Hey honey! I missed you today!
chandler_bing Oh, yeah?
monica_geller Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
chandler_bing Oh, well... Maybe we could...
monica_geller Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
chandler_bing We really need to take those tests?
monica_geller Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
chandler_bing But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
monica_geller What is the big deal?
chandler_bing It's weird! In a doctor's office?
monica_geller It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
chandler_bing I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
monica_geller Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
chandler_bing Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
monica_geller OH!
chandler_bing Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
joey_tribbiani Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
joey_tribbiani Heeey!
charlie_wheeler Hi!
joey_tribbiani Come on in, how are ya?
charlie_wheeler I'm good!
joey_tribbiani Can I offer you a drink?
charlie_wheeler Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...
joey_tribbiani Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!
charlie_wheeler So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
joey_tribbiani Hey, if you need a tour guide...
charlie_wheeler Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
charlie_wheeler Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
joey_tribbiani Ok!
charlie_wheeler And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
joey_tribbiani I know, yeah!
charlie_wheeler And first, I have to see the MET!
joey_tribbiani Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
charlie_wheeler No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
joey_tribbiani Which one, they all suck!
charlie_wheeler The museum!
joey_tribbiani I don't think so.
rachel_green Hi there!
the_spa_receptionist Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
rachel_green Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
the_spa_receptionist This has been torn up.
rachel_green And... taped back together.
the_spa_receptionist Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
rachel_green Ok

rachel_green through the glass doors.
the_spa_receptionist Through the glass doors.
rachel_green Alright-y then.
the_spa_receptionist Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
phoebe_buffay Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
the_spa_receptionist Sorry, everyone is booked!
phoebe_buffay But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
the_spa_receptionist Then why you work here?
phoebe_buffay 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
the_spa_receptionist Well, I think this is a great place to work!
phoebe_buffay Ok, are they listening?
joey_tribbiani Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
joey_tribbiani I need to talk to you about Charlie.
dr_ross_geller Oh, do you, do you really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
dr_ross_geller Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
joey_tribbiani No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
dr_ross_geller Get to the problem!
joey_tribbiani Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
dr_ross_geller Are you wearing two belts?
joey_tribbiani EH, what do you know!
dr_ross_geller You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
joey_tribbiani Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
dr_ross_geller You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
joey_tribbiani Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
dr_ross_geller Fine.
joey_tribbiani Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
joey_tribbiani The Metsss!
dr_ross_geller Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
joey_tribbiani Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
joey_tribbiani Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
joey_tribbiani Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
dr_ross_geller But I'm not! You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
dr_ross_geller Ok.
joey_tribbiani You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
dr_ross_geller Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right
chandler_bing I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
monica_geller Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
the_nurse Mr. Bing? Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
chandler_bing Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
monica_geller Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
chandler_bing Yeah, I guess!
monica_geller I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
janice OH MY GOD!!
chandler_bing Oh, Come on!
janice Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
monica_geller Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
chandler_bing Why are you here?
janice Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
chandler_bing No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
janice Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size
chandler_bing What!?
monica_geller This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
chandler_bing I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
janice Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
chandler_bing I think it just fell off.
phoebe_buffay Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
rachel_green Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
phoebe_buffay Okay, then I'm Swedish...
monica_geller So, what's your name?
phoebe_buffay It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
rachel_green Oh... what an interesting name.
phoebe_buffay Ja!
rachel_green You know I...
phoebe_buffay Time for your scalp massage!
rachel_green Wow... I really love your...
phoebe_buffay Is something wrong?
rachel_green No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
phoebe_buffay Uhm... Stockholm.
rachel_green Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
joey_tribbiani Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
dr_ross_geller Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
joey_tribbiani No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
dr_ross_geller Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
joey_tribbiani Phonetically?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
joey_tribbiani Ok.
dr_ross_geller Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
joey_tribbiani Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
dr_ross_geller Wow. What does that mean?
joey_tribbiani No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
dr_ross_geller Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
joey_tribbiani Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy!
dr_ross_geller Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
joey_tribbiani Come on! you...
dr_ross_geller No!
chandler_bing My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
janice Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
chandler_bing Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
janice That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
chandler_bing I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
janice Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
chandler_bing Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
janice Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
chandler_bing oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
janice What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
chandler_bing It was a "Wendy's!! "
phoebe_buffay "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
rachel_green Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Ja! Ja!
rachel_green Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
phoebe_buffay Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
rachel_green I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
phoebe_buffay Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
rachel_green Phoebe!!
phoebe_buffay You know it's me?
rachel_green For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
phoebe_buffay How can you come here?
rachel_green How could you not tell me you worked here?
phoebe_buffay I don't have to tell you everything!
rachel_green Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
phoebe_buffay Tips not included.
rachel_green Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
phoebe_buffay Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
rachel_green Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
phoebe_buffay You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
rachel_green Good for you Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Ok.
phoebe_buffay Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
dr_ross_geller Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
dr_ross_geller Respectfully, professor R. Geller. Hey!
charlie_wheeler Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey, how was the Met?
charlie_wheeler The museum was amazing!
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
charlie_wheeler Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
dr_ross_geller What do you mean?
charlie_wheeler Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
charlie_wheeler No, we went to the left.
dr_ross_geller Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
charlie_wheeler Yeah, it's fun
dr_ross_geller What?
charlie_wheeler Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
dr_ross_geller What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
charlie_wheeler Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
charlie_wheeler Yeah, I guess that's true.
dr_ross_geller And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
charlie_wheeler He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
dr_ross_geller That was going to be my next argument.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
charlie_wheeler Hey!
joey_tribbiani You're ready?
charlie_wheeler Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
dr_ross_geller Glad I could help man.
joey_tribbiani Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work.
chandler_bing It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
chandler_bing Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
monica_geller Hey sweetie.
chandler_bing Doctor Connelly just called.
monica_geller With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
chandler_bing Actually it's both of us.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
monica_geller Oh... what does that mean?
chandler_bing It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
monica_geller Chandler?
chandler_bing It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
monica_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing I'm sorry.
monica_geller I'm sorry too.
chandler_bing Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
monica_geller I know.
the_spa_receptionist Good morning Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Good morning receptionist.
the_spa_receptionist Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.
phoebe_buffay Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?
phoebe_buffay Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
