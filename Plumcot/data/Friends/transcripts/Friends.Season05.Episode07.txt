chandler_bing Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
joey_tribbiani No, look.
chandler_bing That's a pig.
joey_tribbiani I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Emily's cousin kicked me out!
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani Why?
dr_ross_geller Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
chandler_bing How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
dr_ross_geller Who needs a lease when it's family!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
chandler_bing Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller You got it.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
dr_ross_geller Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing He thought you said gonad.
health_inspector#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode07 Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
monica_geller Oh, Larry.
phoebe_buffay Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
larry No, bribes.
phoebe_buffay It's okay to laugh right?
larry Yeah, I was just kidding.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
larry I'll check the kitchen floors.
monica_geller Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
phoebe_buffay Yum-my!
monica_geller Larry?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
larry A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
monica_geller Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
larry And where is your hat?
monica_geller It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
larry Ahh that's the 2 points.
phoebe_buffay Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
larry Oh, I don't know about that.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
larry Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
phoebe_buffay Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
larry I-I'll call ya.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
phoebe_buffay He's so funny!
monica_geller Thanks.
rachel_green Thank you. Mon?
monica_geller Hmm?
rachel_green How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
monica_geller He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try
rachel_green Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
monica_geller Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
danny Two pounds of Moca Java please.
monica_geller Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
rachel_green I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
danny Hey!
rachel_green Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
danny Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
monica_geller Ohh, fun!
rachel_green Ohh, great!
danny Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
rachel_green Yeah.
danny Okay, see ya.
monica_geller Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
rachel_green Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
monica_geller And you're not gonna do that.
rachel_green That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
monica_geller So-so there is no party.
rachel_green No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
monica_geller I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
rachel_green Exactly.
joey_tribbiani Ross?
dr_ross_geller Hey roomies!
chandler_bing Love what you've done with the place.
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
joey_tribbiani Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
chandler_bing Oh yeah!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
joey_tribbiani Hey, all right!
dr_ross_geller Pretty cool, huh?
joey_tribbiani You're fake laughing too, right?
chandler_bing Oh, the tears are real.
larry You look beautiful this evening.
phoebe_buffay Show me the badge again.
phoebe_buffay Shiny.
larry Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
phoebe_buffay You are just nonstop!
larry We're outta here!
phoebe_buffay Why?!
larry Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
phoebe_buffay You have the power to do that?
larry This does.
phoebe_buffay Shut it down.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Nothing.
chandler_bing You built a fort didn't ya?
joey_tribbiani Kinda.
chandler_bing Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
joey_tribbiani Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
chandler_bing I hate this thing!
joey_tribbiani Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
rachel_green Oh, hi Danny.
danny Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
monica_geller Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
rachel_green Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
monica_geller You are?
rachel_green Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
danny Yeah, what's the gala for?
rachel_green It's a uh, regatta gala.
danny Really! You-you sail?
rachel_green No-no, but I support it.
danny Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
monica_geller Okay.
danny Take care.
rachel_green Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
monica_geller What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
rachel_green Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
monica_geller Great. So the ball is in his court?
rachel_green Ball? There is no ball.
dr_ross_geller Joey, please!
joey_tribbiani Sorry.
joey_tribbiani Ahhhhhhhhhh

joey_tribbiani All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
chandler_bing Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
joey_tribbiani No, the quiet down thing!
chandler_bing You mean this.
joey_tribbiani Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
chandler_bing All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
joey_tribbiani All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
chandler_bing Okay.
chandler_bing No-no-no-no!
joey_tribbiani YES!!
dr_ross_geller Uh fellas,
chandler_bing Okay, so he's out of here.
joey_tribbiani Um-hmm.

monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
monica_geller I don't know, clean places?
joey_tribbiani Umm, yum!
monica_geller It's Danny.
rachel_green Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
monica_geller We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
rachel_green What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
monica_geller The fake kind!
danny Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
monica_geller We have a ladle.
danny Thanks, see you at the party.
monica_geller Okay, great!
phoebe_buffay Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
chandler_bing Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
dr_ross_geller I'll take sports.
joey_tribbiani Mine!
dr_ross_geller All right. Uhh, international.
joey_tribbiani Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
dr_ross_geller Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
chandler_bing Not even on page 7?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
chandler_bing What about that circled one?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
joey_tribbiani But it's available now! Isn't it?
chandler_bing Yes, it is.
joey_tribbiani Hey, let's go look at it!
dr_ross_geller Okay, let's go.
joey_tribbiani Okay!
chandler_bing There we go!
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
chandler_bing Let's go quicker.
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
joey_tribbiani Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
dr_ross_geller I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
joey_tribbiani But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
chandler_bing Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
dr_ross_geller So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it's perfect!
dr_ross_geller How about you?
chandler_bing It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
dr_ross_geller All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
chandler_bing We are bad people.
joey_tribbiani He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
larry Hey, ready for dinner?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, absolutely!
larry Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
larry How about Mama Lisettie's?
phoebe_buffay Enh. Sure!
larry I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
phoebe_buffay Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
larry Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
gunther But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
larry Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
phoebe_buffay Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
larry Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
phoebe_buffay Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
joey_tribbiani Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
chandler_bing Yes that was a nice place!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing What are we gonna do?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. Maybe pizza?
chandler_bing About Ross!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Oh!
joey_tribbiani Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
chandler_bing Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
chandler_bing Ohhhhh!
rachel_green Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
monica_geller Just go over and say hi.
rachel_green No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
