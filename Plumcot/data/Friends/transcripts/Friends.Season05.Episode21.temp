gary Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
phoebe I'm fine, thanks.
chandler Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
monica No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
chandler Okay.
chandler Hiya doin' pumpkin?
phoebe Nope.
monica So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
gary I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
monica Oh my God!
gary What do you, what do you think?
monica I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
gary Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
monica I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
gary I'll see you after work sweetie.
phoebe Okay. Bye!
phoebe So, what movie should we see?
monica Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
phoebe What?! Really?!
monica He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
phoebe I can't believe this!
chandler Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
monica Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
chandler Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
phoebe No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
monica Ohhhh!
phoebe No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
chandler So, what are you gonna do?
phoebe I don't know. I'll just handle it - I'll ask you to talk to him!
chandler Me?! Why me?
phoebe Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a... man!
chandler I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
monica That is so sweet!
chandler Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
joey Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
ross Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
joey Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
ross Also an island.
joey Hey, what time is it?
ross 2
joey Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
ross Are you serious?!
joey Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
ross Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
joey Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
rachel Hey, you guys
joey Hey!
rachel Is Monica here?
joey_and_ross No.
rachel All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
ross You bought Shawn Cassidy!
rachel Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
joey_and_ross Yeah!
rachel Okay! Check it out!
ross What-what is it?!
joey What the hell is that?!!
rachel It's a, it's a cat!
joey That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
rachel Yes it is!
ross Why is it inside out?!
rachel Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
ross How much did you pay for that?
rachel Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
ross Yeah? How much?
rachel A thousand bucks.
ross ON A CAT??!!!!
joey It's not a cat!
rachel All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
ross Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
joey It's not a cat!
rachel Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
ross Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
joey Uhh, the ball thing.
ross Yeah?
joey Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
ross Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
joey Okay!
joey Uh-oh.
ross What?
joey I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
joey Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
ross I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
chandler Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
gary Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
chandler Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
gary Yeah?
chandler It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
gary What's up?
chandler Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
gary Sure. Okay.
chandler Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
gary Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
chandler You mean scared.
gary No, I mean happy.
chandler Scared? Happy?
gary Chandler, what-what are you doing?
chandler I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
gary I know! I can't wait!
chandler Were you're parents happy, or something?
gary Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just - I wanna be around her as much as I can.
chandler Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
gary So you know what I'm talking about, right?
chandler Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
gary No, it's too soon for you guys.
chandler Yeah, you're right about that.
ross now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
joey Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
monica Hey guys!
joey Hi!
monica Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
joey I don't know.
monica All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
ross How do you know? You don't have a watch.
monica Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
joey Oh, I don't know... . Yeah, can't do it.
monica What?!
ross Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
joey Yeah, we haven't dropped it in
ross 2 hours, 27 minutes.
monica Really?!
monica I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
ross Hey Rach!
rachel Hey.
ross Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
rachel Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
monica Rach?
rachel Yeah?
monica You have scratches all over you, what happened?
rachel Well, it's my cat.
monica What?!
rachel Oh yeah, I got a cat.
monica I don't want a cat!
joey Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
ross Yeah.
rachel You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
ross Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
monica What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
rachel Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
chandler Hi!
phoebe Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
chandler Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
phoebe What?!
chandler He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
phoebe You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
chandler I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
phoebe Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
gary Hey Chandler.
chandler Hey Gar!
gary Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe Yeah! Okay.
gary You look very pretty today.
phoebe Thanks! Okay.
gary Here's the thing.
phoebe Yeah?
gary Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
phoebe Uh-hmm.
gary Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
phoebe No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
gary Phoebe?
phoebe Yeah?
gary I want you to move in with me.
phoebe That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
gary Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
phoebe I just - I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
gary Uh-huh.
phoebe I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just - I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
gary Yeah.
phoebe Which is why my answer is yes!
gary Really?!
phoebe Uh-huh! I'm so... happy.
ross Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
chandler Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
joey That's right baby.
chandler All right, let me in.
monica No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
chandler What?
monica He's a dropper!
joey Oh yeah, that's right!
chandler I'm not a dropper!
ross It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
chandler It's throwing and catching!
ross All right.
chandler Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
joey Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
monica Oh my - Oh good God!
rachel I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
ross Baking it didn't help, huh?
monica So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
rachel I tried! They won't take her back.
chandler Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
monica Rach, why won't they take it back?
rachel Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
monica Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
rachel No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
monica Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
chandler Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
phoebe_and_gary Hey!
all Hey!
gary We have great news!
phoebe We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
all Congratulations! Congrats!
phoebe I know, I'm so excited!
gary So am I!
phoebe Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
gary Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
phoebe Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
gary All right.
monica So you're moving in with him. What happened?
phoebe I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
monica Why, do you write him a lot?
phoebe No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
all Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
phoebe Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
gary Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
phoebe No, nothing.
gary Oh really?
phoebe Yeah.
gary Nothing at all?
phoebe No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
gary Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe Uh-huh!
gary Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
phoebe Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
gary So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
phoebe Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
gary In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
phoebe Umm, yeah! Today's.
gary 'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
phoebe Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
gary Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
phoebe Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
gary Phoebe
phoebe Yeah?
gary Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
phoebe That's so sweet.
gary Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just - I want you to be happy
phoebe Living with you would make me happy.
gary Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
phoebe No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
gary Are you sure?
phoebe Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
gary Oh that's great!
phoebe Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
rachel Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
woman_no_1 Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
rachel It's not a baby! It's a cat!
woman_no_1 Eew! It's creepy looking!
rachel Oh no! No! It's actually - it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
woman_no_1 No, I hate cats.
rachel Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
woman_no_2 Wow! What an unusual cat!
rachel Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
woman_no_2 Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
rachel Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
woman_no_2 What?!
rachel Okay, a thousand.
woman_no_2 I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
rachel Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
woman_no_2 Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
rachel Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
ross I'm starving!
monica Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
joey I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
monica Please! I made this game what it is.
chandler Not fun anymore?
ross I'm still hungry!
monica All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
ross I am!
monica All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
monica Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
rachel It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
ross Oh, thank God!
joey Did you get your money back?
rachel Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
monica Wow! You made a profit!
gunther I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
rachel Oh yeah, there you go.
gunther Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
rachel Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
gunther Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
gary I really like waking up with you.
phoebe I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
gary That would be great!
phoebe We could have breakfast in bed
gary Wait, just a second.
phoebe Okay. Oh! Oh no.
monica All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
phoebe Oh good, you're all up.
rachel Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
phoebe Oh yeah, that's over.
all What?!
chandler Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
phoebe He shot a bird!
chandler Oh that is over!
all That's terrible! I'm sorry!
rachel Phoebe, are you okay?
phoebe Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
joey Oh hey, here Pheebs.
phoebe Nah, I don't feel like playing.
monica It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
all All right. Okay. I'm starving!
rachel Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
phoebe Yeah!
monica Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
chandler You guys wanna eat here?
all Yeah! As long as we're here!
joey Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
rachel Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
ross I know. My arm is killing me.
rachel No, I meant with the dropper over here.
chandler Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
