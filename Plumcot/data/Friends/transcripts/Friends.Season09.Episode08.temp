monica Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
chandler Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
monica No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
chandler Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
monica What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
chandler What is the point of having them if we never use them?
monica Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..
chandler I will explain it to her.
monica Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
joey wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
tv_announcer Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
chandler Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo! TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives
joey Oh my God!
chandler Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
joey Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
chandler What are you going to do?
joey I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
chandler Well you proved them wrong.
joey_nods Yeah.
rachel_to_emma Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
ross A lot of people are thankful for those.
woman_at_door Hello? Rachel?
rachel Who is it?
woman_at_door It's your favorite sister.
ross_and_rachel Jill?
woman_at_door_in_a_sing_song_voice Amy.

rachel Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
amy Do you have a hair straightener?
rachel Um... hi.
amy oh... hi..
rachel Aw.
amy Hair Straightener?
rachel I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
amy Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
rachel Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
amy I decorated Dad's office.
rachel Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.
amy Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
amy Oh my God!
rachel mh hmm..
amy Is this Emmett?
rachel Uh.... its Emma.
amy Its a girl?
ross Hey Amy.
rachel Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
amy Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.
ross That was me.
amy No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.
ross Still me.
amy No, I'm not talking about you. It was your fat friends brother with that bad afro, do you remember?
ross Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. All me.
monica Careful. Careful. CAREFUL!
chandler I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
monica I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
chandler Why?
monica well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
chandler Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
phoebe Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
joey Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!
phoebe Hey, what's going on Joe?
joey I.. I.. I need a good lie.
phoebe Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
joey No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
phoebe Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
joey I do not.
phoebe Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
joey Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. He said.. "Joey you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
phoebe Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
joey Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
phoebe Sure, what.. what was the work thing?
joey Uh..
phoebe "Pick up grandma at the airport"?
joey Oh.. man..
rachel Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
amy Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
ross Sure, we don't live there but...
amy Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? I thought you were a doctor.
rachel Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
amy Ew.
rachel God she is unbelievable.
ross I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
rachel Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
amy_storms_out Stupid Thanksgiving.
rachel What? What happened?
amy My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.
ross Don't say that.
amy Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.
rachel Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
ross Sure, you want to go upstairs?
rachel Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
ross You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
rachel Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
ross Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
rachel Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!
rachel_opens_their_door Hi.
everyone_there_says Hi, hey.
rachel Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
everyone Hi.
amy Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.
joey_laughs Yeah.
amy wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
joey_looks_rejected Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
ross_to_monica Hi.
monica_to_ross Hi.
monica_to_emma Hey you.
monica_to_amy So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
phoebe_shakes_her_hand_and_says Phoe-Be.
amy Oh. That's a funny noise.
joey Pheebs, I still need some help here
phoebe Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
joey Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
phoebe_looks_down You are a terrific actor.
amy_coming_out_of_the_bathroom Hey. Hey where's the baby?
rachel Oh we just put her down for a nap.
amy Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.
ross Thank you Amy.
amy no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.
phoebe Thats a great movie.
amy Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
ross Emma.
amy_turns_around_to_phoebe Emma, Ross wants you.
phoebe PHOE-BE.
amy_turns_to_ross_and_rachel Why does she keep making that noise?
rachel Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
amy Well who would?
ross Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
chandler I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
monica yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
amy I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
rachel See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
amy Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's a lump.
chandler You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....
amy This guy? Seriously?
monica Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
monica Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved.
joey Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
monica No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
joey I can't believe I won.
amy Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
rachel Monica is Ross' sister.
amy No, Ross' sister was really fat.
monica That was me.
amy No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
rachel Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
monica Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
monica Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
amy Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
chandler No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
rachel Well actually...
chandler Actually what?
ross well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
chandler What?
amy Hurts, doesn't it?
joey_raises_his_hand Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?
chandler So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
ross_looks_down No, that that is not what we're saying.
joey Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
chandler Well what is wrong with me? Am I. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
rachel Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
ross Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
monica Thats not how you see me, is it?
phoebe No you're all about the fun.
chandler Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
ross No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
chandler Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
ross Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
joey I lie better then that, right?
chandler So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
phoebe There's your movie!
monica Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
chandler Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
monica Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
chandler Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
monica No you learn these things. You grow into it.
chandler Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
monica I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
chandler Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
monica Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?
chandler You said that to me last week.
monica How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.
joey_groans_and_gets_off_the_phone The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
phoebe It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
joey Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
phoebe Ooh, what happened?
joey Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
phoebe No! Nothing with a raccoon.
joey Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it.
monica Oh wait.. What are you doing?
joey Setting the table.
phoebe Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
monica Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
ross Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
chandler Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.
amy Ucch. Uchh. In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
rachel UCHH!
amy You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
rachel Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
amy This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.
rachel What? What carrer?
amy Um.. I'm a decorator.
rachel Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
amy Why can't you ever be supportive?
rachel Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
amy Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
rachel I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
ross Emma.
rachel_turns_to_ross Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
amy How hard could it be? You do it.
joey ooh oooh..
amy Do you want to know why you don't want me to have the baby?
rachel uh huh.
amy Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
rachel Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
amy Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
rachel Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
amy Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
rachel I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
amy Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
rachel ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
amy You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
ross_walks_over Too far, Amy. Too far.
rachel You take that back.
amy No.
rachel Take it back!
amy No! What are you going to do? Make me?
rachel Heey man, I work out.
amy So do I.
rachel I do pilates.
amy I do yoga.
rachel Bring it on!
monica Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
rachel Did you just push me?
amy Uh, yeah I think I did.
rachel Alright. Thats it!
monica_screaming_at_ross Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
rachel Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
phoebe Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
joey What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
rachel Ew! Gross.
chandler Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
amy I'm sorry.
rachel Mon, I'm so sorry.
chandler Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
amy_and_rachel_at_same_time Sorry.
chandler By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
ross Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
chandler Oh yeah? Well thanks.
ross So, so now do I get Joey?
chandler Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
rachel Are you okay Mon?
monica uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
phoebe It's all right. You can mourn.
monica_starts_crying Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
joey Actually its not pies, its just pie.
monica I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
rachel Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
amy So you're going to give me the baby?
rachel Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
amy_starting_to_cry You are not going to regret this.
rachel She needs changing.
chandler Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
phoebe Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
chandler Nope...
phoebe Broke them all, huh?
chandler Yep...
phoebe You gonna tell her?
chandler Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
monica Like only if the queen comes?
chandler Maybe not even then.
joey Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
phoebe No problem! Next week: stealing...
monica Bye plates!
joey Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
monica What? Something happened with the plates?
joey Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
