_ross Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
phoebe Because she's your lobster.
chandler Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
phoebe C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
_chandler Hey, you feelin' better?
monica Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
_phoebe So, do you have any other possibilities?
monica Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
ross Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
monica No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
ross Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
chandler Ya know, the man's got a point.
_phoebe What is that sparkly thing?
chandler That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
ross No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
monica Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
monica Hi.
mr_geller Hi.
mrs_geller Hi darling.
monica So, what's this.
mr_geller Some of your old stuff.
mrs_geller Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
monica Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
mr_geller Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
monica Oh, God forbid.
mrs_geller Oh, hi Rachel.
rachel Hi.
mrs_geller Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
rachel Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
mr_geller Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
rachel What, what incident?
mr_geller Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.

chandler Chandler.
gail I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
_chandler What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
phoebe It's not that bad.
chandler Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
phoebe Chandler, Chandler.
_chandler I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
ross Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
phoebe I think she's OK.
ross Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel?
rachel What?
ross I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.

ross OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
rachel What?
ross I was saving you.
rachel Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?

ross But, you are.
rachel What?
ross Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
rachel OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
ross No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
phoebe Do the claws again.
ross Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
rachel Ross, there is no us, OK.
ross No, but. . .
rachel No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
ross Well, but, but. . .
rachel NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
ross E-except, except that what?
rachel No, no, ACC-cept that.
ross Oh.
_chandler Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
joey If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
chandler Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
_joey Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
chandler OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
joey You know what the. . .
_chandler I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
mr_geller You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
ross Hey guys.
mrs_geller Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
ross No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
mr_geller A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
mrs_geller Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
_monica Where have you been?
ross Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
monica No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
ross C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
_monica Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
mrs_geller Why?
monica Because they made me.
mrs_geller You were fired? What're you gonna do?
mr_geller Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
monica_and_ross In the bank.
mr_geller There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
monica Anything larger back there?
chandler I can't believe it.
_phoebe Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
chandler Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
rachel Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
phoebe Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
chandler What am I gonna do, huh?
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
joey How come you have two?
chandler Well this one's for you.
_joey Get out.
chandler No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
_joey Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
chandler That's what they'll call us.
ross Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
monica You have dinosaur checks?
ross Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
monica Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
phoebe Hey, Mon, what is this?
_monica Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
chandler Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
joey Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
monica Hey, you got me, put it in.
ross Oh.
rachel Hi.

mrs_geller Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
_rachel Oh my God.

chandler OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
monica You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
rachel Oh.

chandler Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
joey Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
chandler Work on your music?
rachel Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
monica Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
_monica I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
ross OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
all No, no, no.
ross OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
_monica I can't believe you did that.
ross Yeah, well.
phoebe See, he's her lobster.
