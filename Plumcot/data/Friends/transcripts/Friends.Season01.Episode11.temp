phoebe Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
monica Why?
phoebe Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
monica Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
phoebe Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
monica He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
guy Nice hat.
monica_and_phoebe Thanks.
phoebe We should do something. Whistle.
monica We are not going to whistle.
phoebe Come on, do it.
monica No!
phoebe Do it!
monica No!
phoebe Do it do it do it!
monica Woo-woo!
phoebe I can't believe you did that!
monica Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
phoebe I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
monica Phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe Maybe nobody's tried this.
monica I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
phoebe Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
monica Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
phoebe Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
monica I wish all guys could be like him.
phoebe I know.
chandler Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
monica He doesn't have anyone.
phoebe Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
joey I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
rachel Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
jay_leno Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
chandler Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
rachel No way, forget it.
joey C'mon, she's your mom!
chandler Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
rachel Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
chandler Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
ross C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
chandler You can say that because she's not your mom.
ross Oh, please...
paolo Bona sera.
rachel Oh, hi sweetie.
ross When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
monica Last night.
ross Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
phoebe Hey hey hey! She's on!
paolo Ah! Nora Bing!
jay_leno ..Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
phoebe Your mom was arrested?
chandler Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
mrs_bing ..This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
chandler Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
all Shhh.
mrs_bing ..I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
chandler THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
jay_leno Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
mrs_bing Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
all Awww!
chandler This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
jay_leno Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
mrs_bing Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
chandler ..And then he burst into flames.
monica Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
phoebe What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
monica Nah... not-not special enough.
phoebe Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
monica Waaay too special.
mrs_bing I am famished. What do I want...
chandler Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
mrs_bing Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
chandler Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
ross What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
mrs_bing Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
chandler I know I am.
mrs_bing Who's doing shots?
monica Yeah.
phoebe I'm in.
mrs_bing There y'go. Ross?
ross Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
rachel Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
ross ..But a man can change.
ross Anyone want me to appraise anything?
rachel Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
mrs_bing Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
chandler Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
mrs_bing Yeah, any messages for room 226?
mrs_bing You okay there, slugger?
ross Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
mrs_bing What is with you tonight?
ross Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
mrs_bing Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
ross No. It's the one he's licking.
mrs_bing She's supposed to be with you.
ross You're good.
mrs_bing Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
ross The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
mrs_bing No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
ross When?
mrs_bing He's not a hero...You know who our hero is.
ross The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
mrs_bing No, it's you!
ross Please.
mrs_bing No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
ross Right.
mrs_bing You are gonna be fine, believe me.
ross Uh-oh...
joey Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
ross Hey, is Chandler here?
joey Yeah.
ross Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
joey Right. No big deal.
ross Okay.
joey In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
ross What code?
joey You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
chandler What are you guys doing out here?
ross Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
joey Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
ross No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
joey Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
chandler Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
ross Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
joey Ross, how could you let this happen?
ross I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
joey You don't think my mom's sexy?
ross Well... not in the same way...
joey I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
ross Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
rachel Hey.
ross Hey.
rachel What're you guys doing out here?
ross Well, not playing raquetball!
joey He forgot to leave his grip size!
ross He didn't get the goggles!
rachel Well,sounds like you two have issues.
rachel Goodbye, baby.
paolo Ciao, bela.
ross Do they wait for me to do this?
joey So are you gonna tell him?
ross Why would I tell him?
joey How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
ross Oh...
monica What are you guys doing here?
joey Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
monica ..What did I ask?
monica Hi.
phoebe Hi.
monica What are you doing here?
phoebe Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
monica I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
phoebe No. No! No!..So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
monica How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
phoebe Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
chandler Oh my God.
ross You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
chandler I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
ross Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
chandler What?
ross I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
chandler You knew about this?
joey Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
chandler I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
joey Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
ross Thanks, man, big help.
chandler I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
ross I wasn't- I mean, I-
chandler Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
ross I know-
chandler I can't believe you did this.
ross Chandler-
joey Me neither, y'know what-
chandler I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
joey What are you mad at me for?!
ross Chandler-
chandler You gotta let me slam the door!
joey Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
ross Joey-
joey Ah! Huh?
monica Hey.
rachel Hey.
monica 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
rachel Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
monica Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
phoebe Hey Rach.
rachel Hey.
phoebe Hello.
monica Hello.
phoebe Going to the hospital tonight?
monica No, you?
phoebe No, you?
monica You just asked me.
phoebe Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
rachel Okay. I am so hot!
joey Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
ross I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
joey C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
rachel Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
rachel Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
chandler What was that?
ross Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
chandler Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
joey Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
ross Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
chandler Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
ross Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
chandler Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
ross We're rehearsing a Greek play.
chandler That's very funny. We done now?
ross No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
chandler That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
ross Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
phoebe Alright, whadyou do with him?
monica Oh! You're awake!
phoebe Look at you! How, how do you feel?
coma_guy Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
monica You look good!
coma_guy I feel good!..Who are you?
monica Oh, sorry.
phoebe I'm Phoebe Buffay.
monica I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
phoebe Well, we both have.
coma_guy So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
phoebe Well, actually it's just from me.
monica I got you the foot massager.
phoebe You know who shaved you? That was me.
monica I read to you.
phoebe I sang. Hah!
coma_guy Well,... thanks.
monica Oh, my pleasure.
phoebe You're welcome.
coma_guy So. I guess I'll see you around.
phoebe What, that's it?
monica "See you around?"
coma_guy Well, what do you want me to say?
monica Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
coma_guy Alright, I'll call you.
phoebe I don't think you mean that.
monica This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
phoebe Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
mrs_bing Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
chandler No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
mrs_bing Alright, well, be good, I love you.
chandler You kissed my best Ross!..Or something to that effect.
mrs_bing O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
chandler Really stupid.
mrs_bing Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
chandler Yeah. No. No...
ross Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
joey Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
ross You're kidding.
joey No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
ross Wow!
joey Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
ross 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
joey That makes more sense.
ross So, what's going on now?
joey I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
ross Whaddya see?
joey Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
mrs_bing You okay, kiddo?
chandler Yeah, okay.
mrs_bing Alright.
chandler Nice save.
ross Mrs. Bing.
mrs_bing Mr. Geller.
chandler Hey.
ross You mean that?
chandler Yeah, why not. So I told her.
ross Yeah? How'd it go?
chandler Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
ross Well, howdya feel?
chandler Pretty good! I told her.
ross Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
rachel Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
monica What's a 'niffle'?
joey You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
rachel Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
ross Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
rachel Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
all Nooo!
