dr_ross_geller Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
all@ Oooh!
monica_geller W-wait. What is that?
dr_ross_geller 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
monica_geller No, no, I don't.
rachel_green Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
dr_ross_geller My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
phoebe_buffay That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
chandler_bing Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
monica_geller Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
monica_geller Why don't you just get a roommate?
dr_ross_geller Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
phoebe_buffay So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
chandler_bing Might wanna open with the snowman.
all@ Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
monica_geller So, how'd it go?
joey_tribbiani Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
dr_ross_geller How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
joey_tribbiani I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
monica_geller So what are you gonna be?
joey_tribbiani Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
rachel_green Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
chandler_bing Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday
rachel_green Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you wish!
chandler_bing It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
all@ Yeah, okay. Alright.
chandler_bing Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
all@ Woooo! Yeah!
rachel_green Phoebe, you're on.
phoebe_buffay Oh, oh, good.
rachel_green Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
phoebe_buffay Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Sung
max No. No, that's- that's okay.
phoebe_buffay Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
chandler_bing That guy's going home with a note!
david Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
phoebe_buffay Could you speak up please?
david Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
max Daryl Hannah.
david Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
max Hard quality.
david -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
phoebe_buffay Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
joey_tribbiani Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
dr_ross_geller Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
rachel_green Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
dr_ross_geller Just a smidge.
phoebe_buffay David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
monica_geller I think it's romantic.
phoebe_buffay Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
rachel_green Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
chandler_bing Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
phoebe_buffay No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
chandler_bing Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
monica_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
chandler_bing I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
monica_geller Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
chandler_bing I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
joey_tribbiani Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
chandler_bing Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
joey_tribbiani Nice shoes, huh?
chandler_bing Aah, y'killing me!
monica_geller Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
dr_ross_geller Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
monica_geller Do you always have to bring him here?
dr_ross_geller I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
chandler_bing Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
dr_ross_geller Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
chandler_bing Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
david ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
phoebe_buffay Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
david Yuh.
phoebe_buffay Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
david Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
phoebe_buffay Sure.
david Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
phoebe_buffay Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
david Rrrreally.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
david ...Now? Now?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, right now.
david Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
phoebe_buffay Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
david Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
phoebe_buffay I can hop.
dr_ross_geller So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
monica_geller I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
chandler_bing Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
monica_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani You know more than one Fun Bobby?
chandler_bing I happen to know a Fun Bob.
rachel_green Okay, here we go...
joey_tribbiani Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
rachel_green There. Now there is.
dr_ross_geller Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
joey_tribbiani Uh, four.
dr_ross_geller Four.
rachel_green Five.
dr_ross_geller Five.
rachel_green Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
dr_ross_geller Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
rachel_green Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
monica_geller What's the matter?
dr_ross_geller Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
chandler_bing That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
dr_ross_geller Really.
chandler_bing Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
dr_ross_geller What, uh... what juggling thing?
chandler_bing With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
max Phoebe. Hi.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
max No. Have you seen David?
phoebe_buffay No, no, he hasn't been around.
max Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
phoebe_buffay Minsk?
max Minsk. It's in Russia.
phoebe_buffay I know where Minsk is.
max We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
phoebe_buffay So when, when do you leave?
max January first.
phoebe_buffay Hello?
david Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hi.
david Hi! What-what're you doing here?
phoebe_buffay Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
max It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
max Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
david Thank you, Max. Thank you.
phoebe_buffay So-so you're really not going?
david I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
phoebe_buffay Oh don't do that.
david Please.
phoebe_buffay Oh no no.
david No, but I'm asking-
phoebe_buffay Oh, but I can't do that-
david No, but I can't-
phoebe_buffay It's your thing, and-
david -make the decision-
phoebe_buffay Okay, um, stay.
david Stay.
phoebe_buffay Stay.
phoebe_buffay Getting so good at that!
david It was Max's stuff.
janice I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
chandler_bing You remember Janice.
monica_geller Vividly.
monica_geller Hi.
sandy Hi, I'm Sandy.
joey_tribbiani Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
sandy Yeah. That's okay, right?
dr_ross_geller Par-tay!
monica_geller That thing is not coming in here.
dr_ross_geller 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
monica_geller I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
dr_ross_geller Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
monica_geller Alright. Just keep him away from me.
dr_ross_geller Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
monica_geller Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
rachel_green Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
phoebe_buffay And then... your face is bloated?
rachel_green No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
sandy Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
joey_tribbiani Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
sandy Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey, kids...
dr_ross_geller Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
janice There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
chandler_bing But you found me!
janice Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
chandler_bing Kill me. Kill me now.
monica_geller Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
fun_bobby Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
joey_tribbiani Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
fun_bobby It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
janice Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
chandler_bing Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
janice Oh, no. Oh, no.
chandler_bing I'm sorry you misunderstood...
janice Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
chandler_bing Oh, will you give me the thing.
phoebe_buffay Hi, Max!
max Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
david Wow.
max It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
phoebe_buffay Are you alright?
david Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
phoebe_buffay You're going to Minsk.
david No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
david Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
phoebe_buffay Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
david Uh, ow.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
david I'll never forget you.
phoebe_buffay And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
dick_clark Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
joey_tribbiani There y'go, kids.
chandler_bing And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
joey_tribbiani You seen Sandy?
chandler_bing Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
rachel_green Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
all@ What?
rachel_green The bll is drrbing!
dick_clark In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
chandler_bing And the moment of joy is upon us.
joey_tribbiani Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
phoebe_buffay Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
monica_geller Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
chandler_bing Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
phoebe_buffay I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
rachel_green I can't kiss anyone.
monica_geller So I'm kissing everyone?
joey_tribbiani Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
dr_ross_geller Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
chandler_bing Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
joey_tribbiani Alrightalrightalright. There.
dr_ross_geller I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
rachel_green ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
