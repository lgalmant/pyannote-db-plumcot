rachel Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
joey Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
all Who?
joey All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
all Wow!
joey Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
chandler 'Cause he was just so darn cute.
joey No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
ross Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
joey I did do it, I'm a professional.
monica Then what's the problem?
joey See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
phoebe Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
chandler Hey, what did your agent say?
joey Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
monica What, forget it!
rachel Yeah, right.
joey Come on, I need your help here.
phoebe All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
joey You see this, this is a friend.
phoebe Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
joey Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
monica Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
joey Yeah, that makes sense.
ross Over my dead body!
chandler And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
ross Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
phoebe Oh my God, you look so good!
rachel I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
rachel Because I promised Mindy I would.
monica Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
rachel Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
phoebe Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
chandler I may have.
monica Woo-hoo, stuud!
ross What's she look like?
chandler Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
monica Woo-hoo, geeek!
chandler I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
ross Get out!
rachel Nooo!
monica Please!
chandler Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
rachel Wow! What's that like?
chandler It's like this, me, no jokes.
phoebe All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
richard Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
all Bye, Richard.
monica Bye sweetie, I love you.
richard I love you, too.
phoebe I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
monica What are you talking about? What wedding?
phoebe Come on, like you never talk that.
monica Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
rachel Afraid to ask him?
monica Could not be more terrified.
chandler Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
monica Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
richard Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
monica Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
richard Okay.
monica Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
richard Sure I do.
monica Yeah, am I in it?
richard Honey, you are in it.
monica Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
richard Oh, yeah!
monica Keep talkin'.
richard Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
monica Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
richard Like a hound?
monica Not a basset, a bassinet.
richard You really need the bassinet?
monica Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
richard Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
monica Uh-huh.
richard Look I want you, now.
monica That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
joey Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
chandler Joey, no means no!
rachel Hey!
chandler I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
joey Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .

phoebe So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
chandler Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim
phoebe What does she mean by HH?
chandler It means we're holding hands.
phoebe Are you the cutest?
chandler I'm afraid I might just be.
phoebe You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
chandler Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
phoebe It could be like a big giant guy.
joey Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
phoebe We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
joey Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
chandler How do you not fall down more?
phoebe Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
chandler All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
phoebe Well at least we know she's a woman.
chandler I can't believe she's married.
joey Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
monica So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
richard Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
monica Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
richard Neither am I.
ross Hey, there.
rachel Hi.
ross Are you all right?
rachel Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
ross Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
rachel God I know, you're right.
wedding_planner All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
rachel Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
ross Okay, good luck
rachel Thank you, Okay, Okay.
rachel Why the hell didn't you tell me!
ross I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
rachel Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
ross Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
rachel Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
mr_wineburg Rachel!
rachel Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

mrs_wineburg You told me you didn't see anything.
mr_wineburg I tell ya a lot things!
mrs_wineburg Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
mr_wineburg Stay well.

rachel Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
barry Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
rachel Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
mindy Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
rachel Insane!
mindy ...from the syphilis.
rachel What?!
barry Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

phoebe Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
chandler What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
phoebe Oh, my.
chandler What?
phoebe She wants to meet you in person.
chandler Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
phoebe What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
chandler Okay, I'll do it!
phoebe Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
monica Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
richard Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
monica You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
best_man Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
all What?!
best_man What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
rachel What.
best_man No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
ross Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
rachel Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
ross Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
rachel Oh dear God.
ross Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
rachel She you in the parking lot.
ross No, Rach!
barry And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9
rachel Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I

monica Really?
richard Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
monica You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
richard But you're not.
monica Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

ross Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

chandler Oh my God!
janice OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
