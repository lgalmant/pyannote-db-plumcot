monica_geller What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah!
rachel_green Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
monica_geller Absolutely.
chandler_bing Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
chandler_bing The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
rachel_green Yeah, well, word of advice
joey_tribbiani ....Are we still talking about sex?
dr_ross_geller No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
marsha Well, she has issues.
dr_ross_geller Does she.
marsha He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
dr_ross_geller Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
marsha Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
dr_ross_geller No. No.
marsha Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
carol_willick So.
dr_ross_geller You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
carol_willick Sorry. You look good too.
dr_ross_geller Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
carol_willick A lesbian?
dr_ross_geller Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
carol_willick Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
dr_ross_geller Why- why are you here, Carol?
carol_willick I'm pregnant.
dr_ross_geller Pregnant?!
chandler_bing Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
phoebe_buffay ...Then I've already seen this one!
monica_geller Are you through with that?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
monica_geller Whose little ball of paper is this?!
chandler_bing Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
phoebe_buffay She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
monica_geller Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
chandler_bing Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
phoebe_buffay Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
monica_geller That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
chandler_bing Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
all@ Eeaagh!
rachel_green Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's beautiful.
rachel_green Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
phoebe_buffay No, look, don't touch that!
rachel_green Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
monica_geller Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Oh! Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
phoebe_buffay Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
chandler_bing You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
rachel_green I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
chandler_bing ...Dinah?
rachel_green Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
monica_geller You didn't.
rachel_green Oh, I am sorry...
monica_geller I gave you one job!
rachel_green Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
chandler_bing Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
monica_geller I just... can't do it.
chandler_bing Boys? We're going in.
dr_ross_geller .....Hi.
monica_geller Wow. That is not a happy hi.
dr_ross_geller Carol's pregnant.
phoebe_buffay Ooh! I found it!
monica_geller W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
chandler_bing Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
rachel_green Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
dr_ross_geller Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
phoebe_buffay She is so great! I miss her.
monica_geller What does she mean by 'involved'?
chandler_bing I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
dr_ross_geller Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
rachel_green So what are you gonna do?
dr_ross_geller I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
joey_tribbiani .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
judy_geller Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
monica_geller Curry.
judy_geller Mmmm!
dr_ross_geller I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
jack_geller Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
judy_geller They all had a thing for him.
dr_ross_geller Aw, Mom...
monica_geller I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
judy_geller Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
monica_geller No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
judy_geller Well, they don't have to know that...
monica_geller Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
judy_geller Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
monica_geller I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
judy_geller What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
jack_geller I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
judy_geller Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
monica_geller What's that supposed to mean?
judy_geller Nothing! It's an expression.
monica_geller No it's not.
jack_geller Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
jack_geller Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
jack_geller ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
monica_geller So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
dr_ross_geller Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
judy_geller And you knew about this?!
joey_tribbiani Your folks are really that bad, huh?
dr_ross_geller Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
monica_geller Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
dr_ross_geller Must pee.
phoebe_buffay Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
rachel_green You're twins?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
chandler_bing What does she do?
phoebe_buffay She's a waitress.
rachel_green All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
monica_geller Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
chandler_bing Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
rachel_green The lights, please..
dr_ross_geller ...How long was I in there?
rachel_green I'm just cleaning up.
dr_ross_geller D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
rachel_green Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
rachel_green Oh.. a little..
dr_ross_geller Mm-hmm..
rachel_green A lot.
dr_ross_geller Mm.
rachel_green So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
dr_ross_geller Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
rachel_green Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
dr_ross_geller Got me.
rachel_green Remember when we were in high school together?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes!
rachel_green Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
dr_ross_geller Me either...
dr_ross_geller Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
susan_bunch Hi.
carol_willick Ross, you remember Susan.
dr_ross_geller How could I forget?
susan_bunch Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
carol_willick Dr. Oberman.
dr_ross_geller ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
susan_bunch She.
dr_ross_geller -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
carol_willick Yes, and she's very supportive.
dr_ross_geller Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
carol_willick Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Quack, quack..
carol_willick Ross? That opens my cervix.
rachel_green Barry?
barry_farber C'mon in.
rachel_green Are you sure?
barry_farber Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
bobby Huh?!
barry_farber So, how ya doin?
rachel_green I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
barry_farber Yeah, well..
bernice#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode02 Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
barry_farber Be right there. Be back in a sec.
rachel_green I dumped him.
bobby Okay.
dr_ross_geller So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
carol_willick Give me a 'for instance'.
dr_ross_geller Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
carol_willick Marlon-
dr_ross_geller Marlon?!
carol_willick -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
dr_ross_geller ...As in Mouse?
carol_willick As in my grandmother.
dr_ross_geller Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
carol_willick Julia..
susan_bunch We agreed on Minnie.
dr_ross_geller 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
barry_farber Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
rachel_green Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
barry_farber Oh, that's great.
rachel_green Why are- why are you so tanned?
barry_farber Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
rachel_green Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
barry_farber No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
bobby Me?!
barry_farber No! I went with Mindy.
rachel_green Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
barry_farber Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
rachel_green Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
barry_farber Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
rachel_green And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
barry_farber Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
rachel_green Okay..
barry_farber See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
rachel_green Wow.
barry_farber You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
rachel_green What?
bobby Me.
rachel_green Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
barry_farber Well, thank you for giving it back.
bobby Hello?!
susan_bunch Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
dr_ross_geller Helen Geller? I don't think so.
carol_willick Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
carol_willick No, I mean it's not Geller.
dr_ross_geller What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
carol_willick No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
dr_ross_geller Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
susan_bunch It's my baby too.
dr_ross_geller Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
susan_bunch Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
carol_willick All right, you two, stop it!
dr_ross_geller No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
carol_willick Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
dr_ross_geller Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
susan_bunch Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
dr_ross_geller My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
dr_oberman Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
all@ Yeah. Yeah. A little.
dr_oberman Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
dr_ross_geller You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God.
susan_bunch Look at that.
carol_willick I know.
dr_ross_geller Well? Isn't that amazing?
joey_tribbiani What are we supposed to be seeing here?
chandler_bing I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
phoebe_buffay You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
dr_ross_geller Then don't do that, alright?
phoebe_buffay Okay!
dr_ross_geller Monica. Whaddya think?
monica_geller Mm-hmm.
dr_ross_geller Wh- are you welling up?
monica_geller No.
dr_ross_geller You are, you're welling up.
monica_geller Am not!
dr_ross_geller You're gonna be an aunt.
monica_geller Oh shut up!
rachel_green Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
