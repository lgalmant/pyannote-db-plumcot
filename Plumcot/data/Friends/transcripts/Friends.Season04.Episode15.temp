chandler Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
rachel Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
chandler That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
rachel Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
chandler Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
rachel Hmm.
woman OH...MY...GAWD!!
monica Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
joey Ohh, Nothing.
monica Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
joey I know what it did! Nothing.
monica They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
joey Like this.
rachel Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
joey Sure! It flushes it.
rachel Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
chandler Hello!
joey Hey! Ah!!
rachel Guess who we ran into today?!
monica Janice?!
chandler Isn't this amazing?
monica How have you been?
janice Oh well, I'm divorced.
phoebe Ohhh, wow.
janice Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
joey And there it is.
janice I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
chandler Okay. Bye.
janice Bye.
chandler Bye.
janice Bye.
chandler Bye.
janice Bye.
chandler B-bye!
janice Bye-bye.
chandler Bye. I can't stand the woman!
phoebe What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
chandler Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
joey So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
chandler Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
rachel You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
chandler Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
joey Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
emily I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
ross No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
ross Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
emily No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
devon Hey, mate.
liam How are ya man?
ross Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
emily So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
devon Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
emily Oh my God. I think you're right.
liam Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
emily Oh, Liam.
ross Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
devon We were playing rugby.
liam In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
emily Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
ross What's ah, what's so funny about that?
emily Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
ross Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so
devon So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
liam Cheers!
ross Cheers!
janice Oh boy, I just love to sing!
chandler Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
janice Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
chandler Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship
janice I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
chandler Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
janice Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
chandler I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
janice Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
chandler No! No! Not, Paris.
janice Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
chandler Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
janice When?
chandler I don't know exactly.
janice Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
chandler But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
monica Done?
phoebe Yep!
rachel Hey!
joey Hey! What's up?
monica This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
joey I bet I stopped listening before you did.
rachel Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
monica Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
rachel It's coming from Joey!
phoebe Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
phoebe Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
ross Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
joey Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
janice Hey there Ross!
ross Hey!
phoebe Janice.
chandler Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
janice Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
chandler Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
joey Hey-hey, what's going on?
chandler Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
joey Thanks for telling me!
chandler I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
joey Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
janice Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
phoebe Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
janice Okay, Chandler, come on!
chandler Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
joey Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
ross Hey, I can handle it! All right?
rachel Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
ross That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
joey Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
ross And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
joey Ross! They're gonna kill you!
phoebe Well, why are you doing this anyway?
ross Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
phoebe You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
ross Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
rachel I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
joey All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
chandler Thanks!
ross Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
all Oh!
rachel Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
joey Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
ross They don't look any bigger than me!
joey Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
emily I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
ross All right.
emily Okay.
phoebe Hi.
phoebe Whoa! I kinda liked it.
ross Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
joey I totally don't know what you're talking about.
ross Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
joey No.
ross You'll see.
emily Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
liam You don't say!
emily Good luck, babe.
liam Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
liam Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
ross JOEY!!!!!!
rachel You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
monica He asked you out?!
rachel No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
monica Saucy!
rachel What are these?
monica Electrical plans for the building.
rachel Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
monica I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
rachel Wow! If only more people knew.
chandler Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
janice Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
chandler Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
janice On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
chandler Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
ticket_counter_attendant One ticket to Yemen?
chandler Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
ticket_counter_attendant I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
chandler What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
ticket_counter_attendant Are you travelling with a child?
chandler No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
ticket_counter_attendant Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
janice What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
chandler American Express?
emily I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
phoebe No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so
emily That's just halftime, there's more of this.
ross Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
emily Right.
ross Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
emily Okay.
ross Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
phoebe Oh, poor baby.
ross Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
emily Ross, they are killing you out there!
ross That's not true!
phoebe She's right! You have to stop!
ross What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
joey Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
ross I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
emily All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
ross No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
emily No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
ross I like that.
emily Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
ross Huh?
emily One swift kick and he'll back off.
ross All right, bad ankle, got it!
emily And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
ross Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
emily And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
ross But-but, Liam's on my team.
emily I don't care! You just get him!
ross I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
joey The Red Ross! Okay.
rachel Hey!
monica Hi!
rachel What-what are-what are these?
monica Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
monica No-no-no, no!
monica I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
rachel Oh my God! Look at this!
monica Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
rachel I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
monica I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
rachel And did you?!
monica No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
monica But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
rachel Oh my God.
mrs_chatracus Hello darling.
rachel Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
phoebe Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
ross Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
joey Yeah, sure.
ross No, not you.
joey Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
phoebe Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
emily You were amazing out there.
ross Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
emily Oh my God!
ross I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
emily You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
ross Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
emily I think you've got concussion.
ross No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
emily You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
ross It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
ticket_counter_attendant This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
chandler Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
janice Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
chandler Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
janice Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
chandler Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
janice Chandler?
chandler No!
janice Chandler!
chandler Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
janice No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
chandler Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
monica All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
rachel Thank God.
monica I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
phoebe See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
