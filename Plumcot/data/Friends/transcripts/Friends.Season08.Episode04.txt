rachel_green Hi!
all@ Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hello!
rachel_green Welcome home.
dr_ross_geller So, how was the honeymoon?
monica_geller It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
rachel_green Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
monica_geller Oh great!
chandler_bing Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
monica_geller All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
phoebe_buffay Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
rachel_green Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
joey_tribbiani You're welcome buddy.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, thanks.
rachel_green And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
dr_ross_geller Umm that's...that's a little misleading.
rachel_green What is?
dr_ross_geller The lie you just told.
rachel_green That-that you came on to me?
dr_ross_geller There's the one!
rachel_green But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
dr_ross_geller Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
joey_tribbiani Whom. That's right.
rachel_green You know you kissed me first.
dr_ross_geller What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
rachel_green I was sending you signals?
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
rachel_green Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
rachel_green Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
rachel_green No please, show me how I begged you!
dr_ross_geller I can show you, I have it on videotape! It's an expression.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
chandler_bing Y'know who has a great video camera?
phoebe_buffay Greg and Jenny?
monica_geller Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
chandler_bing Let's call 'em.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
monica_geller Hello? Eighth street deli?
joey_tribbiani Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
monica_geller Uh sorry, wrong number.
chandler_bing Here you go.
monica_geller Hello? It's the deli again!
joey_tribbiani All right! I'll have a sandwich!
monica_geller I don't think this number's right!
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay You got fake numbered.
monica_geller What?! People don't do that!
joey_tribbiani Oh I think we do.
monica_geller They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
chandler_bing I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
monica_geller And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
joey_tribbiani Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
dr_ross_geller Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
phoebe_buffay Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
dr_ross_geller Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
phoebe_buffay That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
dr_ross_geller Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
joey_tribbiani Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
dr_ross_geller About...about sex? That I hadn't had sex in months?
joey_tribbiani Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
joey_tribbiani Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
dr_ross_geller I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, for like months?
dr_ross_geller Five to be lying, six.
joey_tribbiani Six months? Whoa that's rough.
dr_ross_geller Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
joey_tribbiani The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
dr_ross_geller Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!
joey_tribbiani Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
dr_ross_geller Really? Well then tell it to me.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
dr_ross_geller I'll try to control myself.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe
dr_ross_geller You were backpacking across Western Europe?
joey_tribbiani Have a nice six more months Ross!
dr_ross_geller Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
joey_tribbiani I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying
dr_ross_geller Why?
kristen Umm, this is great wine.
dr_ross_geller It's from France...In Europe...Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
kristen Really?
dr_ross_geller Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
kristen I studied for a year in Barcelona.
dr_ross_geller Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
kristen I love hiking!
dr_ross_geller Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
kristen I think its Tibidabo.
dr_ross_geller Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
joey_tribbiani Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
dr_ross_geller Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
dr_ross_geller No! No, I don't...don't want to.
joey_tribbiani How long since you've seen a girl naked?
dr_ross_geller I was backpacking across Western Europe.
joey_tribbiani I'm not feeling it.
dr_ross_geller I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
joey_tribbiani No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
dr_ross_geller It's been six months! I'm always hot!
joey_tribbiani Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
dr_ross_geller I'll try that.
joey_tribbiani All right now... All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
joey_tribbiani Good luck.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.
joey_tribbiani That means a lot to me man.
dr_ross_geller Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel!
rachel_green Oh Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
dr_ross_geller That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
dr_ross_geller So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything.
chandler_bing Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
monica_geller Yeah, definitely.
dr_ross_geller What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
joey_tribbiani Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
dr_ross_geller Thank you. No!
joey_tribbiani You're right.
dr_ross_geller Joey! No!
joey_tribbiani Loud and clear!
monica_geller I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
monica_geller Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
phoebe_buffay Regina Philange.
chandler_bing I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
monica_geller I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
chandler_bing I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
monica_geller Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
chandler_bing Well maybe it was all of your questions.
monica_geller What about my questions?
chandler_bing The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?
chandler_bing Was that another question?
rachel_green Hey! Is Ross still here?
joey_tribbiani Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
rachel_green Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
dr_ross_geller Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
rachel_green Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
monica_geller Hell yeah!!!
rachel_green I am not gonna show you this!
phoebe_buffay No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
dr_ross_geller Forget it, she's destroying it.
phoebe_buffay Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
dr_ross_geller Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
rachel_green I wanna see it.
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
joey_tribbiani Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
dr_ross_geller I don't want people to see it for your sake.
rachel_green Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
dr_ross_geller Rachel, please
rachel_green Ah, a little preview!
dr_ross_geller Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying
rachel_green Okay, here we go.
dr_ross_geller Hello! Can I get you anything?
joey_tribbiani I'm so happy!
rachel_green Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
rachel_green There I am.
phoebe_buffay You're gonna get pregnant.
rachel_green I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I
dr_ross_geller You didn't do it?
rachel_green I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
monica_geller Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
rachel_green Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
monica_geller I know.
rachel_green I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh
chandler_bing Did you do it on our invitations?!
dr_ross_geller Not on the ones we sent out.
chandler_bing So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
rachel_green Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
dr_ross_geller I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost
rachel_green Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
dr_ross_geller I mean I...I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
rachel_green Oh I wanted to.
dr_ross_geller So we...we both wanted to.
rachel_green Interesting.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
rachel_green Oh yeah, sure.
rachel_green Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
dr_ross_geller And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
rachel_green Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
rachel_green Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you came on to Ross!
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Now I'm so happy.
rachel_green What are you talking about?!
monica_geller You used the Europe story!
chandler_bing That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
rachel_green How do you know about that story?!
joey_tribbiani How do you know about that story?!
rachel_green I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
joey_tribbiani Some guy!!
rachel_green No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
joey_tribbiani Ken Adams!!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
rachel_green It was an amazing night.
dr_ross_geller It was. It was an amazing night.
rachel_green You think it looked amazing?
dr_ross_geller I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
rachel_green Yeah, me neither. Yet
dr_ross_geller Uhhhhhh...that-that may be weird.
rachel_green Yeah, it would be really weird.
dr_ross_geller Good luck.
rachel_green Good luck to you.
