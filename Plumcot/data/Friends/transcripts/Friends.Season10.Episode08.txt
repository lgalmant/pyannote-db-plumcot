monica_geller Hey guys!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller We need to talk to you about something.
chandler_bing Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
all@ What?
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding?
chandler_bing Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
dr_ross_geller That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
chandler_bing No, no! We made this decision together.
dr_ross_geller She's putting words in your mouth!
joey_tribbiani Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
rachel_green I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
monica_geller No, it's not!
rachel_green It's not? When was she born?
phoebe_buffay Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
monica_geller Thank you, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
monica_geller What? You are way off, lady!
phoebe_buffay Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
monica_geller That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
chandler_bing Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
monica_geller Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
chandler_bing We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
monica_geller You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
phoebe_buffay You're not making the pies yourself?
monica_geller No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
rachel_green Did you at least win the contest?
monica_geller 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
rachel_green Can't wait!
monica_geller This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach.
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay What's Emma doing today?
rachel_green Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
phoebe_buffay Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
rachel_green Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
phoebe_buffay Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
rachel_green Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
phoebe_buffay Oh... okay.
rachel_green Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
rachel_green And a thousand dollars.
rachel_green ..is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
phoebe_buffay Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
rachel_green Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
phoebe_buffay Well, I was thinking...
rachel_green Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
monica_geller Did someone drop the baton again?
chandler_bing Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
monica_geller I don't get older. I just get better!
chandler_bing You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
monica_geller You don't know that.
chandler_bing Somebody is gonna pick us.
monica_geller Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
chandler_bing I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
monica_geller Name one of his books.
chandler_bing "The Firm"?
monica_geller Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
chandler_bing You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
monica_geller Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
chandler_bing I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
monica_geller Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
chandler_bing Tell me more.
monica_geller Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
chandler_bing You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
dr_ross_geller Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
joey_tribbiani Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
dr_ross_geller Dude, I wanted him to guess.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, they're great seats too!
dr_ross_geller Guess where they are?
joey_tribbiani Center ice.
dr_ross_geller Did I do something to you?
chandler_bing Hmm, the game's at one.
dr_ross_geller So?
chandler_bing Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
joey_tribbiani So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
chandler_bing You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
joey_tribbiani Dude, two times that happened!
chandler_bing Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
dr_ross_geller He's right, man.
joey_tribbiani Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
chandler_bing Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
joey_tribbiani That's some gentle comedy, dude.
dr_ross_geller We're still going at the game, right?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
host#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode08 This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
phoebe_buffay Hey.
rachel_green Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
phoebe_buffay We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
rachel_green Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
rachel_green Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
phoebe_buffay But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
rachel_green Phoebe, you have to calm down.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
rachel_green Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green You heard them say that?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
phoebe_buffay Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
rachel_green No, what?
phoebe_buffay Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
rachel_green No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
phoebe_buffay Why not!
rachel_green Because I already did!
joey_tribbiani Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
dr_ross_geller Oh! What a game, huh?
joey_tribbiani I know, yeah.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
joey_tribbiani Ohhhh! These seats are great!
dr_ross_geller I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
joey_tribbiani Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
dr_ross_geller Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
joey_tribbiani I don't know...
dr_ross_geller One more fight!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
monica_geller Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
chandler_bing I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
joey_tribbiani How late are we?
dr_ross_geller Forty-five minutes.
joey_tribbiani Wow
dr_ross_geller Here!
joey_tribbiani Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
dr_ross_geller You may want to lose the foam finger!
joey_tribbiani Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Oh!
joey_tribbiani You are not at Thanksgiving?
rachel_green No...
phoebe_buffay No, we're late!
rachel_green What are you doing here!
dr_ross_geller We're late too!
joey_tribbiani We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
phoebe_buffay Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
dr_ross_geller So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, where were you!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
phoebe_buffay Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
rachel_green And I won!
dr_ross_geller You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
rachel_green Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
dr_ross_geller Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
rachel_green Yeah. That's me!
dr_ross_geller You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
phoebe_buffay And it looks like she put makeup on her!
joey_tribbiani Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
rachel_green She won a thousand dollars!
dr_ross_geller So this is an annual thing?
joey_tribbiani Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
phoebe_buffay You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. What are we gonna do?
rachel_green Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
joey_tribbiani All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
phoebe_buffay Alright, what are we gonna say?
dr_ross_geller Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
phoebe_buffay Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
joey_tribbiani No. Here
dr_ross_geller HEY!
monica_geller Do you hear something?
chandler_bing They're out there!
monica_geller Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
chandler_bing Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
monica_geller Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
chandler_bing Ross' shirt is torn.
monica_geller Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
rachel_green Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
dr_ross_geller I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
phoebe_buffay We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
dr_ross_geller That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
rachel_green You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
dr_ross_geller We know you're out there.
joey_tribbiani Who do you think its from?
rachel_green Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
dr_ross_geller Well, let's just go in there and face them.
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
joey_tribbiani I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
rachel_green Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready?
joey_tribbiani Ah-haah! I win!!
dr_ross_geller What is that?
joey_tribbiani That's fire. Beats everything.
phoebe_buffay Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?
joey_tribbiani Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
rachel_green Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
all@ Alright, okay.
phoebe_buffay It's locked.
dr_ross_geller Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
rachel_green Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
monica_geller No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
chandler_bing Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
monica_geller Nothing. It's fine.
chandler_bing Oh thank God!
dr_ross_geller Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
chandler_bing That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
dr_ross_geller FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
rachel_green You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
joey_tribbiani I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
monica_geller That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
dr_ross_geller How are we gonna decide who gets this?
joey_tribbiani WATER BALLOON!
phoebe_buffay What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
rachel_green Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah!
monica_geller Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
chandler_bing Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
rachel_green Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
dr_ross_geller That's worse than no food.
chandler_bing HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
monica_geller Stinky?!
chandler_bing Please let me stay on this side of the door.
rachel_green Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
phoebe_buffay Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
rachel_green You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
joey_tribbiani Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
dr_ross_geller I don't know...
joey_tribbiani I'm telling ya... I can do it.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, he can do it!
rachel_green Oh!
joey_tribbiani Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
chandler_bing The cranberries...?
monica_geller Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
joey_tribbiani Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
chandler_bing He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
joey_tribbiani Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
dr_ross_geller I feel terrible.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green So, so sorry.
joey_tribbiani Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
chandler_bing The floating heads do make a good point.
monica_geller Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
rachel_green So bad.
dr_ross_geller So bad.
phoebe_buffay So bad.
monica_geller Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
rachel_green Dessert?
monica_geller Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
phoebe_buffay Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize Here!
monica_geller Grand Supreme Little Darling?
rachel_green Congratulatioooons!
monica_geller Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
dr_ross_geller Really girls, not cool.
chandler_bing Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
joey_tribbiani Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
dr_ross_geller It's a day to be thankful.
joey_tribbiani Don't make me come up there!
monica_geller It's too late for apologies.
joey_tribbiani Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
chandler_bing That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
rachel_green Ewww, is that what that is?
joey_tribbiani Sorry!
phoebe_buffay Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
rachel_green Yeah! I'll cook!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Let's go out.
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
monica_geller The three of us?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
joey_tribbiani Ha!
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
monica_geller Joey, that is not gonna work.
joey_tribbiani No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
phoebe_buffay I'll pull you through.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
chandler_bing A little late for that.
joey_tribbiani Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
monica_geller Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
chandler_bing Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
monica_geller Bring it.
joey_tribbiani I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
monica_geller Here you go!
joey_tribbiani Oh, that smells good!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
monica_geller Okay, try it.
joey_tribbiani It isn't working.
monica_geller Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
joey_tribbiani Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
chandler_bing Can you ever feel your ears?
joey_tribbiani Interesting...
monica_geller Chandler, where are your tools?
chandler_bing Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
monica_geller I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
rachel_green I lent them to Ross.
dr_ross_geller I gave them to Joey.
joey_tribbiani I left them at the park.
monica_geller Oh!
dr_ross_geller I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
phoebe_buffay I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
dr_ross_geller Nice!
monica_geller Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
joey_tribbiani It's really starting to hurt.
chandler_bing Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
phoebe_buffay Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
joey_tribbiani Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
chandler_bing Come on guys, PUSH!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Come on!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
chandler_bing My cranberries!
joey_tribbiani Man, I've got food all over me.
chandler_bing Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
chandler_bing Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
monica_geller I don't care.
chandler_bing What's going on?
monica_geller That was the adoption agency...
chandler_bing And?
monica_geller WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
chandler_bing Are you serious?
monica_geller There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
rachel_green I'm so happy for you!
monica_geller This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
rachel_green To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
dr_ross_geller I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
phoebe_buffay I know. Have you considered pageanting?
monica_geller I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I know how you feel...
rachel_green Really?
joey_tribbiani Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
chandler_bing That is the exact same thing.
