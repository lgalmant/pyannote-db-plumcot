phoebe_buffay Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
joey_tribbiani Thursday? But that's Halloween.
phoebe_buffay So?
joey_tribbiani So spooky, that's all.
dr_ross_geller So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
phoebe_buffay No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
rachel_green Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?
phoebe_buffay Oh, Rachel!
dr_ross_geller Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yay!
dr_ross_geller Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
phoebe_buffay Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
monica_geller What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
rachel_green Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
monica_geller Oh, dear god!
chandler_bing Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
ken That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
chandler_bing Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
claudia I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
chandler_bing No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
claudia Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?
chandler_bing Alright, lo'look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
ken That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke '
chandler_bing Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
ken I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?
chandler_bing I always liked you, Ken.
phoebe_buffay Trick or treat!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, and treat it is.
monica_geller Hmhmm.
phoebe_buffay Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
monica_geller This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
phoebe_buffay Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
monica_geller Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
phoebe_buffay 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey'hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
chandler_bing Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
phoebe_buffay You smoked!
chandler_bing No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
phoebe_buffay Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
chandler_bing Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound and the breasts of a Greek goddess.

monica_geller Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
chandler_bing No thanks, I'm good.
monica_geller O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
chandler_bing Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
monica_geller You don't need a shower.

dr_ross_geller Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
rachel_green Oh my god, I left the water running.
dr_ross_geller Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
rachel_green Ah, did I leave the stove on?
dr_ross_geller You never cooked since 1996.
rachel_green Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
dr_ross_geller Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ' listen, listen!
rachel_green Ubb.
dr_ross_geller A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
rachel_green Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
the_waiter Hello.
joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay Hey.
the_waiter It's been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.
joey_tribbiani Maybe we should just eat now.
the_waiter You can't order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.
joey_tribbiani Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?
the_waiter Estrangement
joey_tribbiani But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe_buffay No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
joey_tribbiani If you ask me to stay, I'll pee.
the_maitre_d Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss!
phoebe_buffay Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.
joey_tribbiani Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell'uhuhh!
monica_geller Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
chandler_bing Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
monica_geller Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral
chandler_bing That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
monica_geller No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
chandler_bing Mean it?
monica_geller Yah.
chandler_bing You are incredible. Unless, I-I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
monica_geller D'you want to?

dr_ross_geller Great. So let's get going?
rachel_green Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
judy_geller I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: 'Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you.'
dr_ross_geller Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
chandler_bing Uhh. You are welcome.
monica_geller You know what? Let's not talk.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
chandler_bing But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes'no big deal.
monica_geller Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
chandler_bing Leave it.
monica_geller I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
chandler_bing You tricked me to get me into bed?
monica_geller That's right, I got mine.
chandler_bing I feel so used.
phoebe_buffay Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?
joey_tribbiani Thank you. Waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails.
the_waiter Er'does not.
phoebe_buffay Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
the_waiter Oh, they're both exclus...
phoebe_buffay Both it is, thank you.
joey_tribbiani Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Hey, hi, hi!
the_waiter I'll just wait to put your order in.
phoebe_buffay You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
dr_ross_geller I'm so sorry '
rachel_green We got locked out of the apartment, we.
joey_tribbiani That's a great story'can I eat it?
dr_ross_geller And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
rachel_green N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
phoebe_buffay And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
rachel_green Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green She spit up. Judy! She spi Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. Oh.
rachel_green Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
joey_tribbiani Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
dr_ross_geller Y'know this ??? is incredible.
joey_tribbiani Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
rachel_green Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
joey_tribbiani And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because - monica Happy birthday!
joey_tribbiani Son of a bitch!
phoebe_buffay Wher-where have you been?
monica_geller Well, we had a little fight.
chandler_bing I would never lie to get someone into bed.
monica_geller You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
chandler_bing I suppose that Monica will have the manipulative shrew.
the_waiter I'll give you another minute.
joey_tribbiani Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
dr_ross_geller Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
rachel_green Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
chandler_bing You mean the lully story?
dr_ross_geller Huh-huh, they already know it.
phoebe_buffay You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
joey_tribbiani No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
monica_geller Why would you do that?
joey_tribbiani Chandler, control your woman!
rachel_green Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ' to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
phoebe_buffay Aw ' what?
rachel_green N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
monica_geller Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
rachel_green Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
phoebe_buffay 's a good toast.
rachel_green Could you please get her attention?
dr_ross_geller W-oa ' Mommy!
phoebe_buffay Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
dr_ross_geller Well, ??? think that's us?
phoebe_buffay well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?
joey_tribbiani Well, what is going on with you two?
monica_geller Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
monica_geller Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
chandler_bing You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
joey_tribbiani So? Did have sex, right?
chandler_bing What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
phoebe_buffay Okay, that was Mike.
rachel_green Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
phoebe_buffay Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t'not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.
rachel_green Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
dr_ross_geller You know, I think that's a good idea'our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys.
monica_geller Bye.
joey_tribbiani See ya. Well, this is just us.
chandler_bing@monica_geller Mhum.
monica_geller So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
chandler_bing So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
joey_tribbiani Do, do you gonna do it now?
monica_geller We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct.
joey_tribbiani No-ohoh.
the_maitre_d I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
joey_tribbiani Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
