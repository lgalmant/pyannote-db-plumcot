chandler Hey
joey Hey. So where's Mon?
chandler Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
joey And you're not helping?
chandler I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
ross Hey you guys!
joey_and_chandler Hey! Happy birthday..
rachel Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
ross Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly Molly, Chandler, Joey.
joey_and_chandler Hi.
molly Hi.
ross Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
joey You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
rachel Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
molly No, you stay, I'll do it
rachel OK, thank you.
molly Nice to meet you guys
joey Yeah, you too.
rachel Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
ross Yeah.
chandler Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
rachel What? You really think she's hot?
chandler Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
rachel And Joey?
joey How do you think she's doing?
rachel Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
ross Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I...
rachel Thank you!
chandler Now that Rachel's gone?
rachel So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
phoebe Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
mike Lima.
phoebe No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
mike You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". Oh god! Oh!
phoebe What?
mike OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
phoebe Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
mike What, is he your pet rat?
phoebe Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
mike You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
phoebe What are those?
mike I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
phoebe OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
mike Thank you.
phoebe So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.
rachel Hello.
gavin Hello
rachel Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
gavin For what?
rachel Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious..
gavin Is this your first appology?
rachel No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
heather Good morning!
rachel Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy.. I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
gavin What?
rachel I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
gavin I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
rachel Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
gavin Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
rachel Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
gavin I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
rachel That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
gavin Huh. What's Tag's last name?
rachel It was.. oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
gavin But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
rachel Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous.. Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
gavin It was Jones.
rachel Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
joey Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
molly You mean, when you were a baby.
joey Sure.
monica Would you stop staring at her?
chandler I wasn't staring. I was leering.
monica What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
ross Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
chandler Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
monica Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
molly I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
ross Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou..
molly Bye
monica They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
molly I think it's sweet.
ross_joey_and_chandler Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
rachel Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
joey Why not?
rachel Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
joey So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.
ross Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
joey Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
ross What are you, a child?
joey Yes!
ross Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
joey Fine.
monica Take me home!
phoebe Hey Mikey
mike Hey P
phoebe What are you doing?
mike Setting rat traps.
phoebe To kill Bob??
mike No, no, to test his neck strength.
phoebe No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
mike Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
phoebe I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
mike Better think of a new name for him.
phoebe I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
mike I don't know, I mean I'm not sure.
phoebe Oh my god, we killed Bob!
mike Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
phoebe Suzie?
ross Whazzup??
chandler Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
ross Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
chandler You don't trust him?
ross Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
chandler Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
ross You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
chandler Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
ross Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
chandler Picturing that tree?
ross I am, yes.
chandler Where you going, Joe?
joey For a walk.
chandler Oh. You mind if I join you?
joey Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
chandler Your thoughts? Plural?
joey Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
chandler I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
joey Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like.. like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.. Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
chandler Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
joey Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
chandler Great novels?
joey Fine.. mediocre porn
gavin Gavin Mitchelle's office.
rachel Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh.. ok then.. I'll pass you back to your son
gavin Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary.
rachel Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
gavin Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes?
rachel If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
gavin Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. Man, I really bug you, don't I?
rachel Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
monica Hey Rach!
rachel Hi!
monica Ready for your birthday lunch?
rachel Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
gavin Pleased to meet you.
monica Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
rachel Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
gavin Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
rachel Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
monica You were just being so nice to him!
rachel I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
rachel Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
monica Right there! That was so fake!
rachel Shh!
rachel I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
monica Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
rachel God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
monica Does he?
rachel What?
monica Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
rachel Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
molly She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
rachel Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
monica Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
joey Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
rachel Yeah, sure!
joey Oh.. Happy birth.. oh, see you later
monica Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
rachel Oh, give me!
phoebe Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
mike Yeah. We have rat babies now.
rachel Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
monica So this is what a stroke feels like.
phoebe I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
rachel Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
phoebe No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
rachel whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
phoebe Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
ross Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
chandler I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
ross We have to stop them before something happens!
chandler Right behind you, big guy!
joey So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
molly So where did you study?
joey Oh, I didn't go to college.
molly No, where did you study acting?
joey Molly.. people don't study acting..
ross Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
molly Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
ross Thanx.
joey Will the stable boy never get the princess??
ross What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
joey No.. the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
ross_and_chandler Come on! Joe!
joey Ok
woman Hi, is Molly here?
ross Yeah, come on in. Molly?
molly Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha I'll see you tomorrow.
ross Ok.. Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
joey It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
phoebe Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
mike Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
phoebe Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
mike Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
phoebe Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
mike Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
phoebe No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like.. That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
mike Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
phoebe Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
mike It's gonna be ok.
phoebe You must think I'm crazy.
mike No, I think you're sweet.
phoebe Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to.. let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from.. when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
monica Hey!
rachel Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
monica No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
rachel Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
monica Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up
rachel Mmm hmm.
gavin Yeah, hey.
monica Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
rachel No.
gavin Nice party.
rachel Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at. 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame..
monica Again, you're welcome.
gavin Look, I'll just give you this and go.
rachel Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
gavin Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I.. got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
rachel Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card "From Gavin"
gavin I really mean it.
rachel Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
gavin You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!
rachel See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
gavin I'm not sure.
rachel Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
gavin I do have feelings for you.
rachel You do?
gavin Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
rachel See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you.. and you do that..
chandler First I was afraid, I was petrified
phoebe Hey
chandler Hi
phoebe Listen, I think I've left something here.
chandler Oh, well someone left this This is yours?
phoebe No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
chandler Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
monica Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
phoebe Ooh, maybe that's him!
