joey Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
rachel Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
joey Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
monica Joey we know you steal our food.
chandler I'm good.
monica Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
rachel Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
chandler Is that a swing?
rachel Oh don't even ask!
chandler Yuck!
joey I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
chandler That was like 5 years ago.
joey Yeah you got 5 years left!
chandler Joey
joey You wanna make it 6?!
rachel Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
ross Hey!
rachel I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
ross Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
rachel Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
ross I guess so.
rachel So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
ross No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
rachel Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
ross Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
rachel Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
ross Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
rachel She asked-asked you out again?
ross Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
rachel Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
ross Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
rachel Thank you. I...yeah.
ross I mean after tomorrow night.
rachel No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
ross Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
rachel Ross thanks.
ross You want me to call her right now?
rachel Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
ross Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
rachel Yeah do it now, call right now.
monica This is my favorite part.
phoebe Yeah me too.
phoebe Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
chandler Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
joey You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
chandler Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
monica Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
chandler I'm not macho.
monica Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
chandler No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
joey Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
chandler I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
joey Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
chandler Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
monica Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
phoebe All right, what's going on there?
chandler Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
monica Where were your parents?
chandler Oh they didn't want to come!
phoebe Oh Chandler!
monica Poor thing!
phoebe So that story doesn't make you cry?
chandler No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
joey No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
the_fan Excuse me.
phoebe Yeah?
the_fan Are you Phoebe Buffay?
phoebe Yeah.
the_fan Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
phoebe Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
the_fan Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
phoebe You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
joey So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
the_fan I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
joey Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
the_fan Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
joey Movies?
the_fan That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
joey I don't think so.
the_fan No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
joey Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
gunther Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
jill Hey!
rachel Hey!
jill You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
rachel Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
jill Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
rachel It's not random, it's Bob.
jill It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
rachel No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
jill You asked him too?!
rachel Hm-mmm.
jill Why?!
rachel Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history
jill I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
rachel No.
jill You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
rachel Y'know Bob in Human Resources
jill Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
rachel Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just
jill Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
rachel I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
jill Why are you so jealous of me?
rachel Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
jill Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
rachel All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
jill Who?!
rachel In Human Resources!!!!!!
rachel ...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
monica You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
rachel Do I have my own castle?
ross Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
rachel No.
monica Oh great! Did you get a movie?
joey Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
chandler You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
joey Sort of
monica Guys, what's going on?
joey Phoebe's a porn star!
all What?!!
chandler Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
rachel Oh my God!
monica That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
joey Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
ross And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
rachel Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
monica This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
chandler Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
monica Yes, but you are dead inside.
joey All right well, I'd better take that back.
monica Wh-what, why?
joey We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
monica Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
rachel Absolutely not.
monica Y'know maybe a little bit!
rachel Probably just the first half.
joey No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
ross Yeah! Good for you Joe!
joey Yeah.
buffay_the_vampire_layer Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
the_vampire Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
buffay_the_vampire_layer Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
monica Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
chandler Her ankle is what you're watching?
rachel Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
chandler She's just doing her job!
joey You sick bastards!
rachel Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
joey Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
phoebe Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
monica Hey sweetie!
chandler Hey!
monica Chicken Soup for the Soul?
chandler There's no back to this couch!
monica Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
chandler Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
monica Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
chandler Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
monica Stop it!
chandler No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
monica I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
chandler Yeah?
monica Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
chandler Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
monica And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
chandler Aww, I love you so
monica What is wrong with you?!!!
chandler What?!
monica What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
chandler So you didn't mean any of that?!
monica No you robot!!
ross You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
jill Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
ross Of course, what happened?
jill I don't want to talk about it.
ross Okay, umm
jill But you know what might really cheer me up?
ross What?
jill Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
ross Wow! Really?!
jill Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
ross Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
jill Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
ross Ohh!
rachel Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
monica No, I haven't.
rachel Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
ursula Who is it?
phoebe It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
ursula Hey!
phoebe Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
ursula No I'm not.
mans_voice We're still rolling!
phoebe You're making one right now!
another_mans_voice Let's go Phoebe!
phoebe And-and you're using my name!
ursula Yeah, can I help you with something?
same_mans_voice Phoebe, come on!
phoebe Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
ursula Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
phoebe What?!
ursula Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
phoebe No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
ross Slides are almost ready.
jill Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
ross Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
jill Oh great!
ross Hello?
rachel What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
ross O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
rachel Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
ross So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
rachel Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
ross Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
jill So?
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey!
phoebe So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
joey Oh no, not you too!
phoebe No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
joey Nice!
phoebe Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
joey That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
phoebe Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
joey You do?
phoebe Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
joey Yeah.
chandler Hey.
ross You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
rachel Oh! I knew it! What happened?
ross Umm, she kissed me.
rachel What?! You kissed!
chandler Maybe we should give them some privacy.
monica Shhhh!!!
ross Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
rachel Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
ross Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
rachel Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
ross Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
rachel Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
ross Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
rachel What?!
ross No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
rachel Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
ross You're welcome.
monica Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
chandler I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
jill All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
rachel Yeah, I got that.
jill And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
ross You take care Jill.
jill Okay, see ya!
rachel Bye-bye-e!
monica Bye.
chandler I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
