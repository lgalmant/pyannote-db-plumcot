rachel_green Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
chandler_bing You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
phoebe_buffay The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
dr_ross_geller Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
joey_tribbiani Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
rachel_green God. I feel violated.
monica_geller Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
chandler_bing Ross, ten o'clock.
dr_ross_geller Is it? Feels like two.
chandler_bing No, ten o'clock.
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
dr_ross_geller Oh. Hel-lo!
chandler_bing She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
monica_geller Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
rachel_green Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
chandler_bing Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
dr_ross_geller He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
chandler_bing Thank you, buddy.
phoebe_buffay Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
monica_geller You could do that!
chandler_bing Y'think?
all@ Yeah!
chandler_bing Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
dr_ross_geller C'mon! C'mon!
chandler_bing Here goes.
aurora ...Yes?
chandler_bing Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.
aurora Yes, you said that.
chandler_bing Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
aurora Chandler?
all@ Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
joey_tribbiani Whadja think?
all@ ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
joey_tribbiani C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
all@ Saw your head. Saw your head.
chandler_bing She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
rachel_green What is it?
joey_tribbiani The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
phoebe_buffay Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
chandler_bing Hey, kids.
all@ Hey.
phoebe_buffay No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
chandler_bing Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
monica_geller Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
chandler_bing It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
aurora ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
chandler_bing Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
chandler_bing We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
aurora ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
chandler_bing Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
aurora 'We' would be me and Rick.
joey_tribbiani Who's Rick?
chandler_bing Who's Rick?
aurora My husband.
all@ Ooooohhh.
chandler_bing Oh, so you're divorced?
aurora No.
chandler_bing Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
aurora No, I'm still married.
chandler_bing So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
aurora Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
chandler_bing Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
aurora Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
all@ What?!
chandler_bing So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
aurora I suppose mainly sexual.
chandler_bing ...Hm.
monica_geller Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
chandler_bing What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
monica_geller Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
chandler_bing Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
dr_ross_geller No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
monica_geller What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
joey_tribbiani I couldn't do it.
monica_geller Good for you, Joey.
joey_tribbiani When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
dr_ross_geller Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
dr_ross_geller Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
monica_geller We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
all@ Yeah! C'mon!
dr_ross_geller Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
rachel_green Tah-daaah!
chandler_bing Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
rachel_green Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
rachel_green Well, whaddya think?
all@ Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
monica_geller ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
all@ Uh-oh...
monica_geller How-how did that happen?
rachel_green I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
monica_geller Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
chandler_bing Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
monica_geller You guys, I am not that bad!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
monica_geller That is so unfair!
dr_ross_geller Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
monica_geller Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
dr_ross_geller Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
monica_geller Why not?
dr_ross_geller Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
monica_geller I could do that.
rachel_green Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
monica_geller Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
chandler_bing Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
monica_geller STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
dr_ross_geller Monica? You're Mom.
phoebe_buffay Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
joey_tribbiani Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
all@ Oh my God! Whoah!
monica_geller Well, what's the part?
joey_tribbiani Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
phoebe_buffay Seriously, what-what's the part?
joey_tribbiani "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
dr_ross_geller C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
joey_tribbiani ...I'm his
rachel_green ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
joey_tribbiani ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
monica_geller Oh my God.
joey_tribbiani C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
chandler_bing Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
joey_tribbiani Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
dr_ross_geller You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
monica_geller Alright, alright, alright...
joey_tribbiani Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
monica_geller For what?
joey_tribbiani Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
monica_geller Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
joey_tribbiani Thank you!
chandler_bing Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
monica_geller He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
chandler_bing C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
monica_geller I warned you...
rachel_green Who is being loud?
chandler_bing Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
monica_geller Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
chandler_bing Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
rachel_green Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
chandler_bing No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
monica_geller Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
director ...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
joey_tribbiani Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
director Lose the robe.
joey_tribbiani Me?
director That would work.
joey_tribbiani Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
director Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
director And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm- I'm showering.
director No, that was clenching.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
director I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
joey_tribbiani I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
chandler_bing God, I love these fingers...
aurora Thank you.
chandler_bing No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
aurora Oh my God, I'm late.
chandler_bing Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
aurora Okay.
chandler_bing Don't go.
aurora Okay. Oh no, I have to.
chandler_bing Too bad, she's leaving.
aurora I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
chandler_bing Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
aurora It's not Rick.
chandler_bing What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
aurora No, it's-it's Andrew.
chandler_bing I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
aurora He's... new.
chandler_bing Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
aurora No, that's not exactly what I was..
chandler_bing Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
aurora So what do you want?
chandler_bing You.
aurora You have me!
chandler_bing Nono, just you.
aurora Whaddyou mean?
chandler_bing Lose the other guys.
aurora ...Like, ...all of them?
chandler_bing C'mon, we're great together, why not?
aurora Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
chandler_bing ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
aurora So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
chandler_bing I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
aurora Which one?
chandler_bing ...The second guy.
aurora Well, call me if you change your mind.
chandler_bing Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
dr_ross_geller Look at it this way
all@ Hey!
monica_geller Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
joey_tribbiani Nope.
dr_ross_geller No? What happened, big guy?
chandler_bing "Big guy?"
dr_ross_geller It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
joey_tribbiani I got fired.
all@ Oh!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
rachel_green Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
joey_tribbiani My mom will.
chandler_bing Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
monica_geller Maybe this wasn't your shot.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
joey_tribbiani Hard to tell, I was naked.
phoebe_buffay No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
joey_tribbiani Yeah? That's so nice!
monica_geller I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
all@ Night.
rachel_green Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
monica_geller Uh-huh!
rachel_green Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
monica_geller Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
dr_ross_geller She is a kook.
monica_geller If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
