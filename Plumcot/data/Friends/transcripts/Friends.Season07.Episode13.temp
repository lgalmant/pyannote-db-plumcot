joey Hey.
rachel Hey.
joey What are you doing?
rachel Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
joey Why would you want to do that?
rachel So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
joey Rach, there is a decent place to
rachel And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
joey No. No. No.
rachel No?
joey No. Rosita does not move.
rachel I'm sorry, Rosita? As in
joey As in Rosita does not move.
rachel Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
joey The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
rachel Stevie the TV?
joey Is there a problem?
rachel No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
ross Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
chandler Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
ross Sure, do whatever you want.
monica Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section
ross Yeah?
monica Look at this.
ross Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
phoebe What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
monica I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
ross I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
phoebe I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
ross Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
chandler Sorry!
rachel Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
joey I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
rachel Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
joey She's not even cold yet!
rachel But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
joey That's true.
rachel Okay? You ready?
joey Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
ross I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
monica Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
ross They kept your room for a while.
monica Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
ross Come on, you know they love you.
monica As much as they love you?
ross I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
phoebe Hey.
ross Hey.
monica Hey!
phoebe Ugh, I hate this year!
ross What's wrong with this year?
phoebe Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
monica That was me and Ross.
phoebe Oh that's right!
ross Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
monica Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
phoebe Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
ross What?
phoebe Oh yeah, like you never called!
supervisor So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
phoebe Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
supervisor Why don't we do a trial run.
phoebe Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
supervisor I'm the supply manager.
phoebe Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
supervisor We don't need any toner.
phoebe Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
supervisor Okay, what was wrong with that call?
phoebe Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
supervisor They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
phoebe Oh.
supervisor So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
phoebe No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
chandler Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
ross Dad?
mr_geller I'm here!
ross Hey!
mr_geller Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
ross Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
mr_geller Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
ross Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
mr_geller I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
monica Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories
mr_geller Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
monica I used to love to play restaurant.
ross Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
monica Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
mr_geller So, I think you're boxes are over here.
ross Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
mr_geller I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
ross Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
mr_geller Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
ross It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
mr_geller Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
ross What?
mr_geller Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
ross How are you ever going to sell this place?
mr_geller I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
ross Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
mr_geller You don't secretly smoke do you?
ross No!
mr_geller So it's just your mother then.
phoebe Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
earl I don't need any toner.
phoebe I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
earl Not me.
phoebe May I ask why?
earl You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
phoebe I surely do!
earl Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
phoebe Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
earl Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
phoebe No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
earl Well...I only have one thing to do today. I guess I could push it back.
phoebe Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
earl It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
phoebe Chandler?
earl I-I'm sorry?
phoebe No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
earl Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
chandler My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
rachel You will like it!
joey No I won't.
rachel You don't even know!
joey Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
rachel Well look, if you don't like this
joey I don't know why you say that so soon.
rachel Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
joey Francette? What is she? A couch?
joey Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
rachel Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
joey Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
rachel That's weird.
joey No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
rachel It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
joey Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
rachel Joey, I really don't
joey Can you tell me how this happened?
rachel Well no.
joey Miracle!
rachel No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
joey Someone like an...angel?
rachel That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
joey Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
mr_geller Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
ross Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
mr_geller Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
ross Well, can you blame her?
mr_geller Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could
ross Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
mr_geller Really?
ross Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
mr_geller Great!
ross Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
mr_geller Sure!
ross Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
mr_geller This could've been hers!
ross Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
mr_geller Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
rachel I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
joey Yeah, me too.
rachel Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
joey Fine.
rachel Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
joey No. Really?
rachel Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
joey My chair heels itself.
phoebe Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
guy Hey guy!
phoebe Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
earl No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
phoebe All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
earl Yeah! Right!
phoebe Oh sorry, boyfriend!
earl Oh no.
phoebe No, whatever! Anything!
the_hey_guy_guy Hey guy!
phoebe Yeah, he's gotta go.
earl Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
phoebe No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
supervisor The new girl's good.
monica Hey guys! Hey!
ross Hey.
monica Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
mr_geller That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
ross Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
monica Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
ross Well, these. These are yours right here.
monica Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
ross Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
monica Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
ross Nu-uh!
monica Oh, an old glove?
mr_geller Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
monica Wow! Look at this! I can't believe I even fit into this shirt! Oh, this is yours.
ross Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
monica This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
ross Umm, your boxes are umm
monica What?
ross Dad?
mr_geller Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
monica Just mine?
mr_geller I'm afraid so.
monica So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
mr_geller Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
monica So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
mr_geller There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
monica I can't believe this!
mr_geller Screw it! I'm having one.
rachel Hey Chandler!
chandler Hey!
rachel How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
chandler Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
rachel Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
chandler Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
rachel I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
chandler That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
rachel Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair
chandler Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
rachel Yeah.
chandler I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
rachel Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
chandler Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
rachel Noo! Angels.
chandler I'm gettin' my chair back!
rachel What? Wh-hey!
joey Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
chandler Joey you broke my chair!!
joey Your chair?!
rachel Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
joey So, there was no miracle?!
rachel No Joe, no miracle.
joey Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
rachel Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
chandler I think I should get the chair!
joey How do you figure?
chandler Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
rachel No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
chandler Well, where's the logic in that?!
rachel The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
chandler So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
joey That's right!
chandler What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
joey Yeah! We are!
rachel We're the Cobras!
phoebe Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
marge Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
earl I'm right here!!!!
phoebe Earl! I'm Phoebe.
earl Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
phoebe Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
earl Look, um I really appreciate your coming down
phoebe No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
earl Why?!
phoebe Because it was fate that made me call you today!
earl I thought it was toner.
phoebe No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
earl Really?!
phoebe Yes.
earl How?
phoebe I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
earl Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
phoebe No, it's fate!
earl It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
phoebe Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
earl I'm actually the office manager.
phoebe Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
earl Well, was there anything else?!
phoebe Sure! Umm, where are you from?
earl Philadelphia.
phoebe Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
earl Really?
phoebe Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
earl Yeah-yeah.
phoebe But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
earl Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
phoebe Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
earl Yeah.
monica Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
ross All right. I think it was a mouse.
mr_geller How are you honey?
monica How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
mr_geller Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
monica What's this?
mr_geller It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
monica What?!
ross What?!!!
mr_geller I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
monica Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
ross Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
mr_geller Why don't we take it for a spin?
monica All right!
ross Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
joey Oh yeah.
rachel Ahhhh....
joey Ahhh...... Eh?
rachel Uh-huh.
monica Hey guys!
rachel Hey!
joey Hey!
monica Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
rachel Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
monica Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
