phoebe_buffay Hi guys!
all@ Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
phoebe_buffay Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
all@ Ohh. Ouch.
rachel_green What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
monica_geller Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
rachel_green Since when?
joey_tribbiani Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
chandler_bing Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
phoebe_buffay Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
rachel_green And everybody knows this?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Cushions the blow.
chandler_bing Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
dr_ross_geller That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
monica_geller Uh, Ross.
dr_ross_geller What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
chandler_bing "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
joey_tribbiani "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
chandler_bing Hey, that was really good!
joey_tribbiani Thanks! Let's keep going.
chandler_bing Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
joey_tribbiani "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
chandler_bing "Smoke away."
chandler_bing I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Relax your hand!
chandler_bing Not so much!
joey_tribbiani Whoah!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Alright, now try taking a puff.
chandler_bing Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
joey_tribbiani No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
chandler_bing It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
chandler_bing Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
joey_tribbiani Y'miss it?
chandler_bing Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
monica_geller No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
joey_tribbiani That's ridiculous!
dr_ross_geller Can I use.. either thumb?
rachel_green Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
all@ Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
rachel_green Good for me!
joey_tribbiani Y'okay, Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
monica_geller What did they do to you?
phoebe_buffay It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
dr_ross_geller Easy.
phoebe_buffay - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
chandler_bing Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
phoebe_buffay Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
joey_tribbiani What are you talking about? Keep it!
phoebe_buffay It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
rachel_green Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
monica_geller We're with you. We got it.
phoebe_buffay Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
rachel_green Chandler, what are you doing?
monica_geller Hey. Whaddya doing?
all@ Oh! Oh, God!
dr_ross_geller What is this?!
chandler_bing I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
chandler_bing And this- is my reward!
dr_ross_geller Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
chandler_bing Okay, so this time I won't quit!
all@ Ohhh! Put it out!
chandler_bing All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
phoebe_buffay Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
monica_geller Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
rachel_green This Alan again? How's it goin'?
monica_geller 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
joey_tribbiani So when do we get to meet the guy?
monica_geller Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
all@ Oh, come on! Come on!
monica_geller No. Not after what happened with Steve.
chandler_bing What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
monica_geller Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
rachel_green Well, then can we meet him?
monica_geller Nope. Schhorry.
monica_geller I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
paula Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you
monica_geller I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
paula Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
joey_tribbiani Let it go, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
monica_geller Do you all promise?
all@ Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
monica_geller Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
joey_tribbiani You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
dr_ross_geller Hey, Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
rachel_green What bank is this?
monica_geller Hey. It's him. Who is it?
alan It's Alan.
joey_tribbiani Chandler! He's here!
monica_geller Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
monica_geller Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
alan Hi.
all@ Hi, Alan.
alan I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
monica_geller Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
monica_geller C'mon!
dr_ross_geller ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
all@ Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
monica_geller Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
all@ Yeah!
rachel_green And did you notice...?
the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode03 Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
phoebe_buffay Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
dr_ross_geller ...What shoe?
phoebe_buffay From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
dr_ross_geller ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
rachel_green What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
monica_geller Really!
chandler_bing Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
dr_ross_geller You know what I like most about him, though?
all@ What?
dr_ross_geller The way he makes me feel about myself.
all@ Yeah...
monica_geller Hi.. how was the game?
dr_ross_geller Well..
all@ WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
monica_geller Fantastic! I have one question
joey_tribbiani Alan.
dr_ross_geller He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
rachel_green I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
chandler_bing Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
monica_geller Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
dr_ross_geller What?
monica_geller ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
rachel_green Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
chandler_bing I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
phoebe_buffay Hey, Lizzie.
lizzy Hey, Weird Girl.
phoebe_buffay I brought you alphabet soup.
lizzy Did you pick out the vowels?
phoebe_buffay Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
lizzy Saltines?
phoebe_buffay No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
lizzy What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
phoebe_buffay I know.
lizzy Weird Girl, what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
lizzy No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
phoebe_buffay Oh, that's fine, no.
lizzy Would you like my tin-foil hat?
phoebe_buffay No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
lizzy Please, let me do something.
phoebe_buffay Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
lizzy Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
lizzy Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
phoebe_buffay No, I'm fine.
lizzy See ya.
phoebe_buffay Huh!
dr_ross_geller A thumb?!
all@ Eww!
phoebe_buffay I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
chandler_bing Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
phoebe_buffay Does, um, anyone wanna see?
all@ Nooo!
all@ Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
rachel_green It's worse than the thumb!
chandler_bing Hey, this is so unfair!
monica_geller Oh, why is it unfair?
chandler_bing So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
joey_tribbiani ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
rachel_green Well, I-I could live without it.
joey_tribbiani Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
dr_ross_geller Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
joey_tribbiani Oh, "you do, do you"?
dr_ross_geller You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
rachel_green "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
rachel_green Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
monica_geller Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
paula No.
monica_geller Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
paula Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
monica_geller Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
paula Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
monica_geller I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
paula Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
monica_geller No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
joey_tribbiani Do you have any respect for your body?
dr_ross_geller Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
chandler_bing Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
rachel_green Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
chandler_bing Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
rachel_green God, he's good.
dr_ross_geller If only he were a woman.
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
dr_ross_geller Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
monica_geller Hey. Where's Joey?
chandler_bing Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
rachel_green I think he's across the hall.
monica_geller Thanks.
dr_ross_geller There y'go.
chandler_bing Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I might!
phoebe_buffay Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
all@ You're kidding. Oh my God.
phoebe_buffay And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
joey_tribbiani What's going on?
monica_geller Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
joey_tribbiani Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
rachel_green Uh, Joey..
joey_tribbiani Oh, God!
monica_geller Okay..
all@ Oh! That was Lambchop!
monica_geller Please, guys, we have to talk.
phoebe_buffay Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
monica_geller Alright, we have to talk.
phoebe_buffay There it is!
monica_geller Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
dr_ross_geller Is there somebody else?
monica_geller No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
rachel_green We didn't change..
joey_tribbiani So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
phoebe_buffay You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
monica_geller Look, I- I could go on pretending-
joey_tribbiani Okay!
monica_geller -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
dr_ross_geller Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
monica_geller I'm sorry..
chandler_bing Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
rachel_green I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
monica_geller I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
all@ Oh, yeah! Right!
monica_geller Are you guys gonna be okay?
dr_ross_geller Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
monica_geller I understand.
alan Wow.
monica_geller I'm, I'm really sorry.
alan Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
monica_geller Relieved?
alan Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
rachel_green Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. He could row like a viking.
monica_geller Hi.
all@ Mmm.
dr_ross_geller So how'd it go?
monica_geller Oh, y'know..
phoebe_buffay Did he mention us?
monica_geller He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
dr_ross_geller You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
chandler_bing ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
all@ No no no!
chandler_bing I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
phoebe_buffay If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
chandler_bing Yeah, alright.
