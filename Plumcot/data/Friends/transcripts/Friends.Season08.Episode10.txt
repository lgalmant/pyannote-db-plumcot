monica_geller Hey! So what do you think?
chandler_bing New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
monica_geller Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller I know.
chandler_bing I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
monica_geller I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
chandler_bing She had a point.
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
monica_geller They're mine!
chandler_bing Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
rachel_green Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
monica_geller Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
chandler_bing I have you.
monica_geller Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
dr_ross_geller That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
phoebe_buffay How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
rachel_green He's talking to the baby.
phoebe_buffay Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
rachel_green Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
dr_ross_geller Bye.
rachel_green Bye.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!
rachel_green Hi.
joey_tribbiani Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren
rachel_green No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
rachel_green I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
rachel_green Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
joey_tribbiani Okay, so will you meet with her?
rachel_green Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
joey_tribbiani Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani She took 'em!
phoebe_buffay Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Why?
phoebe_buffay Sting has a son that goes there too!
dr_ross_geller Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
phoebe_buffay You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
dr_ross_geller Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
phoebe_buffay Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
dr_ross_geller What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
phoebe_buffay No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
dr_ross_geller Uh, I actually haven't even met him.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
dr_ross_geller Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
phoebe_buffay There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
monica_geller Hey guys!
chandler_bing Hey-hey.
rachel_green Hi Monica!
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hi boots.
monica_geller See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants
chandler_bing You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
phoebe_buffay Wow! They're beautiful!
rachel_green Ahh
monica_geller They hurt so much!
phoebe_buffay What?!
monica_geller The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
rachel_green Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
monica_geller I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
phoebe_buffay Well then get your money back and return them!
monica_geller I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
chandler_bing I don't think you did a very thorough job!
dr_ross_geller I dropped him off at Carol's. Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
phoebe_buffay Oh no! Why not?
dr_ross_geller Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
phoebe_buffay How come?!
dr_ross_geller Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
phoebe_buffay Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.
phoebe_buffay Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
dr_ross_geller Playpen?! Ben's seven!
phoebe_buffay Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
dr_ross_geller Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
phoebe_buffay Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Rosssss can!
dr_ross_geller Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just
phoebe_buffay Rossss can!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, I
phoebe_buffay Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
joey_tribbiani Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
rachel_green Oh Joey, I'm hardly a
joey_tribbiani My little sister Dina!
rachel_green Right! Hi Dina!
dina_tribbiani Hi.
rachel_green Nice to meet you.
dina_tribbiani Thanks so much for meetin' with me. Joey's told me so much about you!
joey_tribbiani This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business.
rachel_green Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel
dina_tribbiani I...I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
rachel_green And there's marketing
monica_geller Ahhhhhhhh!
chandler_bing What's wrong?
monica_geller Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
chandler_bing Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
monica_geller Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
chandler_bing Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining.
monica_geller I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
chandler_bing Why not?
monica_geller Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
chandler_bing Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
monica_geller Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.
chandler_bing You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
monica_geller Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
dina_tribbiani I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!
rachel_green Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for.
dina_tribbiani Thank you.
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
rachel_green Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
joey_tribbiani Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
dina_tribbiani Joe, mom and dad are fine
joey_tribbiani Is that a sandwich?!
rachel_green Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
dina_tribbiani I'm pregnant.
joey_tribbiani What?!
rachel_green Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
joey_tribbiani Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
dina_tribbiani Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
rachel_green What?! Dina
joey_tribbiani Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
dina_tribbiani Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.
joey_tribbiani You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
dina_tribbiani Why? Where are you going?
joey_tribbiani I can't look at you right now!
dina_tribbiani Wow.
rachel_green I know.
phoebe_buffay Oh, there you are Ben!
ben_geller Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
phoebe_buffay Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
ben_geller Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
phoebe_buffay Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
ben_geller I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
phoebe_buffay Him you're friends with.
the_teacher Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
phoebe_buffay Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
the_teacher Are you with one of the students?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
the_teacher Are you one of Ben's mothers?
phoebe_buffay I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
the_teacher Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
the_teacher I've only met your partner Carol.
phoebe_buffay Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
the_teacher Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben? Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
the_teacher Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
chandler_bing Y'know, that party wasn't bad.
monica_geller Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
chandler_bing I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
monica_geller Oh no, we can't walk!
chandler_bing What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
monica_geller Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
chandler_bing What's going on?
monica_geller I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
chandler_bing So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
monica_geller How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
chandler_bing Hop on.
monica_geller Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh
chandler_bing Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
dina_tribbiani Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
rachel_green What college was that Dina?
dina_tribbiani Oh my God! Bobby!
bobby Hi Dina. Good to see you.
rachel_green Joey, what are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman
rachel_green Oh Joey this is crazy!
joey_tribbiani Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man
dina_tribbiani No!
joey_tribbiani Oh you'll take 'em!
dina_tribbiani No I won't!
joey_tribbiani Hey! You don't get a say in this!
dina_tribbiani Yes I do!
joey_tribbiani Ahhh! I heard "I do", we're halfway there! Okay! You!
rachel_green All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
bobby Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
joey_tribbiani Well what am I supposed to do?
rachel_green You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
joey_tribbiani No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
rachel_green Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
bobby Yeah...we kinda didn't use any
rachel_green Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
phoebe_buffay Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
trudie_styler Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
trudie_styler I'm Trudie.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
trudie_styler You must be Ben's mum.
phoebe_buffay Why else would I be here?
trudie_styler Do sit down.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
trudie_styler I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
trudie_styler I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.
phoebe_buffay Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
trudie_styler Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
trudie_styler Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
phoebe_buffay Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
trudie_styler So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
phoebe_buffay Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
trudie_styler Are you here for tickets?
phoebe_buffay Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
trudie_styler I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
phoebe_buffay Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
trudie_styler Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
phoebe_buffay The Police? Here? A reunion?!
chandler_bing Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
monica_geller Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
chandler_bing Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
monica_geller My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
chandler_bing I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
monica_geller Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
chandler_bing I don't have your boots.
monica_geller Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
chandler_bing Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
monica_geller Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
chandler_bing Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
monica_geller Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
chandler_bing Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
monica_geller Okay. All right.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!
rachel_green Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
joey_tribbiani Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
bobby Well...I really have high hopes for my band.
joey_tribbiani You were right. He is funny.
rachel_green Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
bobby Well it's just me and my pal Rooster, the band's name is Numb Nuts.
rachel_green Really?
joey_tribbiani Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!
dina_tribbiani No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!
joey_tribbiani So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
rachel_green Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
joey_tribbiani No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
dina_tribbiani Excuse me?
joey_tribbiani One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
rachel_green So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
joey_tribbiani Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!
dina_tribbiani Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help. And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
bobby You bet I am! And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.
dina_tribbiani Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?
joey_tribbiani Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
dina_tribbiani And you're my big brother! I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world. I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
joey_tribbiani Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
dina_tribbiani Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
joey_tribbiani Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
dina_tribbiani We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
joey_tribbiani That's right! By his uncle too!
bobby And by you.
rachel_green Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
joey_tribbiani Come here!
rachel_green No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
dr_ross_geller You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
dr_ross_geller Well...let's just say... Rosss caaaaan!
phoebe_buffay Oo, where are the seats?
dr_ross_geller Uh, middle balcony.
phoebe_buffay Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
