monica Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey how was dinner?!
phoebe Dinner was good!
monica Okay!
phoebe I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
monica Okay!
phoebe Oh, well hello there.
guy Hi.
phoebe I didn't see this on the menu.
monica Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
phoebe Oh, so you're Monica's boss?
tim Actually she's my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
phoebe Oh! I sous stand.
monica Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
tim Yeah.
phoebe Oh you...you made pesto?
tim Yes I did.
phoebe Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
tim I...I-I don't know, but I would say it's pretty good-o.
monica All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
tim I like your necklace.
phoebe I made it myself.
tim You are so talented.
phoebe Well, it's no pesto.
monica All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
mr_franklin Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
chandler You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
mr_franklin You're a joker Bing.
chandler What's funny about that?
ross Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
chandler Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
ross Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
chandler The Hard Rock Cafá?
ross Yeah!
chandler Again?!
ross Yeah!!
ross I'm telling you, I like the food!
chandler You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
bob Hey Toby! Have a good night.
ross Did that guy just call you Toby?
chandler Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
ross Well, why don't you correct him?
chandler Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
ross Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
chandler No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
ross Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
chandler Shh! It is a family name!
ross Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
joeys_costar Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
dr_drake_ramoray What is it?
joeys_costar Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.
dr_drake_ramoray Is it serious?
joeys_costar Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
dr_drake_ramoray Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
joeys_costar We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body, it was gone.
director Cut! Very nice people!
joey Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
rachel Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
joey I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
rachel You don't know do you?
joey No, couldn't care less.
joeys_costar Hey good scene man.
joey Hey you too!
joeys_costar Alright.
joey What? You weren't in it.
rachel Oh!
joey Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
kash Yes?
joey This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
rachel Hi.
kash Hey! How come I haven't seen you here before?
rachel Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
joey Here we go! Here we go!
rachel Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
kash Bye.
rachel Say hi to Wally.
phoebe Ooh Monica!
monica Hi!
phoebe Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
monica I...I have to fire him.
phoebe But why?!
monica Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
phoebe Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
monica Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
phoebe But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
monica All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
phoebe That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
monica I paid to have this done.
phoebe Love it!
joey Hey!
rachel Hi!
joey Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
rachel I thought I was a complete idiot.
joey Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
rachel Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
joey I said no.
rachel What?!
joey What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
rachel Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
joey I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
rachel Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
joey Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great
rachel Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!
chandler Hey Bob.
bob Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
chandler If I see him, I'll ask.
bob Toby!
mr_franklin Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
chandler Yeah!
mr_franklin Oh then you know each other.
chandler We're on a semi-first name basis.
mr_franklin What do you think of adding him to our team?
chandler Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
mr_franklin Really? They love him down on six.
chandler But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
mr_franklin Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
chandler I think it's best sir.
mr_franklin But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
chandler Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.
mr_franklin That's a good one.
chandler What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
phoebe But
monica No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
phoebe Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
monica Why not?!
phoebe Because I'm dumping him today.
monica What?! You said he was sweet!
phoebe He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
monica Just don't pick up your phone.
phoebe Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
monica What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
phoebe You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
monica Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
phoebe Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
monica Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
phoebe Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
monica What do you mean?
phoebe Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
monica I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
phoebe All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
bob Hey Toby, you got a sec?
chandler Sure, what's up?
bob I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
rachel Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
ross Hey!
rachel Hi!
joey Hey!
ross So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
joey No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
ross Rach? You wanna come?
rachel Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
ross A date?
rachel Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
ross Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
joey It's no Ukrainian film.
rachel Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!
ross A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
joey I set her up with this actor on my show.
ross You set her up?!
joey No
ross Joey what-what were you thinking?!
joey Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
ross Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?
joey Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
ross A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
joey Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
ross Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
kash Hey Joey.
joey Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
kash Hey.
ross Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
kash Yeah.
ross A bit of a daredevil are we?
rachel Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
kash Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
rachel Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
ross Okay. Have a great time you guys.
rachel Thank you.
kash Thank you.
ross Yes it is too slutty!
tim Hi!
phoebe Hi.
tim Oh, I'm so glad you called. I feel like it's always me calling you. So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
phoebe It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
tim It's because I'm with you.
phoebe Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I
tim Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
phoebe Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
tim Awww, I'll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here.
joey So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
ross Books?
joey All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
ross Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
joey And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
ross Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
joey Dude! What is going on?!
ross I just...I have to find out how it went.
joey Why?
ross This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
joey They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
ross I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
joey Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
ross I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
joey What do you mean?
ross It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
joey That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
ross No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
joey Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
ross It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
joey Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
ross No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
joey I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
ross No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
joey That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
ross Yeah.
joey Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
ross We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
joey No, I said fun!
bob Hey Toby!
chandler Hey Bobby.
bob It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
chandler Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
bob I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
chandler Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
bob Toby don't.
chandler Bob!
bob Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
chandler Well that puts me in a difficult position.
monica Hey.
tim I got your page, is everything okay?
monica Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
tim Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
monica Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
phoebe Monica!

tim What?
phoebe I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
monica You're fired.
tim Why?
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm...I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.
monica Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.
phoebe Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
tim Wow! Umm, okay. Umm... I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it's only because I think you're so amazing. And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I-you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for. Anyway
monica Tim wait!
tim Yeah?
monica Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
tim Really?
monica Yeah.
tim Thank you so much! 'Cause I-I know I can do better!
monica Okay.
phoebe And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
ross Hello.
rachel Hi!
ross Well, how was the date?
rachel Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
ross Uh-huh. What happened?
rachel I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
ross Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
rachel Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
ross Oh?
rachel He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
ross He sounds swell.
rachel Doesn't he?
ross Hey, wanna...wanna a little cheering up?
rachel Yes.
ross Sit down.
rachel Okay.
ross Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
rachel Chandler M. Bing?
ross Yeah-ha!
rachel Oh my God.
ross I'm sorry about your date.
rachel Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
ross Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
rachel Thanks sweetie.
ross You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
rachel Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
ross Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
rachel Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
ross Right. Good night.
rachel Good night.
mona Ross?
ross Yeah?
mona Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
ross Oh hi!
mona Hi!
ross Wow! Uh...how are you?
mona I'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
ross Oh that's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
mona Oh you're serious. Sure!
ross Great! Well umm
mona I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
ross Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
mona Okay.
chandler Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
bob I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
