joey Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
rachel Oh my...God! Let me see that!
joey You fall for it every time!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hi!
phoebe I brought you my old maternity clothes!
rachel Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
phoebe Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
monica Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
rachel No.
monica He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
rachel Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
monica No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
rachel Oh that's nice.
monica Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
joey I just want you to say it once in a while.
monica All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
joey What?!
monica Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey
joey Phoebe!
phoebe Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
joey No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
monica All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
joey She is?
rachel Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
joey Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
monica Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
joey But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
monica All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.
joey No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
monica All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
joey That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
monica Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Happy Thanksgiving!
monica You too!
phoebe Anything I can do to help?
monica Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
phoebe Sure!
monica I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
phoebe Okay.
monica No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
phoebe Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?
chandler I have no idea.
phoebe What?
chandler Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
phoebe I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
chandler Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
monica Is your team winning hon?
chandler Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
phoebe Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
monica Oh, I didn't know you liked football.
phoebe Well normally I don't, but y'know......Green Bay is playing.
monica You like Green Bay?
phoebe Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
monica Hey!
will Hey!
will Happy Thanksgiving!
monica Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like
will 150 pounds. Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
monica A pie!
will Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy...it's no good. Throw it out.
monica You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
will Hey.
chandler Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
monica This is Phoebe.
phoebe Hey. Wow! Well done.
monica Wanna give me a hand?
will Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!
monica Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
chandler I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
monica Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
will Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
monica Good. And Rachel Green too.
will Oh.
monica Is there a problem?
will Nope. Uh, it's okay. It's just uh, God I hated her.
monica What?
will Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? No Will no!
chandler Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
phoebe Oh okay.
chandler Oh come on!
phoebe Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
monica Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
joey Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
monica All right.
joey Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
will I actually know what you're talking about. I'm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
joey Who the hell is this guy?
monica Will! From high school.
joey Oh hey!
monica Joey.
will Hello.
ross Will!
will Ross!
ross Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff?
will It's good to see you man.
ross Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
will I'm a commodities broker.
ross Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
will Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
ross Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
will That was such a fun night!
ross Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
will Yeah.
ross Yeah.
will God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
ross Yeah.
will So what do you, what do you do now?
ross So how long are you in town?
rachel Hi!
monica Hey sweetie. Oh good.
will Rachel Green.
ross Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
will Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
ross Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
will Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
rachel Oh my God Monica, who is that?
monica That's Will from high school!
rachel Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
monica Okay, dinner's ready!
chandler Good game!
phoebe Yeah.
chandler Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
monica Oh, so who won?
phoebe Green Bay.
chandler Detroit.
monica What?
phoebe Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...Mermen.
rachel Hi! Will, right?
will Right.
rachel Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
will Oh I-I remember you.
rachel Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
will You are unbelievable.
rachel Thank you!
monica Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? And Will you sit way over there.
joey That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
monica This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
joey Oh. How-how big is that?
monica About nineteen pounds.
joey It's like me when I was born.
rachel All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
will Oh, you'd like that wouldn't ya?
rachel What? Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
will Typical.
rachel I'm sorry. What?
will I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.
joey Seriously, who is this guy?
rachel Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
will I don't know? Do I? Do I?
phoebe I think you do.
monica Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
will A little mean? You made my life miserable!
rachel I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I
will Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
monica Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard
will Yams!!!!
monica Okay.
rachel Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school
will Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!
rachel You had a club?!
will That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
rachel Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
will Me and Ross.
ross No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
rachel So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
will Yes he was.
ross No. No.
rachel So who else was in this club?
ross Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.
rachel So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
will You went out with her?! We had a pact!
ross That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.
will Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
rachel Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
monica I swear I didn't. Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
ross_and_will Yeah.
monica Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
ross Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I...I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
will Co-founded!
ross ...co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
will Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
rachel Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
will Well, we did a little more than that.
ross No-no! No-no. No-no.
phoebe What?! What else did you do?
will We started a rumor.
rachel What rumor?
phoebe Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
rachel Ross!
ross It was no big deal. We-we...said that the rumor was...that umm...you had both...male and female reproductive parts.
rachel What?!
will That's right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
rachel Oh my God!
monica You started that?!
rachel What?! You heard that?!
monica Everyone at our school heard it!
chandler Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
rachel Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
ross Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one's not really our fault.
rachel Monica, how come you never told me this?!
monica I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
rachel Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
joey I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
rachel Oh!
joey You are my Everest.
monica Joey, you don't have to finish that.
joey Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just...I just-I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give.
rachel Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
ross Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
rachel "Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
ross Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!
rachel Yes!
will Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
monica Oh! Me too!
ross Well look-look I'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
rachel I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
monica That's not totally true.
rachel What?
ross What?
monica Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
ross How did you know that?!!!!
monica It's true?!!
ross No.
rachel Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
will Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
chandler I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
ross Hey! She didn't look 50!
chandler Did she look 16?
rachel Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
phoebe Oh! Wow!
ross She didn't photograph well!
chandler Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
phoebe So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
ross I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
monica Didn't she walk with a cane?
ross Only when it was damp!! I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? I'm back in the club!
will Yeah!
phoebe I wanna join!
rachel Wh-Phoebe!!
phoebe I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
rachel All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!
monica All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
rachel Wow
monica And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
ross As a romancer of the elderly.
monica Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
ross The eyes...did still sparkle.
monica Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
rachel She's right.
ross Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
will Hold on! You got her pregnant?
ross Yeah.
will Are ya getting married?
ross Nope.
will So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude! Anybody?
phoebe Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
joey All right where's that turkey!
phoebe Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
joey Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
joey Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
monica Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
chandler Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
phoebe Is there anything we can do for you?
joey No just, nobody press on my stomach.
rachel You can keep those pants by the way.
joey Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
monica Yeah, you want some?
joey Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
