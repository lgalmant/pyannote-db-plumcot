dr_ross_geller Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
joey_tribbiani Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
chandler_bing Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
joey_tribbiani Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
chandler_bing I see where you're goin'!
dr_ross_geller What's up with the greed Joe?
joey_tribbiani All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
dr_ross_geller Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
phoebe_buffay Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
dr_ross_geller Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
joey_tribbiani Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
chandler_bing Ah, finally an explanation.
joey_tribbiani No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
gunther Joey!
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
gunther What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
joey_tribbiani Uhh do it?
gunther That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
joey_tribbiani Well, where was I?
dr_ross_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what have you guys been up to?
phoebe_buffay Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
dr_ross_geller Wow!
rachel_green Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
joey_tribbiani Takes it out of you?
phoebe_buffay Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller After one class? I don't think so.
rachel_green What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
dr_ross_geller Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
rachel_green Isn't that a kind of sushi?
dr_ross_geller No, it's a concept!
phoebe_buffay Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
dr_ross_geller All right, maybe it means that too
rachel_green Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
phoebe_buffay Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
dr_ross_geller Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
phoebe_buffay You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
dr_ross_geller All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
dr_ross_geller All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
rachel_green Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what
chandler_bing Hey-hey, is Monica here?
phoebe_buffay No.
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
rachel_green Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
chandler_bing She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
joey_tribbiani And of course, crotchless panties.
chandler_bing Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
rachel_green Aw, I love that.
phoebe_buffay You guys!
joey_tribbiani You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut
rachel_green Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
chandler_bing Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
chandler_bing I made a
phoebe_buffay What is that?
chandler_bing Nothing!
dr_ross_geller So what are you gonna do?
chandler_bing Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
phoebe_buffay Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
rachel_green Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
phoebe_buffay Now, it's you little bunny friend.
chandler_bing This, this actually is a
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
monica_geller Oh, yeah.
chandler_bing Do we have to make the entire thing?
monica_geller Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
chandler_bing Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
monica_geller Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
joey_tribbiani Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
the_receptionist We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
joey_tribbiani Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
the_receptionist Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
joey_tribbiani Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
the_receptionist Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
joey_tribbiani But it's $2,000.
the_receptionist Sorry.
joey_tribbiani Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
the_receptionist We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
dr_ross_geller DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
phoebe_buffay Ross!!!
rachel_green What the hell was that?!
dr_ross_geller A lesson in the importance of unagi.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, you're a freak!!
dr_ross_geller Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
rachel_green All right, so we weren't prepared!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
joey_tribbiani 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller Chandler. I sensed it was you.
chandler_bing What?!
dr_ross_geller Unagi. I'm always aware.
chandler_bing Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
dr_ross_geller What's up?
chandler_bing I can't figure out what to make Monica.
dr_ross_geller Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
chandler_bing I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
chandler_bing Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
dr_ross_geller Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
chandler_bing Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
dr_ross_geller Why not?
chandler_bing Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green DANGER!!!!!
rachel_green Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
