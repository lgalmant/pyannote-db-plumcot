chandler_bing Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
monica_geller Hey.
all@ Hey!
rachel_green How'd it go with Pete?!
joey_tribbiani Tell us!
monica_geller You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
tim I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Yeah, could you scooch?
bonnie Yeah, move over just a little bit.
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Keep on scooching.
monica_geller So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
bonnie What's the matter?
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
bonnie How do you know?
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Well y'know, he's got access.
bonnie Yeah.
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
bonnie Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 That's the one.
phoebe_buffay All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
dr_ross_geller What happened?
monica_geller I...
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
monica_geller Forget it.
bonnie So it's-it's not heeled yet?
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
bonnie Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 What is it, Tim?
bonnie It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
joey_tribbiani So you're the gynaecologist?
bonnie Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
robin_williams#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
bonnie Thomas, come back here!
phoebe_buffay So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
monica_geller I have no idea.
rachel_green So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
phoebe_buffay No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
monica_geller He didn't ask me to marry him.
all@ Ohh.
phoebe_buffay Well then definately don't take his name.
monica_geller He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode24 Pete?!
rachel_green Why?! What is it?
monica_geller I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
phoebe_buffay Oh?!
monica_geller Yeah, but without the costumes.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
joey_tribbiani And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
chandler_bing Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: "They're are no rules."
monica_geller So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
monica_geller What's fish hooking?
dr_ross_geller Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
joey_tribbiani What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
doug So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
chandler_bing Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
doug You! Chuckles! What's your name?
chandler_bing Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
doug No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
dr_ross_geller That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
rachel_green Yes!!
chandler_bing All right buddy, way to go!
dr_ross_geller Dude, what are you doing?
chandler_bing Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
phoebe_buffay Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
chandler_bing Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
monica_geller I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
rachel_green Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
chandler_bing Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
monica_geller Okay, can we please go eat?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. What are we getting?
monica_geller Anything but stew.
dr_ross_geller All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
chandler_bing What if Joey were president?
phoebe_buffay Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
rachel_green Oh, ah with who?
phoebe_buffay Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
rachel_green Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
phoebe_buffay You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
rachel_green Oh! That's fine.
phoebe_buffay Great! Okay, good for you!
hoshi You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
pete_becker I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
hoshi It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
monica_geller Hi!
pete_becker Monica! Hi honey.
hoshi All right, on the table.
monica_geller Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
pete_becker Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
monica_geller Promise me you'll be careful.
pete_becker I promise.
monica_geller Hey, are we still on for tonight?
pete_becker Yeah.
monica_geller Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
hoshi No! No boom-boom before big fight!
monica_geller How 'bout just a boom?
rachel_green Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
phoebe_buffay Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
bonnie Hi!
rachel_green This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
bonnie I can show you an ID if you want?
rachel_green Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
bonnie Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
rachel_green Oh, that must be it.
phoebe_buffay Well I hope you have fun tonight.
bonnie Thanks! You too.
rachel_green You said she was bald.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
rachel_green How could you not tell me that she has hair?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
rachel_green Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
phoebe_buffay Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
rachel_green Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
rachel_green Why, does she have a bad personality?
phoebe_buffay Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
doug Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
chandler_bing What is with him?
phil With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
stevens We never get smacked.
chandler_bing Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
phil Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
stevens I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
doug Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
chandler_bing No sir.
doug There you go.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller God Ross, what is that?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
announcer From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
monica_geller I love you, Pete!!!
announcer And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
monica_geller Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
pete_becker Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
dr_ross_geller Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
dr_ross_geller All right! You go get him! Let's go!
referee Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
pete_becker Uh-oh.
monica_geller Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
pete_becker It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
monica_geller I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
pete_becker What, look back?
monica_geller Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
pete_becker Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
monica_geller Well, no. But...
pete_becker Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
monica_geller That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
pete_becker Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
monica_geller You didn't know that already?
pete_becker Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
monica_geller Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
pete_becker Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
monica_geller Yeah. That-that was the problem.
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
monica_geller Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
dr_ross_geller Hot dog?
monica_geller Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
phoebe_buffay So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
dr_ross_geller What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, that's too bad!
dr_ross_geller No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
chandler_bing Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
dr_ross_geller Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
joey_tribbiani Hey, the fight's starting!
dr_ross_geller Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
chandler_bing Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
joey_tribbiani Fight's over!
chandler_bing Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
doug Bing! You got those numbers for me?
chandler_bing No, I ah, I didn't do them.
doug Oh, you forgot?
chandler_bing No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
doug Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
chandler_bing Doug!!
doug Hmm.
chandler_bing I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
doug Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
chandler_bing No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
doug Oh?
chandler_bing Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
doug Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
chandler_bing Okay.
doug Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
chandler_bing Ahhhhh!
phoebe_buffay Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
rachel_green Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
phoebe_buffay No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
rachel_green Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
rachel_green Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
phoebe_buffay Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
rachel_green Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
phoebe_buffay You said it was okay!
rachel_green You said she was bald!!
phoebe_buffay What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
rachel_green Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
phoebe_buffay Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
rachel_green Yes.
phoebe_buffay Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
rachel_green Yes.
phoebe_buffay So?
rachel_green I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
phoebe_buffay Oh no.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Oh, we killed them all.
rachel_green Oh!
pete_becker It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
monica_geller Please tell me you're stopping now.
pete_becker I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
monica_geller You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
pete_becker I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
monica_geller Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
pete_becker Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
monica_geller Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
pete_becker Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
monica_geller Then I've gotta go. Bye.
pete_becker Mon-Monica?
monica_geller Yes?
pete_becker Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
doug So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
chandler_bing Thank you, sir.
stevens Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
doug Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
chandler_bing No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
doug Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
chandler_bing Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
doug Now get on out of here, you!
announcer Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
chandler_bing Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
rachel_green Oh, I can't watch this.
joey_tribbiani Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
monica_geller Really?!
joey_tribbiani No-o-o!!
announcer Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
all@ Oh! Oh!
phoebe_buffay Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
dr_ross_geller Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
all@ Ohh!!
