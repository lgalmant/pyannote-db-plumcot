monica Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
joey Oh, yeah, good idea.

phoebe Hey!
gary Hello!
monica Hey!
gary How are you?
phoebe Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.

chandler Well, I like danger.
gary Okay, you guys free tonight?
joey_and_ross Yeah!!
chandler Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
rachel Hey!
monica Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
rachel Ohh, thank God! Finally!
monica Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
rachel Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
monica You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
rachel Great! Thanks!
monica All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
rachel Okay.
rachel Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
monica I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
rachel Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
ross Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
rachel No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
monica All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
rachel Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
monica Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around
rachel What?!
monica What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
ross That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
chandler It is starting to get dark out there.
ross He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
gary Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
chandler Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
ross Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
gary It's called the cherry.
ross It's the - Chandler!!
joey Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
gary Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
joey Oh-ho, yeah!
gary Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
joey Yep!
gary Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
joey Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
chandler Your tax dollars?
joey Yeah, okay.
chandler Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
joey Did I say you could smell it?!
chandler I can't smell your sandwich?
joey Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
chandler Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
joey Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
chandler Okay.
joey Are you thinking about Monica?
chandler Yeah.
joey Yeah, what's that like?
rachel Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
monica Rach! It's me! Pick up!
rachel Hey! What's up?!
monica I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
rachel So all we have is ice?
monica See if he has ice.
rachel Okay.
emily Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
rachel Oh. Oh!
ross So where are we going next?
gary This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
chandler Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
joey Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
gary It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
ross Yeah, no one talks like that!
joey Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
ross Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
chandler How do you figure that?
ross Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
chandler Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
ross Umm, jealous!
gary Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
ross Yeah, no problem.
gary Ross!
ross Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
chandler Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
joey Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
emily Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
monica Nooo!
rachel I know!
monica Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
rachel What?! We can't do that!
monica We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
rachel Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
monica I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him - help him?
rachel I don't think he's the one who needs help.
monica No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
rachel Ugh!
monica Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
rachel Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
answering_machine Your messages have been erased.
rachel Noooooooo!
chandler Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
gary No. But that reminds me, sign this.
ross What is it?
gary Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
chandler Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
gary Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
ross What? What? What? What is it?
joey Is everything okay?
chandler What's going on?
gary Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
gary Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
joey You okay man?
ross Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
chandler Uh, HELLO!!
joey Hi.
monica All right, I guess we should go.
rachel No, wait. Wait.
monica Oh yeah right!
rachel No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
monica There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
rachel Yeah well unless we tell him.
monica Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
rachel Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
ross Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
monica Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
rachel Right?
gary Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
phoebe John Glenn is here?!
gary No, Joey!
ross Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car
gary Wait! Hold on! Hi!
phoebe Hi!
gary Okay, go ahead.
ross Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
phoebe My God, Joey!
chandler It was a car backfire!
ross Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
joey Yeah, I didn't know that.
ross And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
gary Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
chandler Who jumps at loud noises!
ross Wow! I could've died tonight.
chandler Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
ross I do have a newfound respect for life.
chandler Oh my God!
gary So you wanna get some dinner?
phoebe Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
gary Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
phoebe Okay!
gary All right.
phoebe Bye!
ross_and_joey Bye!
joey Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
joey Dude! How come you took off?
chandler Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever
joey Is something wrong?
chandler No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
joey Okay.
chandler You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
joey That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
chandler I do not hate Ross!
joey Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
chandler What picture?
joey I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
chandler Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
joey Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I... knew... you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
chandler When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
joey Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
chandler From a bullet!
joey I know it doesn't make much sense
chandler Much sense?!
joey Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
chandler So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
joey I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
chandler So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
joey No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
chandler Really?!
joey Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
chandler Thanks.
joey No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
joey How good is that?
chandler Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
joey See?
chandler Hm-hmm.
joey Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
chandler I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
joey Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
rachel Hey! Hi!
ross Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
rachel Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
ross Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
rachel Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
ross The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
rachel What?! What? What happened?!
ross Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
rachel Yeah!
ross And somebody took a shot at me!
rachel Really?!
ross No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I... I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
rachel Because a car backfired?
ross Okay, why are you here?
rachel Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
ross You talked to her?
rachel No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
ross Well, okay, what-what did she say?
rachel Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
ross Wow!
rachel Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
ross Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
rachel Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because - I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me - not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
ross Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
rachel Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
ross Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
rachel Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
ross You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
rachel Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
ross Huh.
rachel I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
ross That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
rachel Well, there you go!
ross Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
rachel Close call day.
ross Hey, thanks Rach.
rachel Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
ross Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
rachel Oh?
ross "Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
rachel No.
ross Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
rachel Yeah.
ross Yeah, I want my money back.
rachel Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
ross Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
phoebe Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
ross I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
monica Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
chandler Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
ross I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
chandler Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
joey Yeah, hero sandwiches.
phoebe Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
