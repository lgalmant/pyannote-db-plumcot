phoebe That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
monica That's also like the tenth time you told us.
phoebe Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
ross Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
phoebe Thank you so much.
rachel So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
phoebe I haven't really had any yet.

chandler Hey.
joey Hey!
ross All right, here's the ring.
chandler Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
ross So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
joey Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
chandler Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
ross I sort've already asked Chandler.
joey What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
ross Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
joey Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
chandler You can be the best man when I get married.
joey I'll never get to be a best man!
ross Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
chandler Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
joey What about me?! You-you just said I could!
chandler I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
joey I can't believe you're not picking me.
ross Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
chandler I'm not even... I'm not even
ross Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
joey Yes! Shame about you man.
phoebe Stop it!

rachel Oh, that is so sweet!
monica I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
rachel Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
monica Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
rachel Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
monica Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
rachel Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
monica Oh, she's gonna love that!
phoebe What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!

chandler You slept with the stripper?
joey Of course!!
phoebe Hi, guys.
rachel Hi! Phoebe.
monica Hi Phoebe.
phoebe I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
rachel No we
monica Hormones.
rachel ...hormones, yeah.
phoebe Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
monica Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
phoebe Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
rachel Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
phoebe Oh!
rachel It just might be too hard, given the history and all that
phoebe Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
rachel Well, h-how is this like that?
phoebe Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know
rachel I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that
phoebe Alrighty, here come the water works.
joey Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
ross Hey guys!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey
ross I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
joey So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
ross Yeah, right!
joey I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
ross That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
chandler So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
ross Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
chandler So you might say, it's a magic ring.
joey Yeah, the stripper stole it.
ross My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
chandler Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
ross All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
joey Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
ross Not on you! On the stripper!
joey Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
ross Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
joey I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
ross So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
joey Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I
chandler Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
joey Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
monica Here's your tea Phoebe.
phoebe It's so good. Oh, thanks.
rachel Good.
monica I'm so glad you liked it.
phoebe Oh!
monica What?!
rachel What?! She made the tea!
phoebe Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
rachel You what?
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
monica Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
rachel Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
phoebe No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
monica Rachel, get the book! The book!
rachel Okay! Okay! Here!
monica The Bible?!
rachel I don't know!
joey All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
ross Diverse.
the_stripper Did anybody call for security?
chandler You be cool.
the_stripper Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
ross Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
chandler Way to be cool, man.
the_stripper What's he talking about?
joey There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
the_stripper Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
the_guys Yeah!
ross We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
the_stripper Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
chandler Marry me.
joey I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
rachel I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
phoebe Well, do you see any babies?
monica How do you feel?
phoebe Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
rachel Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
phoebe I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
monica Some moms do that.
phoebe Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
monica Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
phoebe Yeah, okay.
rachel No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
monica I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
rachel And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
phoebe Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
monica Yeah.
rachel And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
phoebe They are gonna love me.
rachel Oh!
phoebe Thanks you guys! Again.
monica Oh, sweetie!
phoebe You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
monica_and_rachel What?!
phoebe Just kidding. Ahh!
rachel What?!
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
joey If anything should happen to him
ross Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
joey So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
chandler He will, Joe.
joey Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
joey I'm so worried about him, y'know?
the_doctor Somebody lose a ring?
ross Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
joey H-h-h-how's the duck?
the_doctor He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
joey Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
ross No, that's all right.
joey No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
chandler Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
joey Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
chandler No, you should.
joey Now, don't argue with me
ross Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
chandler Really?
joey Really?
ross Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good
