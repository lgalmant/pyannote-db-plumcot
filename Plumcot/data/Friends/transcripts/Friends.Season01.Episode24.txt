phoebe_buffay Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
rachel_green Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
dr_ross_geller That would be nice.
rachel_green Pardon?
chandler_bing Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.

joey_tribbiani Oh, just, y'know.... science.
dr_ross_geller Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
joey_tribbiani .. It's a fertility study.
monica_geller Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
joey_tribbiani Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.

joey_tribbiani Oh, OK.
phoebe_buffay So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
monica_geller Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
joey_tribbiani What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
monica_geller Man's got a point.
joey_tribbiani Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
chandler_bing Crazy bitch.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
monica_geller Joey... we always know what you mean.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
dr_ross_geller I'm going to China.
phoebe_buffay Jeez, you say one thing, and...
monica_geller You're going to China?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo-it's-it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary Um... here's a picture of me...
phoebe_buffay Oh, let me see!
dr_ross_geller : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
monica_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
dr_ross_geller Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
monica_geller Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
monica_geller You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
dr_ross_geller No.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
dr_ross_geller At the coffeehouse, right.
phoebe_buffay So you do know who he is! Sorry.
dr_ross_geller OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller ...I have to go to China.
joey_tribbiani The country?
dr_ross_geller No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
chandler_bing Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
dr_ross_geller Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
joey_tribbiani Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
chandler_bing Forget about her.
joey_tribbiani He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
chandler_bing Course there, they just call it food.
dr_ross_geller Yeah... I guess. I don't-I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
joey_tribbiani Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
dr_ross_geller I know.
joey_tribbiani We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
chandler_bing I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
melanie Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
joey_tribbiani Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
chandler_bing Ooooh.
monica_geller OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
rachel_green Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
monica_geller Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
joey_tribbiani Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
joey_tribbiani Then you do. Heh, heh.
monica_geller So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
joey_tribbiani What do you mean?
monica_geller Y'know, just be there for her.
joey_tribbiani Not following you.
monica_geller Think about it.
rachel_green OK, I'm guessing this is from...
rachel_green Well, thank you, Melanie.
chandler_bing OK, this one right here is from me.
rachel_green OK... ah, it's light.....it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
rachel_green This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
joey_tribbiani : That book got me through some tough times.
melanie There is a little child inside this man!
chandler_bing Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
rachel_green Who's this from?
chandler_bing Oh, that's Ross's.
rachel_green Oh..... Oh my God. He remembered.
phoebe_buffay Remembered what?
rachel_green It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
chandler_bing Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
monica_geller I can't believe he did this.
chandler_bing Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
rachel_green What did you just say?
chandler_bing ahem... um... Crystal duck.
rachel_green No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
chandler_bing F-hah.... flennin....
rachel_green Oh.... my God.
chandler_bing Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
joey_tribbiani That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
rachel_green I mean, this is unbelievable.
phoebe_buffay I know. This is really, really huge.
chandler_bing No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
phoebe_buffay Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
chandler_bing OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
monica_geller I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
rachel_green No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
joey_tribbiani Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
rachel_green Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
chandler_bing H-He's in China!
joey_tribbiani The country.
monica_geller No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
chandler_bing What about the time difference?
monica_geller From here to the airport?
chandler_bing Yes! You're never gonna make it!
monica_geller Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
rachel_green I-I-I don't know.
chandler_bing Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
joey_tribbiani He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
monica_geller Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
rachel_green I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
phoebe_buffay Here, look, alright, does this help?
rachel_green Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
chandler_bing Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
flight_representative Alright!
dr_ross_geller Ni-chou chi-ma!
rachel_green Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
flight_representative Hi!
rachel_green Hi.
flight_representative May I see your boarding pass?
rachel_green Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
flight_representative Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
rachel_green No, I know, but I-he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
flight_representative No no no! Federal regulations!
rachel_green OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
flight_representative Alright. What's the message?
rachel_green Uh... I don't know.
flight_representative Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
man#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode24 What?
flight_representative It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
man#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode24 : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
melanie Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
joey_tribbiani Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
melanie Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
joey_tribbiani Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
melanie M-Me again?
joey_tribbiani Sure! Why not?
melanie Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
melanie Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
joey_tribbiani How do you mean?
melanie I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
monica_geller Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
rachel_green I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Sure.
rachel_green I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
monica_geller Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
monica_geller Another good point.
phoebe_buffay No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
rachel_green Huh?
phoebe_buffay Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
monica_geller Why isn't it working out?
rachel_green I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
monica_geller Is he not cute enough for you?
rachel_green No!
monica_geller Does he not make enough money?
rachel_green No, I'm just....
phoebe_buffay Maybe there's someone else.
rachel_green Wha...
monica_geller Is there? Is there someone else?
rachel_green No! There is.. there is noone else!
monica_geller Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
chandler_bing Hey, big...
joey_tribbiani Shhhh!
chandler_bing ..spender.
joey_tribbiani She's still asleep.
chandler_bing So how'd it go?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
chandler_bing The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
joey_tribbiani Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
chandler_bing Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
joey_tribbiani It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
chandler_bing I didn't know you had another level.
joey_tribbiani I know! Neither did I!
monica_geller Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller Oh, from who?
rachel_green From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
monica_geller Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
rachel_green Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this-this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
monica_geller Oh, why?
rachel_green Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
monica_geller No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
rachel_green Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
monica_geller I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
rachel_green Who is it?
intercom#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode24 It's me, Carl.
rachel_green C'mon up.
monica_geller Behind my brother's back?. is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
joey_tribbiani Seven hundred bucks!
chandler_bing Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
joey_tribbiani Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
chandler_bing Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
joey_tribbiani What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
carl I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
rachel_green Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
dr_ross_geller Fine, just stop thinking about me.
dr_ross_geller Can't do it, can you?
rachel_green So I'm thinking about you. So what?
dr_ross_geller I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
rachel_green Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
carl I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
dr_ross_geller Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
rachel_green Ross, it's too hard.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
rachel_green Ross, you're like my best friend.
dr_ross_geller I know.
rachel_green If we broke up, and I lost you...
dr_ross_geller Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
rachel_green Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
dr_ross_geller No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
rachel_green I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
dr_ross_geller Well, start looking.
rachel_green Wow.
carl Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
rachel_green Right! You're right!
carl Heh... y'know?
rachel_green You know what?
carl What?
rachel_green I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I mean-I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
carl But...
rachel_green Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
man#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode24 For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
julie Oh, thanks, sweetie.
dr_ross_geller No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
julie Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
julie You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
dr_ross_geller No, no, they will. I just... uh...
dr_ross_geller@julie Can't wait.
dr_ross_geller Come on, they're gonna love you.
