phoebe_buffay Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
rachel_green Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
dr_ross_geller Rach!
rachel_green Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
dr_ross_geller It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller You're bleeding.
rachel_green I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
dr_ross_geller Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
rachel_green These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
julie Thank you. I'm from New York.
rachel_green Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
chandler_bing No way!
monica_geller I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
phoebe_buffay Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
joey_tribbiani Um, this?
phoebe_buffay Yes.
monica_geller Guys, you got your hair cut.
chandler_bing Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
phoebe_buffay 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
rachel_green Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
chandler_bing Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
rachel_green You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
dr_ross_geller That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
joey_tribbiani What up?!
dr_ross_geller Everyone, this is Julie.
rachel_green Julie.
all@ Ohh. Hi!
julie Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
dr_ross_geller And bus.
julie Oh my god.
dr_ross_geller The screaming guy?
julie And the spitting?
dr_ross_geller You gotta hear this story.
julie We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
dr_ross_geller 200 at least.
julie ..and this guy...
rachel_green And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
monica_geller This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
julie Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
dr_ross_geller But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
rachel_green Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
monica_geller It's an expression.
dr_ross_geller Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
julie And then we've gotta get some sleep.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
chandler_bing Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
rachel_green Bye.
dr_ross_geller Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
rachel_green Yeah, sure.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
chandler_bing Hey, Rach, can I get...
rachel_green Did you talk to him?
chandler_bing Not yet.
rachel_green Then, no.
chandler_bing So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
dr_ross_geller I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
chandler_bing God?
dr_ross_geller It was you, pal.
chandler_bing Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
dr_ross_geller Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
chandler_bing Well, you owe me one, big guy.
rachel_green Here's your lemonade.
dr_ross_geller I didn't order lemonade.
rachel_green Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
dr_ross_geller But...
rachel_green Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
chandler_bing He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
rachel_green How is that the silver lining?
chandler_bing You have to really wanna see it.
dr_ross_geller Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
monica_geller Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
monica_geller No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
phoebe_buffay All right, so what were you thinking?
monica_geller Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
phoebe_buffay Ohh! No.
monica_geller Why not?
phoebe_buffay Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
monica_geller No you're not.
phoebe_buffay I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
joey_tribbiani Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
dr_ross_geller Hello? Hi.
chandler_bing Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
joey_tribbiani Needs some clothes altered?
chandler_bing No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
joey_tribbiani Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
chandler_bing Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
rachel_green She didn't hang up either!
dr_ross_geller Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
rachel_green Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
dr_ross_geller Rachel! I'll just call her back.
rachel_green Okay!
dr_ross_geller Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
rachel_green Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
monica_geller Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
rachel_green I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
chandler_bing Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
joey_tribbiani You know, I think I was sixteen.
monica_geller Please, just a little bit off the back.
phoebe_buffay I'm still on "no."
rachel_green Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
phoebe_buffay What's goin' on?
rachel_green Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
chandler_bing What stupid thing did you do?
paolo Bon giorno tutti!
phoebe_buffay Ewww!
rachel_green Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
monica_geller Rachel, how did this happen?
rachel_green I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
phoebe_buffay Where?
rachel_green At his apartment. Is this juice?
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
rachel_green Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
monica_geller Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
chandler_bing People do stupid things when they're upset.
monica_geller My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
all@ Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi. Sorry we're late but we were-well, there was touching.
paolo Hey, hey Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
paolo I do Raquel.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, he's back.
rachel_green Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
dr_ross_geller No, not a problem.
rachel_green Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
phoebe_buffay Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
chandler_bing Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
chandler_bing Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
monica_geller You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
phoebe_buffay All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
monica_geller I promise.
phoebe_buffay All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
phoebe_buffay All right, that's it, I quit.
monica_geller What? I didn't say anything.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
monica_geller I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
phoebe_buffay Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
monica_geller How who wears it?
phoebe_buffay Demi Moore.
monica_geller Demi Moore is not a he.
phoebe_buffay Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
monica_geller That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Oh!
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
monica_geller She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
phoebe_buffay Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
monica_geller I know!
frankie How long do you want the cuffs?
chandler_bing At least as long as I have the pants.
frankie I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
rachel_green How is she?
phoebe_buffay It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
dr_ross_geller How's the hair?
phoebe_buffay I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
joey_tribbiani Can we see her?
phoebe_buffay Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani How're you doing?
rachel_green I'm okay.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, that bad, huh?
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
rachel_green When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
joey_tribbiani You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
rachel_green Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
joey_tribbiani What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
rachel_green I don't know, I don't know.
joey_tribbiani Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
chandler_bing Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
joey_tribbiani Frankie? What're you talking about?
dr_ross_geller Hey, what's goin' on?
chandler_bing Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
chandler_bing Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing Cupping.
joey_tribbiani That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
joey_tribbiani What? That's not? Oh my God.
monica_geller Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
dr_ross_geller I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
monica_geller Thank you. My hair is very amused.
chandler_bing Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
rachel_green Wait, are you leaving?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
rachel_green Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
dr_ross_geller Okay.
joey_tribbiani Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
chandler_bing That's ok.
dr_ross_geller What's goin' on?
rachel_green Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
dr_ross_geller Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
rachel_green No. No-no-no-no.
dr_ross_geller Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually-I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
rachel_green No, I think that was the whole all.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay. Okay.
joey_tribbiani I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
julie I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
julie Really?
phoebe_buffay You wanna do it right now?
julie Great!
phoebe_buffay Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
rachel_green No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
rachel_green You're welcome.
