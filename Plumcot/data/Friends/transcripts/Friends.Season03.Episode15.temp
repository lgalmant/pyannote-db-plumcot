ross What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
rachel No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
phoebe Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
monica Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
phoebe Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!

chandler Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
joey God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
chandler Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
joey Dude, I don't know.
chandler She was kidding.
joey Yeah.
chandler She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
joey Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
chandler Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
joey Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
chandler Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
joey Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
chandler Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
rachel No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
ross Hi!
rachel Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
ross Well you said you couldn't go out so....
sophie You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
rachel Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
ross Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
rachel Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
ross Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
rachel But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
sophie I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
ross Yeah!!
rachel Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
ross Pepper?
rachel None for me.
ross Okay sorry, whew.
rachel I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
ross Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
rachel Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
ross I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
rachel Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
ross Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
rachel I don't have ten minutes!!
ross What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
rachel Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
ross Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
rachel Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
ross Yeah, but wait...
rachel Good bye!
sophie Actually, that's our three hole punch.
ross Hey.
rachel Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
ross No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
rachel I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
ross For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
rachel You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
ross Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
rachel But I told you, I didn't have the time!
ross Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
rachel Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
ross No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
rachel Just a job!
ross Yes.
rachel Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
ross No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
rachel Well neither do I!
ross Is this about Mark?
rachel Oh my God.
ross Okay, it's not, it's not.
rachel Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
ross Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
rachel I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
ross Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
rachel No. A break from us.
chloe And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
chloe Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
ross Oh, hi Chloe.
chloe I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
chandler And that's the only colour that comes in.
issac Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
chloe Oh!
chandler So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
ross Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
monica Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
mischa Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
monica Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
phoebe Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
phoebe You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
mischa Boutros Boutros Gali.
mischa He says he was too.
phoebe Interesting.
mischa So I was wondering....
phoebe Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
mischa Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
monica I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
mischa Oh, really.
phoebe Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
monica Well, I was having a conversation.
phoebe Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
monica What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
phoebe That would be great. Thank you.
rachel Hello!
mark Oh, hi. It's Mark.
rachel Oh.
mark What? Is it my breath?
rachel No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
mark Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?

rachel Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
mark It's for me.
rachel Oh. Okay, bye.
joey So what are you gonna do?
ross What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
chandler Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
ross Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
chandler Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
chandler Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
joey Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
chandler Why? What happened to him?
joey Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
rachel Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
mark Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
rachel No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
mark Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
rachel Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
rachel Hello.
ross Hi! It's me.
rachel Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
ross Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
mark Hey, what do you want to drink?
ross Who's that?
rachel Nobody.
mark Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
ross Is that Mark?
rachel Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
ross Yeah! Got it!
chloe Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
ross Ah, that's okay, thanks.
chloe Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
ross Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
chloe Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
mischa And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
monica Oh. Can I have a tissue?
phoebe Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
mischa Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
phoebe Well, tell him, apology accepted.
mischa Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
phoebe Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
monica Hey, the man's dog just died.
mischa I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
monica It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
sergei Uh, plate?
phoebe Plate! Yes, plate.
sergei Plate. Plate. Plate.
phoebe See, we don't need them.
sergei Plate?
phoebe Yeah.
ross I like this song.
chloe Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
ross Oh, no, no.
chloe What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
rachel Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
