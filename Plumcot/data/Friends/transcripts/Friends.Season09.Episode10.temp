phoebe ..sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
joey Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
phoebe Uh-huh.
chandler Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
monica I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
ross You're really not coming back?
chandler Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
monica It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
chandler So, who does?
phoebe Oh, I like my job.
joey I 'love' my job.
rachel Yeah, I can't 'wait' to go back to work.
ross I can't get 'enough' dinosaurs!
chandler I'm sorry, I won't be here.
monica It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
chandler Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
monica You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
chandler Did I not mention that?
monica No!
chandler AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!
chandler All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's 'no' call for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
wendy Hey!
others Hey.
chandler Hey. Where've you been?
wendy I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
chandler You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
claudia My kid's in a play right now.
chandler Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
ken "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
chandler Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
wendy 'Now' it feels like Christmas.
chandler I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
ken You can come to my house!
chandler Haha, no thanks!
wendy That was a nice pep-talk.
chandler Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
wendy So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
chandler Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
phoebe So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.
rachel Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
chandler I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
phoebe Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
rachel We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
chandler What? That's terrible!
phoebe No-no, we do it every year!
chandler Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
phoebe No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
rachel Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
chandler No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
phoebe Oh no, we have to!
chandler No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
phoebe Well then, you should look with us.
chandler Why?
rachel Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
chandler No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
phoebe Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah.
rachel Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
chandler If I help, we can find 'em faster!
rachel That's right!
phoebe Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
rachel Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
rachel Oh.
phoebe Ooh, who's it for?
rachel "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
joey Rach, these are for you.
rachel Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
joey No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
chandler OK, Pheebs, your turn.
phoebe Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
joey Uh-huh.
phoebe You guuuyys.
joey And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
ross You got me a cola drink?
chandler And, a lemon lime.
ross Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
chandler And last but not least.
joey They're ribbed for 'your' pleasure.
ross Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
ben Cool!
ross Yeah!
monica Come on Ben.
ross Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
chandler Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
ben Santa!
chandler Hey!
ross What are you doing here, Santa?
chandler Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
ross I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
chandler What?
monica Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
ross What are you doing?
chandler You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
ross Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
chandler Why?
ross Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
chandler But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
ross I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
chandler Fine, I'll give the suit back.
monica Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
chandler Santa? Really?
monica Yeah, is that okay?
chandler Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
monica No.
chandler Then it's okaaay!
chandler You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
chandler Did I not tell 'anyone' about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
chandler Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
wendy Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
chandler Ah. Thanks.
wendy Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some 'pissed off' insurance people looking for that ham.
chandler Ah. Chandler Bing.
monica Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
others Merry Christmas!
phoebe Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
chandler Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
monica So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
chandler Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
monica Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
chandler It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
monica Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
chandler I sent them home.
monica Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
chandler Uhh, uh...
ross Answer faster, answer faster!
chandler I don't know!
ross Answer better, answer better!
chandler I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
monica What does she do there?
chandler Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
monica She did WHAT?
chandler BE-LOW me!
joey Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
monica 'What'??
chandler Well, she... she didn't win...
monica Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
chandler Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of 'all' the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
rachel Oh Chandler, stop talking!
chandler Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
monica Okay.
chandler I'm serious!
monica Okay!
chandler Merry Christmas.
monica Merry Christmas.
chandler Merry Christmas, you guys!
others Yeah, Merry... Christmas.
phoebe Blah blargah, blar-blab.
chandler The wife says "Hi!".
wendy Ah. Fun conversation?
chandler Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
wendy Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?
chandler This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
chandler Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
wendy ..Missy?
chandler I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me!.. Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
wendy You are to me...
chandler No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
wendy So? I'm married.
chandler I'm 'happily' married.
wendy Oh. - What's 'that' like?
chandler Right. So, I'm sorry...
wendy Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was.. happy?
chandler Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money!.. You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now,..she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
wendy Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
chandler I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
monica Really?
chandler You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
monica Well, not anymore.
chandler But we don't do that.
monica I know, I just thought it would be fun.
chandler How drunk are you?
monica Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
chandler That's the perfect amount!
monica Okay!
monica Y'know what's weird?
chandler What?
monica This doesn't feel weird!
chandler I know.
monica You're a really good kisser.
chandler Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
monica Hm-hmm!
chandler Okay!
monica Wow! You are really fast!
chandler It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica We're gonna see each other naked.
chandler Yep!
monica Do you wanna do it at the same time?
chandler Count of three?
monica One!
chandler Two!
monica Two!
both Three!
chandler Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
monica Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
chandler Eh!
chandler So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
monica Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
chandler Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am 'so' bad at this.
monica I think you're better than you think you are.
chandler Really? Okay, so...
monica Know when to stop.
chandler Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
monica Yeah. Don't do the dance.
chandler Right!
monica I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
chandler Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
monica You're so efficient. I love you!
chandler Let's go!
monica No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
chandler Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
monica That'll work!
chandler I don't think so.
monica Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
chandler Here just...take this.
monica That's stealing!
chandler No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
monica Ohh.
chandler Okay, one thing at a time.
monica Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
chandler Ehh.
monica Eh, you work for that.
chandler Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
monica You do?!
chandler Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
monica Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
chandler Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
monica You thought about that?
chandler Yeah.
monica How many kids were we gonna have?
chandler Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
monica What else did you think about?
chandler Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
monica Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
chandler Sure you do.
monica No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
chandler You sure?
monica Uh-hmm.
chandler I love you so much.
monica I love you.
rachel Oohh, I love it!
ross Really? You're not gonna return it?
rachel Well, not this second!
phoebe Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
rachel Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
ross Wow, it really is!
monica "Wendy" is a fat girl name.
phoebe Aren't we done with that?
monica Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
chandler Hey!
ross Oh my god...
joey Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
monica What are you doing here?
chandler I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
joey Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
chandler Monica.
joey Got ya.
chandler I never want to leave you again!
monica But I thought if you left, you get fired.
chandler Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
monica What?
ross What, you, you really quit your job?
chandler Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he 'really' wants to do?
rachel What do you really want to do?
chandler I have 'not' thought this through!
monica Oh my god!
chandler I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
monica No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
chandler Thanks!
phoebe Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
chandler Ahh...
phoebe Now give me my real gift.
phoebe Thank you.
chandler Here, pass these, will ya..
ross Oh, hey...
ross "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
rachel Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
chandler I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
joey Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
chandler I don't have a 'job'!
chandler Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. 'You' are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
monica You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
