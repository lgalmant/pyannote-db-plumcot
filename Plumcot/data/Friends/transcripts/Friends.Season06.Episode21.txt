rachel_green Okay, Chandler!
chandler_bing Okay.
rachel_green And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
chandler_bing Oh, well thank you in advance.
rachel_green Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
monica_geller You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
rachel_green Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys!
chandler_bing Hey!!
rachel_green Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
chandler_bing Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
joey_tribbiani Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
phoebe_buffay No! Joey, you're going to be great!
joey_tribbiani But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
monica_geller I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
phoebe_buffay I'll be waiting.
chandler_bing Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
phoebe_buffay No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
rachel_green Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
phoebe_buffay Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.

dr_ross_geller Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.

dr_ross_geller Eh-wh-Excuse me?
paul_stevens Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?

paul_stevens 1 minute 50 seconds.
dr_ross_geller Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.

monica_geller Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Not looking for dates.
elizabeth_stevens So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
monica_geller And he's a great brother!
paul_stevens I had a sister.
monica_geller Ohh!
paul_stevens She passed away.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Ohh!
paul_stevens Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
chandler_bing But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
paul_stevens A part of him did yes.
dr_ross_geller Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.

monica_geller No, you said the baby creeps you out.
chandler_bing No, the little girl creeps me out.
monica_geller You said the baby.
chandler_bing Why would the baby creep me out?
monica_geller Why would the little girl creep you out?
phoebe_buffay You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
chandler_bing This is going in your book?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
monica_geller What?! Excuse me!
phoebe_buffay And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
rachel_green Oh hi!
paul_stevens Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
rachel_green Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
paul_stevens No.
rachel_green All right!
paul_stevens Oh, here they are right here.
rachel_green Oh good.
paul_stevens Thanks for your help.
rachel_green Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
paul_stevens Just call me Paul.
rachel_green Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
paul_stevens Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
rachel_green You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
paul_stevens Well, we were very young when we had her.
rachel_green Oh. We?
paul_stevens Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to
rachel_green Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
paul_stevens I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
rachel_green Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
paul_stevens Yes I did.
rachel_green Ohh. Ooh!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller How was your first day?
joey_tribbiani Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
chandler_bing Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
joey_tribbiani Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
phoebe_buffay Well, why don't you just get him fired?
joey_tribbiani I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
estelle_leonard Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
joey_tribbiani Wow!
estelle_leonard The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
joey_tribbiani I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
estelle_leonard Uh-oh!
dr_ross_geller Joey?!
paul_stevens Hi Ross.
rachel_green I was just getting him to like you.
dr_ross_geller Joey?! Joey!!
rachel_green Ross, Joey is not here.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
rachel_green Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
paul_stevens Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
dr_ross_geller Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
paul_stevens Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
rachel_green Bye!
paul_stevens I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
dr_ross_geller What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
rachel_green Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them
dr_ross_geller In your mouth?!
rachel_green No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
dr_ross_geller You were at the coffeehouse!
rachel_green Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
dr_ross_geller He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
rachel_green Wh-You dated my sister!
dr_ross_geller That was different!
rachel_green What? Why?!
dr_ross_geller This is weird for me!
rachel_green Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
dr_ross_geller How is that important?
rachel_green Oh it's important!
joey_tribbiani Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
monica_geller Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
joey_tribbiani Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
monica_geller No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
joey_tribbiani That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
chandler_bing So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
monica_geller Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
chandler_bing Yeah, you wish.
phoebe_buffay "You wish."
monica_geller Phoebe, stop writing about us!
phoebe_buffay I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
chandler_bing Who?
phoebe_buffay Marcia and Chester.
monica_geller Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
chandler_bing Hmm.
monica_geller Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
chandler_bing Oh.
phoebe_buffay I see what you're doing!
monica_geller Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
chandler_bing Oh-oh.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
joey_tribbiani Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
wayne Don't touch him!
joey_tribbiani Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
rachel_green So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
elizabeth_stevens What a nice story!
paul_stevens So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
rachel_green Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, take your time.
dr_ross_geller Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as
paul_stevens Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
dr_ross_geller Not all bad.
paul_stevens And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
paul_stevens I beg your pardon?
dr_ross_geller No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
paul_stevens You have a son?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
paul_stevens Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
rachel_green Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
dr_ross_geller You're back.
paul_stevens You two were married?!
rachel_green Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
monica_geller Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
chandler_bing We said seven!
monica_geller We said six!
chandler_bing The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
monica_geller Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
phoebe_buffay Hi!
chandler_bing Oh my good God.
monica_geller Ugh!
phoebe_buffay I know what time you said.
chandler_bing What?!
phoebe_buffay Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
monica_geller What time?
phoebe_buffay Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
chandler_bing What does it say?!
phoebe_buffay I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
chandler_bing Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
phoebe_buffay Thanks! So are you.
chandler_bing I told you I should not wear this color.
phoebe_buffay Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
chandler_bing So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
phoebe_buffay That's right.
monica_geller Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
phoebe_buffay Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
chandler_bing Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
wayne Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
joey_tribbiani Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
chandler_bing Hi, how are ya?
wayne Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
joey_tribbiani Why should I help you?!
chandler_bing The reason he just said.
joey_tribbiani What do you need?
wayne I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
wayne I wish I could talk to her.
joey_tribbiani What are you in love with her or something?
wayne Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
chandler_bing Yeah, I've been there my friend.
wayne Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
joey_tribbiani Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
rachel_green I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
paul_stevens How to make the next one even shorter?
rachel_green Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
paul_stevens Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
paul_stevens Are you yelling at me?!
dr_ross_geller God no!
elizabeth_stevens Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
paul_stevens Really?!
dr_ross_geller Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
paul_stevens Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
dr_ross_geller That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
paul_stevens Then we agree?
dr_ross_geller Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
paul_stevens Neither of us like Ross!
elizabeth_stevens I like Ross.
dr_ross_geller Ohhh! Kids!
rachel_green Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
dr_ross_geller That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
rachel_green Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
joey_tribbiani Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
gunther The shipment never made it through Omaha?
joey_tribbiani You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
