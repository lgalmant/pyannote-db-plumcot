monica Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
chandler You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
monica I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
chandler You're on!
phoebe Hey!
monica What's up?
phoebe Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
ross .. finally...
phoebe Is that Ross?
monica Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
phoebe Sounds like he's with someone.
chandler He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
monica Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
charlie Ooh... Dr. Geller!
ross God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
monica Oh my God, that's Charlie!
chandler She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
phoebe Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
monica I'm not sure about this.
phoebe Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
monica No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
phoebe Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
rachel Ooh... I love Barbados!
joey Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
rachel I know, I'm her!
phoebe Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
monica What?
phoebe Get over here!
rachel ooh...
chandler Wow!
monica Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
monica Thank you.
rachel Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
joey Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
rachel What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
monica I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
chandler How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
monica I'm on it!
chandler Anything?
monica I think I hear curtains closing...
phoebe We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
monica Bedsprings, unmistakable!
chandler You do realise that's your brother?
monica Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
chandler That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
monica Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
chandler Okay Buckwheat!
phoebe You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
ross Weh...'sigh'
charlie uhm... Is everything okay?
ross Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
charlie Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the.. I could just...
ross No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
charlie I uhm... I completely understand.
ross Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
charlie Okay...
phoebe That's the door. He's gone...
chandler And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
monica Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
ross Hey, what are you guys doing?
phoebe Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
monica Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
chandler Bye!
ross Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
chandler He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
ross Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
chandler You got it!
ross Thanks! Thank you!
monica Other wall, people! Other wall!
ross Rach, you there?
joey Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
rachel Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
joey No idea what it means.
rachel Oh... okay, just hide!
ross Rach?
rachel Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
rachel There's no room under the bed.
ross Is everything okay?
rachel Yeah...
ross Hey.
rachel Hi...
ross You know where Joey is?
rachel ..I really don't...
ross Can I talk to you for a minute?
rachel Yeah, sure...
joey I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
phoebe Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
ross And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
rachel Uh-huh... right... yeah...
ross And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
rachel Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
ross Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
rachel That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
ross You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
rachel You would think!
rachel Joey!
joey Is he gone?
rachel How are you doing this?
joey Pssst...
rachel How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
monica_chandler_and_phoebe YE-AH!
phoebe Now, what is this?
rachel Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
phoebe Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
joey Well, he's with Charlie now.
monica Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
joey You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
rachel All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
chandler Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
rachel Sure...
chandler Enunciate!
rachel Get out!
rachel Are they right?
joey Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
rachel Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
joey Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
rachel Although...
joey I like although!
rachel I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
joey Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
rachel Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
joey Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
rachel No...
joey I'm thinking about you...
rachel Yeah...
joey Let's forget about Ross...
rachel Forgotten.
joey What's wrong?
rachel Nothing...
joeys_voice_but_she_sees_ross Seriously... What is it?
rachel Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
joeys_voiceross What's wrong?
rachel Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
joey Well, maybe I can help.
rachelross Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
joey Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
both Yeah
ross Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross You guys ready to go?
chandler Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
ross Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
chandler You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
ross Learn about Jesus...
ross Hey!
charlie So, did you talk to Joey?
ross Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
charlie Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
ross Stop it!
charlie PHD
ross You're filthy!
phoebe Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
ross Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
phoebe Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
monica Check it out!
phoebe Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
chandler Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
monica What do you think?
chandler I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
monica Don't you just love it?
ross Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
charlie It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
ross You've never said that in your life, have you?
charlie Not once.
ross I thought so.
monica And listen to this...
chandler What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
joey Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
chandler Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
joey Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
ross Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
joey I understand...
ross No, I'll do it.
chandler Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
phoebe Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
mike You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
phoebe Aaah... you're not good at this...
mike You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
phoebe No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
mike Oh...
phoebe What?
mike Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
phoebe Why not?
mike I have a date.
phoebe You have a... You have a date? With who?
mike Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
phoebe You have... have a girlfriend?
mike Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
phoebe For how long?
mike Three months.
phoebe Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
mike I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
phoebe Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
mike Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
phoebe You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
ross Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
charlie Okay... Good luck.
rachel Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
joey I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
rachel Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
joey Ooh...
rachel Still nervous?
joey I'm gonna get the lasagna.
ross Hey Rach...
rachel Yeah!
ross Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
rachel Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
ross Hey!
joey Hey!
ross So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
joey Yeah?
ross Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
joey You kissed.
ross Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
joey I saw you.
ross Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
joey Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
ross What?
joey It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
ross Are you serious?
joey Yeah... Now I have something...
ross I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
joey Oh... uh... look... before you...
ross No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
joey I am those things, yeah.
ross You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
joey Dude!
ross Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
joey I can't think of anything.
ross Thanks!
joey Yeah.
rachel So hi!
ross Hi!
rachel So you eh, you talked to Joey?
ross Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
rachel Oh! That's great!
ross Yeah!
rachel Oh, so everything's okay?
ross Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
rachel Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
ross Well, I'm so excited about this.
rachel Really? Excited?
ross Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
rachel Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
joey I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
rachel Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
joey Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
phoebe Hi, Mike's place.
mike Hey, it's Mike.
phoebe Ooh, that was fast.
mike Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
phoebe Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
mike One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
phoebe Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
mike Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
phoebe Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
precious Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
phoebe I... I'm Phoebe.
precious Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
phoebe Enchanté
monica Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
chandler You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
monica Yeah!
chandler So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
monica Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
chandler What are you singing?
monica It's "Bolero" from "10".
chandler It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
monica You what? You said you liked them.
chandler Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
monica Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
chandler Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
monica You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
chandler Hit yourself in the tooth?
monica And the eye!
ross Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
rachel That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
ross Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
rachel Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
ross Okay, shoot!
rachel Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
ross OH NO!
rachel What? What is it?
ross Oh, major shampoo explosion!
rachel Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
ross Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
rachel Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
ross I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
rachel Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
ross Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
rachel Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
ross Duh, you think?
phoebe Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
precious I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
phoebe Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
precious My name is Precious.
phoebe Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
precious I just can't believe this... Why?
phoebe Well, I don't...
precious Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
phoebe Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
precious I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
phoebe Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
phoebe Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
precious I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
phoebe But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
precious He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
phoebe Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
precious Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
precious Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
phoebe You're welcome!
chandler Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
monica Not really.
monica I have a problem.
chandler Really? What happened?
monica Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
chandler You can't move at all?
monica Oh, well, I can move...
chandler If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
monica I guess so...
chandler Some of these look a little frayed.
monica Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
joey Hey!
rachel Hi!
joey So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
rachel Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
joey No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
rachel Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
joey Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
rachel Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
joey I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
rachel No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
joey Yeah! Good night!
rachel Goo--ood night!
joey Good night!
rachel Seriously, good night!
joey Stop saying good night.
rachel Okay.
monica Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
chandler Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
monica Sure, what do you have in mind?
chandler I think you know.
monica Really? I don't really feel like it.
chandler This is what I want to do.
monica Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
chandler She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
