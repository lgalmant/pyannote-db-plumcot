rachel_green Come on Joey!!!
joey_tribbiani Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
rachel_green I can't believe you would say that!
joey_tribbiani Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
rachel_green No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
rachel_green Is he romantic with her?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
rachel_green Are they in love?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
rachel_green You don't know anything.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, I know one thing!
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani They did it right there on the couch.

chandler_bing Sorry man.

dr_ross_geller Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
chandler_bing Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
phoebe_buffay Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
rachel_green Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
phoebe_buffay Exactly! Because it's in the past!
joey_tribbiani Anybody gonna eat that?
monica_geller Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
chandler_bing Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
monica_geller I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
chandler_bing I know, I can do this.
monica_geller Ooh, and I can do this.
both#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode12 We can't do that.

He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
monica_geller Hey, I thought you already had one.
chandler_bing Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
rachel_green Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
chandler_bing Okay, good luck with that.

monica_geller I was frustrated.
chandler_bing It was my racquet.
monica_geller I was frustrated with you!
chandler_bing If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
monica_geller Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
chandler_bing Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
monica_geller I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
joey_tribbiani Maybe we should check the trash chute.
rachel_green Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
joey_tribbiani That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green There he is!
monica_geller Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
dr_ross_geller Just, y'know out.
rachel_green Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
phoebe_buffay What were you doing?
dr_ross_geller I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
rachel_green You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
joey_tribbiani He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
dr_ross_geller Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
joey_tribbiani He hooked up!! Tell us about her!

rachel_green Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
janice So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, nobody's judging you.
janice Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
dr_ross_geller Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
phoebe_buffay You two will have very hairy children.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
rachel_green Ross! Janice?!
joey_tribbiani All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
dr_ross_geller Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
phoebe_buffay So are you actually gonna see her again?
joey_tribbiani Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
dr_ross_geller I am gonna see her again.
joey_tribbiani Damnit Phoebe!!
rachel_green Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
monica_geller My turn? What-what are you talking about?
rachel_green Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
monica_geller Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
rachel_green Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
monica_geller Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
rachel_green All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
monica_geller Me and Chandler?!
joey_tribbiani All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm.
joey_tribbiani All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
phoebe_buffay Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
joey_tribbiani Judge rules, no violation.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
joey_tribbiani What?!
phoebe_buffay Are you serious?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
phoebe_buffay You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We
joey_tribbiani And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
phoebe_buffay No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
joey_tribbiani Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, tough call.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
doug But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
kara So how do you kids like your coffee?
monica_geller Oh, none for me. Thanks.
chandler_bing Just a little bit of sugar.
doug Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
monica_geller How does that laugh not give you a headache?
chandler_bing Oh, you get used to it.
monica_geller Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
chandler_bing So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
monica_geller I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
chandler_bing Oh.
doug Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
chandler_bing What?
doug The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
chandler_bing Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
doug Excuse me?
chandler_bing Well, I just
monica_geller Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
chandler_bing Really?
monica_geller Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
chandler_bing I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
monica_geller I thought you could use the help.
chandler_bing Coffee in a fight!
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
rachel_green Sure! Why?
joey_tribbiani Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
rachel_green What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
chandler_bing All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
monica_geller Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
chandler_bing But we're not ready to tell yet!
monica_geller I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
monica_geller Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
rachel_green Hey! Hi!
monica_geller Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
rachel_green Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
monica_geller Okay great!
rachel_green Yeah!
monica_geller Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
rachel_green Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
monica_geller Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
rachel_green That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller I'll get back to my new job.
rachel_green 'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
chandler_bing Man, she is really gullible.
gunther Here you go.
dr_ross_geller Thanks!
janice Actually, I should get going.
dr_ross_geller Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
janice Yes! Yes! You did!
dr_ross_geller Oh
janice What is wrong now?!
dr_ross_geller This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then
janice I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Sometimes I feel
janice No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
dr_ross_geller Huh?
janice You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
dr_ross_geller Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
janice Well yeah!!
dr_ross_geller OH...MY...GOD!!
janice Are you gonna be okay?
dr_ross_geller I am now.
janice Okay.
joey_tribbiani Umm, hi.
janice Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
dr_ross_geller Dude, we got to talk.
chandler_bing Okay.
dr_ross_geller I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
chandler_bing Why would I be mad?
dr_ross_geller Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
chandler_bing I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
chandler_bing I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
dr_ross_geller All right.
chandler_bing And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
