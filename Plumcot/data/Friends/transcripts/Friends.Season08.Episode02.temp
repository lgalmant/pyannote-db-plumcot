rachel Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
joey Hey!
phoebe Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
joey No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
chandler Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
monica That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
chandler And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
monica Oh yeah, right.
chandler We got the honeymoon.
monica That's not 'til Thursday.
chandler The wedding pictures?
monica They won't be ready for weeks.
chandler Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
monica That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
chandler I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
monica Okay.
chandler What? What did you take a picture of?
joey Nothing! It was something.
chandler Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
rachel Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
chandler Oh.
monica Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
rachel Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
chandler Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
front_desk_clerk Here's a copy of your bill.
monica Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
joey Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
ross Hi.
chandler Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
ross Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
chandler Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
ross Thread!
chandler Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
ross What disposable cameras?
chandler The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
ross No you didn't.
chandler Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
ross Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that.
chandler So you don't have the cameras?!
ross No. Sorry man.
chandler So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
ross Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
chandler Great.
ross In-in three minutes.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
monica No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
phoebe A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
monica A tiny salt shaker!!!
phoebe Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
monica Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
phoebe Oh yeah.
monica Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
phoebe Okay.
monica Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
phoebe Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
monica Or this one!
rachel Hi.
monica Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
rachel Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
monica No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
phoebe Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
rachel Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, 'cause I'm going to tell the father today.
phoebe Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
rachel Ew! No!
phoebe What?! I think he's cute.
rachel Well then you have his baby.
phoebe Believe me I'm trying.
monica Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
phoebe Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
rachel Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
phoebe Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.
rachel Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
phoebe Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
monica What was that bam?
phoebe I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
joey Hey!
rachel Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
joey Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
rachel Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
joey Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
phoebe Oh yeah. That's me.
joey Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
phoebe Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
joey Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
phoebe You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
joey Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
phoebe David Lynn.
joey David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
monica Who's David Lynn?
phoebe Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
ross Chandler?
chandler Hey! Did you find the cameras?
ross No. Did you?
chandler Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
ross Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
chandler Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
ross Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
chandler All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
ross I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
chandler Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
ross No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
chandler Are you serious?
ross I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
chandler Marriage advice? Really?!
ross I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
chandler I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
ross What about the chairs?
chandler She picked those out too.
ross How about the place settings?
chandler That was her.
ross What did you do?
chandler I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
ross Hmm.
phoebe Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
rachel Not yet.
phoebe Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
rachel No! Phoebe, it's not Gunther.
phoebe Thank God, 'cause that hair on a baby
rachel Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
phoebe Why not?
rachel I don't know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, 'I'm gonna tell the father today' and then bam!
phoebe Bus?
rachel No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
phoebe Well-well but it is huge.
rachel I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
phoebe You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
joey Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
monica No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
joey Okay.
monica Give me one more.
joey Okay.
phoebe Hey.
joey Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
phoebe All right.
joey Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
monica Oh my God! Joey!
phoebe Hell yeah! I'll marry you!
monica You can't marry him!
phoebe Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!
monica Phoebe!
joey Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
phoebe I can and I will!
monica She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
joey Oh my God.
phoebe Hey!
monica Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
phoebe It's Joey!
joey Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
phoebe We don't know.
joey Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
monica There's a dude?
joey Yeah.
phoebe Who? Who is it?
joey About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but
phoebe Was that story over?
joey The guy left this.
phoebe Oh my God! I know who the father is
monica People have got to finish their stories!
chandler Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
woman_at_the_wedding Oh! Of course.
man_at_the_wedding Uh, would you take one of us?
chandler Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
woman_at_the_wedding It didn't click.
ross I heard it. I heard it.
man_at_the_wedding But there was no flash.
woman_at_the_wedding Why won't you take our picture?
chandler Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
man_at_the_wedding Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
chandler Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
phoebe Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
rachel What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
phoebe I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
rachel Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
phoebe Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
rachel Uh, let's rip!
phoebe Really? Are you sure?
rachel Oh Phoebe!
phoebe Okay, sorry. Yeah.

tag No. This is my red sweater.
phoebe Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
tag What's going on Rach?
rachel Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
tag Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
rachel Oh, it's just not the right time.
tag It is the right time.
rachel Okay.
tag I'm ready for more.

joey You opened them all?
monica I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
joey Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
monica Yeah. What is that?
joey Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
monica Hey! How'd it go?
joey Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
rachel Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
joey I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
rachel Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
monica So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
rachel No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
joey Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
rachel I'm not?
joey Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
rachel What?
monica What?!
phoebe What?!!
joey Pheebs, give me the ring back!
phoebe No!!
rachel No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
joey I understand.
rachel Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.

monica Wow! That is a great picture!
chandler Eh?
monica Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
ross Huh, didn't see that coming.
chandler Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
monica That would be a good idea.
chandler Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
monica You kissed another woman!
chandler Call it even?!
monica Okay!
ross Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water.
phoebe Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
ross No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I've been looking for this for like a month!
