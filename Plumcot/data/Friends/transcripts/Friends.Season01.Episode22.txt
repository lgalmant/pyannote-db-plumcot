monica_geller Tell him.
rachel_green No.
phoebe_buffay Tell him, tell him.
monica_geller Just...please tell him.
rachel_green Shut up!
chandler_bing Tell me what?
monica_geller Look at you, you won't even look at him.
chandler_bing Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
rachel_green All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
phoebe_buffay Doing it on this table.
chandler_bing Wow!
joey_tribbiani Exellent dream score.
dr_ross_geller Why, why, why would you dream that?
chandler_bing More importantly, was I any good?
rachel_green Well, you were pretty damn good.
chandler_bing Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
rachel_green Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
dr_ross_geller I love it, when we share.
chandler_bing You're okay there?
dr_ross_geller I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
chandler_bing Hello Rachel.
rachel_green Get off.
phoebe_buffay Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. What are you wearing?
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
phoebe_buffay Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
chandler_bing Pirates again?
phoebe_buffay No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
chandler_bing Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
phoebe_buffay What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
chandler_bing Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
phoebe_buffay I could be a secretary.
chandler_bing Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
phoebe_buffay I could do that.
rachel_green What are you playing with?
dr_ross_geller Oh, it's my new beeper.
joey_tribbiani What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
monica_geller Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
dr_ross_geller No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
chandler_bing A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
monica_geller All right, I'll see you guys later.
rachel_green Off to see young Ethan?
monica_geller Thank you.
joey_tribbiani How young is young Ethan? Young?
monica_geller He's... our age.
chandler_bing When we were?
monica_geller Okay, he's a senior in college.
dr_ross_geller College?
chandler_bing Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
monica_geller No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
all@ What?
monica_geller Oh, I can't pass for 22?
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe 25-26.
monica_geller I am 26.
phoebe_buffay There you go.
chandler_bing Can you hear that?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
chandler_bing See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Uh, I'm on.
phoebe_buffay Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
chandler_bing I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
phoebe_buffay Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay Ross says hi.
chandler_bing Ah!
phoebe_buffay This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
chandler_bing Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
phoebe_buffay Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay All right. Bye bye.
chandler_bing Bye bye.
chandler_bing Yes?
phoebe_buffay Whatcha doin'?
chandler_bing Ooh.
monica_geller Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
rachel_green Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green Could tonight be the Night?
monica_geller I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
rachel_green So, did you shave your legs?
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green A-ha!
joey_tribbiani Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
joey_tribbiani All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andrá is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
joey_tribbiani Services? Oh, services.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey. How was the first day?
phoebe_buffay Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
chandler_bing See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
phoebe_buffay No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
chandler_bing Why not?
phoebe_buffay Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
chandler_bing What?!
phoebe_buffay I thought you knew that.
chandler_bing Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
phoebe_buffay Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
chandler_bing What are you talking about?
phoebe_buffay Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
chandler_bing I can't belive it.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
chandler_bing They do me?
phoebe_buffay You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
chandler_bing I don't sound like that.
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh Chandler...
joey_tribbiani Oh... Yeah, you do.
dr_ross_geller 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
joey_tribbiani My scones.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay 'My scones.'
chandler_bing Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
chandler_bing That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
monica_geller Did not.
ethan I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
monica_geller How was that possible?
ethan Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
monica_geller Okay.
ethan Okay.
monica_geller Unless...
ethan What?
monica_geller Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
ethan Yeah, I'd really like that.
ethan Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
monica_geller Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
ethan Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
monica_geller Ethan?
ethan Yeah?
monica_geller Are you a virgin?
ethan Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
monica_geller Really?
ethan Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
ethan Wow!
monica_geller You keep saying that.
ethan You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
monica_geller Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
ethan Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
monica_geller No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
ethan Oh.
monica_geller Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
ethan Huh!
monica_geller But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
ethan Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
monica_geller You're not a senior?
ethan Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
monica_geller Ok...ay.
monica_geller What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
ethan I just had sex.
monica_geller Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
ethan Well, you never told me how old you were.
monica_geller Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
ethan I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
monica_geller Don't say it.
ethan ..in love with you.
monica_geller Really?
ethan Sorry.
monica_geller Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
ethan Who?
dr_ross_geller Okay, Andrá should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
chandler_bing Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
rachel_green No, forget it.
chandler_bing Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
rachel_green All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
joey_tribbiani All right.
dr_ross_geller Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
rachel_green No.
dr_ross_geller You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
rachel_green No, it was just the three of us.
dr_ross_geller Huh!
joey_tribbiani So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
rachel_green You know what?
joey_tribbiani What?
rachel_green There were times when it wasn't even me.
phoebe_buffay That is so sweet, you guys.
dr_ross_geller@phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Hey, Mon.
rachel_green Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?

monica_geller Oh.
dr_ross_geller Are you not seeing him anymore?
monica_geller No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
chandler_bing And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
rachel_green I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
joey_tribbiani Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah.

rachel_green Where are you going?
phoebe_buffay Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
chandler_bing Work people? Nobody told me.
phoebe_buffay No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
chandler_bing You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
phoebe_buffay Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
chandler_bing You think I should?
phoebe_buffay I really do, yeah.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
chandler_bing I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
phoebe_buffay You were great. But they still made fun of you.
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
chandler_bing Then, I don't get it.
phoebe_buffay Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
chandler_bing They do?
phoebe_buffay Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
chandler_bing I just wan't to...
phoebe_buffay No, but you can't.
chandler_bing But I just wa...
phoebe_buffay Uh uh.
monica_geller Aren't you gonna...
dr_ross_geller Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
joey_tribbiani What about Andrá?
dr_ross_geller Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
ethan Hey.
monica_geller That was gonna be my opener.
rachel_green Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
dr_ross_geller I thought that was just a rumour.
rachel_green True story.
joey_tribbiani They're here already?
ethan All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
monica_geller It was.
ethan Then, what's the problem?
monica_geller Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
ethan Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
monica_geller This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
ethan No, don't say it.
monica_geller ..love you.
