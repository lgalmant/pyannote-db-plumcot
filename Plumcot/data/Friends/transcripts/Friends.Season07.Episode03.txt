chandler_bing Hey, you guys!
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Hey!
chandler_bing So, what do you think?
dr_ross_geller About what?
rachel_green Yeah, what?
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
joey_tribbiani Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
chandler_bing I got glasses!
dr_ross_geller Well, you-you've always had glasses.
chandler_bing No I didn't!
dr_ross_geller Are you sure?
rachel_green Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm
joey_tribbiani Feminine.
rachel_green Yes!
chandler_bing No!
monica_geller Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
chandler_bing Really?
monica_geller Yeah!
chandler_bing You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
monica_geller Of course!
phoebe_buffay So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
chandler_bing That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us
monica_geller If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
rachel_green Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
monica_geller Oh, I already have one.
phoebe_buffay Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
rachel_green Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
monica_geller Hey, I know I what I want!
chandler_bing What we want honey.
monica_geller No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
phoebe_buffay You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
monica_geller Uh-huh, yeah.
phoebe_buffay You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
chandler_bing Dying people say the craziest things.
monica_geller I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
phoebe_buffay Break my heart-Oh, all right.
monica_geller Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
chandler_bing Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
joey_tribbiani Ahoy!
chandler_bing Hey! How's the boat?!
joey_tribbiani Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
monica_geller Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
joey_tribbiani Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
phoebe_buffay If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
chandler_bing Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
rachel_green Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
joey_tribbiani You could?
rachel_green Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
phoebe_buffay Your own boat?
rachel_green What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
chandler_bing Do you know what I was thinkin'?
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Nothing, I just like to go like this.
dr_ross_geller Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
chandler_bing Uh why, do you have a lecture?
dr_ross_geller No, why?
chandler_bing Then free as a bird. What's up?
dr_ross_geller My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
monica_geller Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
dr_ross_geller Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
chandler_bing Well, did-did you correct him?
dr_ross_geller No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
monica_geller This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
dr_ross_geller Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
monica_geller Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller He hates to lose.
chandler_bing Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
dr_ross_geller You're not a lefty?
chandler_bing Does anybody know me?!
monica_geller What's wrong Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
monica_geller No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
phoebe_buffay Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
dr_ross_geller Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
chandler_bing Don't worry about it Pheebs.
dr_ross_geller No one got me an engagement present.
phoebe_buffay Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
chandler_bing An old cookie?
monica_geller This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
phoebe_buffay See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
chandler_bing We can't accept this.
phoebe_buffay Why not?
chandler_bing 'Cause it's gross.
monica_geller No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
phoebe_buffay Really?!
monica_geller Yeah! I bet I can do it.
chandler_bing Okay, we owe you a present.
dr_ross_geller Two! I've been engaged twice!
joey_tribbiani Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
rachel_green That is the Coast Guard.
joey_tribbiani What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
rachel_green Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
joey_tribbiani All right.
rachel_green Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
joey_tribbiani Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
rachel_green Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
joey_tribbiani Uh, boat rope.
rachel_green Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, rub it?
rachel_green No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
joey_tribbiani I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh
rachel_green Time's up, now your dead.
joey_tribbiani And deaf!
rachel_green Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
joey_tribbiani Yes.
rachel_green Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
joey_tribbiani I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
monica_geller All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
phoebe_buffay You do?
monica_geller You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
phoebe_buffay That and arrogance.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey! How was sailing?
joey_tribbiani I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
joey_tribbiani Women are mean!!!
phoebe_buffay I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller Hey! How was it?
dr_ross_geller Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
chandler_bing I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
dr_ross_geller And what did he ask you not to call him?
chandler_bing Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
chandler_bing Guys?
dr_ross_geller Over here.
jack_geller Have a seat son. Hey!!
monica_geller Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller You gave my father a lap dance!
chandler_bing Why do they put so much steam in there?!
dr_ross_geller 'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
chandler_bing Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
phoebe_buffay Come on, it's not that big a deal!
chandler_bing Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
dr_ross_geller Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
monica_geller Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
chandler_bing I don't want him to tell this story for years.
dr_ross_geller Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
monica_geller I wasn't escaping.
dr_ross_geller Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
monica_geller I was trying to help out a squirrel.
dr_ross_geller You were trying to eat it!
chandler_bing If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
monica_geller Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
chandler_bing All right, I'm off to see your dad.
dr_ross_geller Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
rachel_green Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
chandler_bing Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
dr_ross_geller Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
rachel_green I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
rachel_green Why not?
joey_tribbiani Because! You're mean on the boat!
rachel_green What? I was just trying to teach you.
joey_tribbiani Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
dr_ross_geller Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
rachel_green Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
dr_ross_geller You have to respect the sea!
rachel_green Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
joey_tribbiani Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
rachel_green Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
joey_tribbiani Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
rachel_green Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
joey_tribbiani Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
rachel_green All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
joey_tribbiani You won't boss me around anymore?
rachel_green I won't boss you around.
joey_tribbiani And you'll be nice?
rachel_green And, I'll be nice.
joey_tribbiani And you'll be topless?
rachel_green And-Joey!
joey_tribbiani Do you want me to learn?!
monica_geller Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
dr_ross_geller Let's give it a shot.
monica_geller Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
phoebe_buffay Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
monica_geller No, just a Friday night.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, these are pretty good.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
dr_ross_geller Which one was that?
monica_geller The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
phoebe_buffay Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
rachel_green Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
joey_tribbiani Ohh yeah.
rachel_green Right?
joey_tribbiani Nope.
rachel_green It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
joey_tribbiani I don't know why you just don't say left.
rachel_green Okay, go to the left. The left!
joey_tribbiani Huh?
rachel_green Just sit over there!!
joey_tribbiani Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
rachel_green No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
joey_tribbiani Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
rachel_green Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
joey_tribbiani Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
rachel_green Joey, come on! We just went over this!
joey_tribbiani Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
rachel_green No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
joey_tribbiani All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
rachel_green What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
joey_tribbiani Why not?!
rachel_green Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
joey_tribbiani Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
rachel_green Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
joey_tribbiani Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
rachel_green No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
joey_tribbiani Well, hey I did learn.
rachel_green Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Come on.
rachel_green Awww
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
rachel_green Left.
joey_tribbiani Damnit!
phoebe_buffay Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
dr_ross_geller Looking up?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
monica_geller Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
dr_ross_geller Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
phoebe_buffay Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
dr_ross_geller That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
phoebe_buffay That's what you think.
monica_geller Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
phoebe_buffay Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
monica_geller What was her name?
phoebe_buffay Nesele Toulouse.
monica_geller Nestle Tollhouse?!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
monica_geller Phoebe, is this the recipe?
phoebe_buffay Yes!! Ohh.
monica_geller I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
phoebe_buffay I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
chandler_bing So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
jack_geller I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
chandler_bing What did you do when they found out?
jack_geller They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
chandler_bing So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
rachel_green Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
rachel_green Ohh we're not sailing.
joey_tribbiani Just pull on it.
rachel_green All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
joey_tribbiani What else?
rachel_green Here you go.
joey_tribbiani Thank you.
rachel_green Oh wow!
joey_tribbiani What are you doing?
rachel_green Ohh, sorry.
joey_tribbiani What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
rachel_green Ohh whoops.
joey_tribbiani Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
