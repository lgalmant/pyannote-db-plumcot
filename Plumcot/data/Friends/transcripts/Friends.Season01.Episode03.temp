phoebe Hi guys!
all Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
ross Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
phoebe Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
all Ohh. Ouch.
rachel What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
monica Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
rachel Since when?
joey Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
chandler Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
phoebe Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
rachel And everybody knows this?
joey Yeah. Cushions the blow.
chandler Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
ross That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
monica Uh, Ross.
ross What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w-....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
chandler "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
joey "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
chandler Hey, that was really good!
joey Thanks! Let's keep going.
chandler Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
joey "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
chandler "Smoke away."
chandler I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
joey What?
chandler Relax your hand!
chandler Not so much!
joey Whoah!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey!
chandler Alright, now try taking a puff.
chandler Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
joey No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
chandler It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
chandler Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
joey Y'miss it?
chandler Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
monica No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
joey That's ridiculous!
ross Can I use.. either thumb?
rachel Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
all Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
rachel Good for me!
joey Y'okay, Phoebe?
phoebe Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
monica What did they do to you?
phoebe It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
ross Easy.
phoebe - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
chandler Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
phoebe Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
joey What are you talking about? Keep it!
phoebe It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
rachel Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
phoebe Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
monica We're with you. We got it.
phoebe Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
rachel Chandler, what are you doing?
monica Hey. Whaddya doing?
all Oh! Oh, God!
ross What is this?!
chandler I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
phoebe Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
chandler And this- is my reward!
ross Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
chandler Okay, so this time I won't quit!
all Ohhh! Put it out!
chandler All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
phoebe Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
monica Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
rachel This Alan again? How's it goin'?
monica 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
joey So when do we get to meet the guy?
monica Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
all Oh, come on! Come on!
monica No. Not after what happened with Steve.
chandler What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
monica Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
rachel Well, then can we meet him?
monica Nope. Schhorry.
monica I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
paula Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
monica I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
paula Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
joey Let it go, Ross.
ross Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
monica Do you all promise?
all Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
monica Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
joey You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
ross Hey, Pheebs.
phoebe 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
rachel What bank is this?
monica Hey. It's him. Who is it?
alan It's Alan.
joey Chandler! He's here!
monica Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
monica Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
alan Hi.
all Hi, Alan.
alan I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
monica Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
monica C'mon!
ross ..I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
all Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
monica Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
all Yeah!
rachel And did you notice...?
the_guys Yeah.
joey Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
phoebe Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
ross ..What shoe?
phoebe From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
ross ..So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
rachel What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
monica Really!
chandler Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
ross You know what I like most about him, though?
all What?
ross The way he makes me feel about myself.
all Yeah...
monica Hi.. how was the game?
ross Well..
all WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
monica Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
joey Alan.
ross He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
rachel I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
chandler Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
monica Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
ross What?
monica .I dunno, a little too Alan?
rachel Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
ross Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
chandler I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
phoebe Hey, Lizzie.
lizzie Hey, Weird Girl.
phoebe I brought you alphabet soup.
lizzie Did you pick out the vowels?
phoebe Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
lizzie Saltines?
phoebe No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
lizzie What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
phoebe I know.
lizzie Weird Girl, what are you doing?
phoebe No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
lizzie No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
phoebe Oh, that's fine, no.
lizzie Would you like my tin-foil hat?
phoebe No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
lizzie Please, let me do something.
phoebe Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
lizzie Okay.
phoebe Okay.
lizzie Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
phoebe No, I'm fine.
lizzie See ya.
phoebe Huh!
ross A thumb?!
all Eww!
phoebe I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
chandler Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
phoebe Does, um, anyone wanna see?
all Nooo!
all Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
rachel It's worse than the thumb!
chandler Hey, this is so unfair!
monica Oh, why is it unfair?
chandler So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing?..I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
joey ..Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
rachel Well, I-I could live without it.
joey Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
ross Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
joey Oh, "you do, do you"?
ross You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
rachel "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
phoebe Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
rachel Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
monica Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
paula No.
monica Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
paula Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
monica Can you believe it?..Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
paula Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
monica I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
paula Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
monica No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
joey Do you have any respect for your body?
ross Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
chandler Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
rachel Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
chandler Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big-.well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
rachel God, he's good.
ross If only he were a woman.
rachel Yeah.
chandler Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
ross Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
monica Hey. Where's Joey?
chandler Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
rachel I think he's across the hall.
monica Thanks.
ross There y'go.
chandler Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
ross Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
phoebe Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
ross Hey, I might!
phoebe Sorry..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
all You're kidding. Oh my God.
phoebe And on my way over here, I stepped in gum...What is up with the universe?!
joey What's going on?
monica Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
joey Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
rachel Uh, Joey..
joey Oh, God!
monica Okay..
all Oh! That was Lambchop!
monica Please, guys, we have to talk.
phoebe Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
monica Alright, we have to talk.
phoebe There it is!
monica Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
ross Is there somebody else?
monica No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
rachel We didn't change..
joey So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
phoebe You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
monica Look, I- I could go on pretending-
joey Okay!
monica -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
ross Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
monica I'm sorry..
chandler Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
rachel I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
monica I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
all Oh, yeah! Right!
monica Are you guys gonna be okay?
ross Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
monica I understand.
alan Wow.
monica I'm, I'm really sorry.
alan Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
monica Relieved?
alan Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
rachel Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
ross Yeah. He could row like a viking.
monica Hi.
all Mmm.
ross So how'd it go?
monica Oh, y'know..
phoebe Did he mention us?
monica He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
ross You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
chandler ..That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
all No no no!
chandler I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
phoebe If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
chandler Yeah, alright.
