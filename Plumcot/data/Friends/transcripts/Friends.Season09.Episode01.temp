rachel Joey.
rachel Oh my God. Okay.
rachel So uh... I guess we should... make it official huh?
joey Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
ross Hey Joey. Hey you.
rachel Hey you.
joey Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy.
ross You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
rachel Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
ross Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
joey No.
ross What?
joey Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
monica Hi! Hey look who's here!
mr_geller Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.
chandler He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
ross Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
mr_geller She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
monica Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
mr_geller So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?
chandler Okay. Wow.
ross Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
rachel I know, I still need to talk to you.
joey Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
phoebe Oh and I need to talk to you.
monica About what?
phoebe To see if know what these guys are talking about.
monica Isn't she beautiful?
mr_geller Look at her, my first grandchild.
ross What about Ben?
mr_geller Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow.
phoebe Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
ross Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
phoebe Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.
ross Yeah right.
phoebe Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.
ross What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
phoebe Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
joey Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
chandler Sure.
joey Dude I just did something terrible.
chandler That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
joey No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
chandler What?! Why does she think that?
joey Because it kinda looked like I did.
chandler Again, what?!
joey Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
chandler As we all are at some point during the day.
joey It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
chandler Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
joey I guess.
chandler And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
joey I know! I know it's awful.
chandler Well, what did she say?
joey She said yes.
chandler Does Ross know?
joey Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
chandler Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
joey Oh, I like that. Yeah
chandler If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
joey Now let's not get carried away.
monica I want a baby.
chandler Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
monica Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
chandler I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
monica Deal!
ross Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
mr_geller Noted.
ross I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
mr_geller Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
ross Actually umm
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hi.
phoebe Are you all right?
rachel Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
phoebe Oh my God! He did it?
rachel Well... did you know he was gonna ask me?
phoebe Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
rachel And you really think this is a good idea?
phoebe I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
rachel I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
phoebe Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
rachel Really?! Even Ross?
phoebe Especially Ross!
joey Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.
ross Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just... I'll come back.
phoebe There he goes, your fiancï¿½e.
rachel I guess so.
phoebe Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
rachel I can't say that I'm surprised.
ross Dad, what are you doing?
mr_geller I think there are people in there having sex.
joey It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
mr_geller Wanna peek?
ross No!
mr_geller Come on!
ross Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.
joey We're not peeking?
mr_geller Well I'm peeking. Oh my God!
chandler Hello sir, you know Monica.
joey Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
rachel Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I... it's beautiful I love it!
joey Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
rachel Hey!
nurse Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
rachel Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
nurse It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.
joey Yowsa!
rachel Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
joey Dear Lord.
rachel I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
joey Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that
rachel Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
joey Y'know, I don't really know her.
nurse Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
joey Are you kidding me?!
rachel It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
joey I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
phoebe Oh hey! Wait up!
ross Hi!
phoebe Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
ross What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
phoebe No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
ross What?
phoebe Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
ross Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
phoebe Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
ross I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
phoebe All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
ross No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.
phoebe And so engaged.
ross What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
phoebe Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
ross I didn't give her that ring!
phoebe Really?
ross No!
phoebe So whose ring is it?
ross It's mine.
phoebe Is it an engagement ring?
ross Yes!
phoebe But you didn't give it to her?
ross No!
phoebe But you were going to propose?
ross No!!
phoebe Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
ross Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe... kinda... wanted ah... start... things up again.
phoebe Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
ross Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
phoebe No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
ross Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and... it does sound like something I would do.
chandler Look, we can't stay in here forever.
monica Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
chandler This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
monica Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
mr_geller Of course. I'll always be your dad.
chandler I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
monica It wasn't fun?!
chandler Why? Why-why-would you - Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
mr_geller Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
monica The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.
mr_geller What?
monica Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
mr_geller Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! I'll guard the door!
monica Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
mr_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?
monica Daddy?!
mr_geller Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip.
chandler That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
mr_geller This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was
monica Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
mr_geller You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
monica I don't feel good right now.
mr_geller But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
chandler Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
monica Hey.
rachel Hey. I need to tell you something.
monica Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
rachel Joey asked me marry him.
monica What?
rachel Joey proposed to me.
monica Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
rachel Well, I-I said yes.
monica What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
rachel I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
monica You can't marry him!
rachel Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
monica Well do you love him?
rachel Sure.
monica Sure?
rachel Yeah, I mean whatever.
monica Honey, the question is... do you really want to marry Joey?
rachel No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
chandler You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
joey No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
chandler Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
joey I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
chandler Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
joey Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
chandler Okay, look, just do it gently.
joey You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.
ross Hey.
rachel Hey.
ross Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement.
rachel Surprised?
ross And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um... I didn't propose to you.
rachel I know.
ross I don't think you do.
rachel You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
ross Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
rachel Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
ross Joey proposed to you?
joey I can come back.
ross Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
joey No.
rachel Yes you did!
joey Actually, technically, I didn't.
rachel Well then why did you give me a ring?
ross Wait! Whoa-whoa, you... you gave her the ring?
joey No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
rachel Yes, you did!
joey No, I didn't!
rachel Yes, you did!
joey No, I didn't!
rachel Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
joey Ahhh!
rachel He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
ross Whoa! You were down on one knee?
joey Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't... I didn't propose!
ross Then what did happen?
rachel Yeah, what did happen?
joey Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
rachel Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
joey No, I didn't!
rachel Yes, you did!
joey No, I didn't!
rachel Yes, you did - Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
joey Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
ross Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
joey I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
rachel Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
joey It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
ross What?!
rachel You were gonna propose to me?
ross Uhh... No.
joey Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
ross But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that - I mean that-that was all, Rach.
joey Dude, step up! I proposed.
ross No, you didn't!
joey Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
nurse Hey, she just woke up! She's hungry. Why don't we give this another try?
rachel Okay.
ross I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
joey I can't believe you're not going to propose!
ross Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
joey Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
rachel Oh my God!
ross What?
rachel She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
joey Ah, it's beautiful.
nurse I'll come back for her later.
rachel Okay.
ross Thank you.
rachel Oh wow, this feels weird.
ross Good weird?
rachel Wonderful weird.
joey Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
rachel Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
joey No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that... Man! That kid is going to town!
rachel She's perfect.
ross We're so lucky.
rachel We really are.
ross Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and... I've been feeling
rachel I know. I know. I've feeling
ross Yeah?
rachel Yeah.
ross Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm... then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
rachel Yeah, maybe.
ross Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we... if... You're wearing the ring.
rachel Wh-what's that?
ross And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
rachel I'm sorry, what?
ross When you thought Joey proposed did... did you say yes?
mr_geller Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
monica Hey dad!
chandler Hey.
mr_geller Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? Thank you.
