ross Come on, don't do this.
monica What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
chandler Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.

ross And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
monica No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
ross Ugh.
monica Oh my god.
ross Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
monica Is your tongue swelling up?

chandler We'll watch him.
ross I don't think tho.
joey What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
chandler I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
ross Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
joey Hat, milk, got it.
ross ??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
joey Consider it done.
chandler You understood that?
joey Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
chandler Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
phoebe Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
rachel Ok.
phoebe I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
terry Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
rachel What's up?
terry F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
rachel But what about Phoebe?
terry Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
rachel Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
terry Uh--
rachel Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
phoebe Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
chandler You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
joey It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
chandler No, I got him.
joey No, seriously.
chandler Oh, seriously you want him?
caroline Hello.
boys Hello.
caroline And who is this little cutie pie?
chandler Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
joey You wanna smell him?
caroline I assume we're talking about the baby now.
joey Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
caroline I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
joey What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
caroline I think it's great you guys are doing this.
chandler Well, we are great guys.
caroline You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
phoebe But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
rachel Honey, I'm sorry.
phoebe And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
rachel Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
phoebe Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
rachel Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
terry I, I don't know.
rachel Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
terry You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
rachel Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
terry Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
rachel Done.
phoebe Really?
rachel Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
phoebe Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
rachel What?
phoebe Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
rachel Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
phoebe Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
rachel Well, but Pheebs.
phoebe No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
ross Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
doctor Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
monica Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
ross Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
monica My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
doctor No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
ross Tho?
ross Ohhh.
monica That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
ross Ok.
monica Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
chandler That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
joey Hey, hey, look at that talent.
chandler Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
girl_1_on_bus Hey, you. He's just adorable.
chandler Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
girl_2_on_bus So what are you guys out doing today?
joey Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
chandler You done?
joey Yeah.
girl_1 Oh, there's our stop.
joey Get outta here. This is our stop too.

chandler Oh, sure, they love us over there.
girl_2 Where's your baby?
chandler_and_joey Ben! Ben! Ben!
chandler Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
both Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
monica Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
doctor No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
ross Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
phoebe .. with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
stephanie Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
phoebe Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
stephanie All of them.
phoebe Oh yeah, so you know D?
stephanie Yeah.
phoebe Ok, do you know A minor?

phoebe Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
stephanie Yeah.
phoebe Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
stephanie No.
phoebe Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
chandler Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
joey Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
rachel Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
phoebe Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
rachel Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
stephanie Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
phoebe You're all invited to bite me!
chandler_and_joey Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
transit_authority_guy He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
chandler That's me.
joey I'm him.
chandler Actually, uh, we're both the father.
both Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
chandler Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
joey Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
chandler Ok.
joey Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
chandler Yeah?
joey Yeah.
chandler Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
joey Ahh!
chandler What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
joey Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
chandler Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
joey You got a better idea?
chandler All right, call it in the air.
joey Heads.
chandler Heads it is.
joey Yes! Whew!
chandler We have to assign heads to something.
joey Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
chandler What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
rachel Hey.
phoebe Oh, hi.
rachel Here. I thought you might be cold.
phoebe Thank you.
rachel Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
phoebe Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
rachel Do you?
phoebe No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
rachel Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
phoebe It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
rachel Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
phoebe Really? From who?
rachel Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
kid Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
phoebe Yeah. Here you go.
kid Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
ross I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
monica That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
ross Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
monica Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
ross Oh.
monica Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
ross Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
monica No. But I remember people telling me about it.
ross I hope Ben has a little sister.
monica Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
ross I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
monica That was you?
ross They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
monica Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
chandler Hey, he's not crying.
joey Yes! There's still pie.
ross I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
joey Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
ross Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
chandler You, you are gonna love this.
ross Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
chandler Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
stephanie Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
phoebe No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
stephanie Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
phoebe Better. Yeah.
stephanie Yeah?
phoebe Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
stephanie Yeah.
phoebe You wanna try it again?
stephanie Yeah. From the top?
phoebe Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
stephanie Ok.
phoebe Mmmm hmmm.
together Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
phoebe That's too much. Sorry.
