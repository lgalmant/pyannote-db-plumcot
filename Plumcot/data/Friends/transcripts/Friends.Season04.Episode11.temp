phoebe Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
frank Oh I know!!
phoebe You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
frank 'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch
phoebe Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
frank We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
phoebe Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
frank Uhh, yeah.
alice We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
frank See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
alice And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
frank Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
phoebe That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
joey Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
chandler I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
ross What?
chandler Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
rachel But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
chandler Well, you-you know what I meant.
monica No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
chandler So what job did you get Joe?
joey Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
rachel Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
joey No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
chandler_monica_and_rachel Great!! That's great!
ross Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
joey Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
phoebe Hey!!
all Hey!
phoebe Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
all Oh my God!!
phoebe And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
ross My God!
monica Are you serious?
phoebe Yeah
joey You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
phoebe Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
joey Huh.
monica What did you tell them?
phoebe Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
chandler You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
rachel Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
monica Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
phoebe I know!
ross Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
phoebe Yeah, what's your point?
ross Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
rachel Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
phoebe Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
joey No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
all Yeah.
monica We just want you to think it through.
rachel Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
phoebe My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
kathy Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
chandler Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
kathy Oh!
monica I am so jealous.
rachel You guys are really right...there aren't you?
chandler Yes. Right where?
monica In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and
chandler Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
monica And the sex?
chandler All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
rachel Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
ross That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
rachel Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
chandler No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
monica Then what is it?
chandler Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
ross And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
chandler No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
ross Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
chandler Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
monica So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
chandler We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
monica Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
chandler Yeah?
rachel Yeah!
ross Just go for it Chandler.
monica Yeah, you should.
rachel Yeah, you should, really.
monica Go on.
chandler All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
joey Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
smart_kid Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
joey Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
phoebe_sr It's open! Come in!
phoebe Hi!
phoebe_sr Hi!
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm late.
phoebe_sr Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
phoebe Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
phoebe_sr No, I was working on my pottery.
phoebe Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
phoebe_sr Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
phoebe Ooh, erotiery!
phoebe_sr Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know
phoebe Okay.
phoebe_sr I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
phoebe Why not?
phoebe_sr Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
phoebe Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
phoebe_sr No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
phoebe Oh, I get a puppy!!
phoebe_sr Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
phoebe Why?
phoebe_sr I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
phoebe Okay.
phoebe_sr I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
phoebe All right, I'm sorry.
joey Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
tour_guide You mean Dr. Geller?
joey Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
tour_guide Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
joey Well, how-how come?
tour_guide That's just the way it is.
joey That's crazy.
tour_guide Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
joey I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
ross That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
tour_guide Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
ross Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
joey It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
ross But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
joey Whatever.
ross It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
monica I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
joey Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
rachel Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
chandler Hi.
monica Hey!
chandler Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
phoebe Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
monica What?!
phoebe Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
monica So, did you do it?
chandler Yes, yes, we had the sex.
monica Uh-oh, it was bad?
chandler It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
monica Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
rachel Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
chandler Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
monica All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now
chandler Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
monica Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
chandler There are seven?!
rachel Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
chandler That's one?
monica It's kind of an important one!
chandler Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
rachel Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
monica Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
chandler That-that's bad?
rachel Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
chandler Well you might if it were anything like 7!
monica All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
rachel Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
monica All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7,..7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
older_scientist Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
ross Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
joey I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
ross Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
joey I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
another_tour_guide I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
ross All right, there you go!
joey Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
older_scientist I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
ross Okay, good-good for you.
tour_guide I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
ross Wow, Rhonda.
another_scientist I'm Scott.
ross Yeah, okay, Scott!
another_scientist And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
phoebe My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
rachel Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
monica Y'know, I never saw that.
rachel Ooh, it was only okay.
phoebe Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
alice Hi!
frank Hi!
alice Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so
frank Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
alice None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
phoebe Okay.
frank Oh, who's this little guy?!
phoebe Oh! Ooh! Umm!
frank Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
alice You are so precious, I could just take you home.
phoebe Hey, why don't you?
frank Are you serious?
phoebe Uh-huh, yeah!
frank Oh, thanks.
monica What are you doing?
phoebe No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
alice Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
frank Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
monica It's gonna be so great.
phoebe_sr Hi! What's going on?
phoebe Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
phoebe_sr But Phoebe
phoebe No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
phoebe_sr Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
phoebe Oh!
monica Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
rachel It depends on who asked.
monica What if I asked?
rachel Oh, Mon, sure.
monica Really?
rachel Yes. You're not asking are you?
monica No.
rachel Yes! Totally!
kathy Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
