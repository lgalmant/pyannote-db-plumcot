chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
joey_tribbiani Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
rachel_green Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, what?
rachel_green Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful
phoebe_buffay Oh!
rachel_green ...how about I move in with you?
phoebe_buffay Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
monica_geller Who's Denise?
phoebe_buffay My roommate.
rachel_green You have a roommate?!
phoebe_buffay Yes, Denise. Denise!
joey_tribbiani Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
chandler_bing Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
phoebe_buffay Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place
rachel_green Oh, that's true.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
rachel_green Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
chandler_bing Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
dr_ross_geller Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
phoebe_buffay You didn't tell her did you?
dr_ross_geller No.
phoebe_buffay Of course not, because you're in love with her.
dr_ross_geller I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
phoebe_buffay What do you mean, comforted her?
dr_ross_geller It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
phoebe_buffay Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
dr_ross_geller It's also a sign of friendship.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
dr_ross_geller It was a hug!
phoebe_buffay Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
dr_ross_geller S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
phoebe_buffay Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
dr_ross_geller I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
phoebe_buffay Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
dr_ross_geller If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
chandler_bing Who was it?
joey_tribbiani I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
monica_geller Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
chandler_bing Sure!
monica_geller Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
chandler_bing Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
chandler_bing So, that's it?
monica_geller I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
chandler_bing Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
monica_geller What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
chandler_bing I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
monica_geller Are you mocking me?
chandler_bing No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
joey_tribbiani Hey, what's up?
chandler_bing Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
joey_tribbiani But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
chandler_bing "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
joey_tribbiani Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
rachel_green Pheebs, I have to ask you
phoebe_buffay Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
rachel_green You're just staring into space.
phoebe_buffay Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
rachel_green This one?
phoebe_buffay It worked!
rachel_green Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
phoebe_buffay Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
rachel_green Yeah! Why?
dr_ross_geller Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
rachel_green That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
dr_ross_geller Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
rachel_green Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
dr_ross_geller Okay, you go grab it!
phoebe_buffay I saw it.
dr_ross_geller I don't know what you're talking about.
phoebe_buffay Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
dr_ross_geller Look, I do not re-love her.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
dr_ross_geller Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
rachel_green Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
dr_ross_geller You can live with me.
rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay What?!
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Oh my God! Are you serious?!
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh.
rachel_green I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
phoebe_buffay Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
rachel_green Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
dr_ross_geller Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
rachel_green Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
dr_ross_geller Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
phoebe_buffay No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
chandler_bing Hi.
monica_geller Hi.
chandler_bing Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women
monica_geller Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
chandler_bing Really?
monica_geller Yeah! Oh yes!
chandler_bing Ohh.
monica_geller Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
chandler_bing That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
monica_geller Totally!
chandler_bing We don't have to come up with this now.
monica_geller Oh good.
chandler_bing Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
monica_geller Changes?
chandler_bing Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
monica_geller You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
chandler_bing Is that a problem?
monica_geller Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
chandler_bing Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
monica_geller See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
chandler_bing Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
monica_geller Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
chandler_bing In the game room!
monica_geller Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
chandler_bing All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
joey_tribbiani Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
the_potential_roommate Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
joey_tribbiani Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
chandler_bing You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
joey_tribbiani Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
chandler_bing Why did you take the shower curtain down?
joey_tribbiani That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
rachel_green Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
dr_ross_geller What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
rachel_green No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
dr_ross_geller What?! Over a stupid room!
rachel_green Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
dr_ross_geller Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
dr_ross_geller What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
monica_geller Ross, we can handle this.
dr_ross_geller Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
chandler_bing Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
dr_ross_geller Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
chandler_bing Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
monica_geller Love is the best medicine.
chandler_bing That's laughter.
monica_geller Why do you do it?
chandler_bing I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
chandler_bing Yeah, I do.
dr_ross_geller And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
monica_geller Yes.
dr_ross_geller Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
gunther So I understand you're looking for a place.
rachel_green No-no, I'm staying put.
gunther Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
rachel_green Why, where are you going?
gunther I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
rachel_green Oh wow.
dr_ross_geller Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
rachel_green Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
dr_ross_geller Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
rachel_green Well, because of us! Because of our history.
dr_ross_geller No!
rachel_green No?
dr_ross_geller No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
rachel_green No! Not at all!
dr_ross_geller Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
rachel_green Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
dr_ross_geller Really?! We are?
rachel_green Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend
dr_ross_geller Ohh! That would be great.
rachel_green But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I didn't think of that.
dr_ross_geller So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
monica_geller That's very funny!
chandler_bing He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
dr_ross_geller No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
monica_geller Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
dr_ross_geller Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm not so worried.
monica_geller Yeah, no, me neither.
dr_ross_geller Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
monica_geller You still want to move in together right?
chandler_bing Of course!
monica_geller Ross didn't scare you?
chandler_bing Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
monica_geller Come here, I want to show you something!
chandler_bing Okay!
chandler_bing Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
monica_geller This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
chandler_bing Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
monica_geller Uh-hmm.
chandler_bing Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
monica_geller Oh my God! I love that!
chandler_bing Really?!
monica_geller Uh, no!!
phoebe_buffay I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair
phoebe_buffay Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
dr_ross_geller So umm, where are the other guys?
rachel_green Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
dr_ross_geller Fighting?!
rachel_green No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
rachel_green Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
dr_ross_geller Sure! Here.
rachel_green Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
joey_tribbiani Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
dr_ross_geller I've been back and forth.
joey_tribbiani Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
dr_ross_geller Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
joey_tribbiani That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
joey_tribbiani I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
dr_ross_geller Is that what I want?
phoebe_buffay Yes.
joey_tribbiani Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
rachel_green All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
joey_tribbiani Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
dr_ross_geller Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
rachel_green Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
joey_tribbiani Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
the_potential_roommate Hi!
joey_tribbiani Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
the_potential_roommate Great!
joey_tribbiani Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
the_potential_roommate I can do that.
joey_tribbiani Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
the_potential_roommate Fight.
joey_tribbiani Very good! Okay. G.
the_potential_roommate String?
joey_tribbiani Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
the_potential_roommate Kitten?
joey_tribbiani Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
