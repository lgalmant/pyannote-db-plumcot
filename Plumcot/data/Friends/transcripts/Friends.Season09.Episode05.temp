phoebe Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
joey Thursday? But that's Halloween.
phoebe So?
joey So spooky, that's all.
ross So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
phoebe No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
rachel Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?
phoebe Oh, Rachel!
ross Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
phoebe Oh, yay!
ross Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
phoebe Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time.
monica What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
rachel Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
monica Oh, dear god!
chandler Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
ken That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
chandler Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?
claudia I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
chandler No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
claudia Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?
chandler Alright, lo'look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.
ken That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke '
chandler Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
ken I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?
chandler I always liked you, Ken.
phoebe Trick or treat!
monica Hey!
phoebe Ooh, and treat it is.
monica Hmhmm.
phoebe Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can't contain my breasts.
monica This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
phoebe Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?
monica Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there.
phoebe 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey'hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
chandler Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
phoebe You smoked!

phoebe Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
chandler Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
phoebe Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound and the breasts of a Greek goddess.

monica Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
chandler No thanks, I'm good.
monica O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
chandler Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
monica You don't need a shower.

rachel What if she jumped out the bassinet?
ross Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
rachel Oh my god, I left the water running.
ross Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
rachel Ah, did I leave the stove on?
ross You never cooked since 1996.
rachel Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
ross Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ' listen, listen!
rachel Ubb.
ross A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
rachel Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
waiter Hello.
phoebe_joey Hey.
waiter It's been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.
joey Maybe we should just eat now.
waiter You can't order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.
joey Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?
waiter Estrangement
joey But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.

maitre_da Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss!
phoebe Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.
joey Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell'uhuhh!
monica Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
chandler Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.
monica Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral
chandler That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
monica No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
chandler Mean it?
monica Yah.
chandler You are incredible. Unless, I-I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
monica D'you want to?
chandler Yeah, let's celebrate life!

ross Great. So let's get going?
rachel Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
ms_geller I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: 'Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you.'
ross Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
chandler Uhh. You are welcome.
monica You know what? Let's not talk.
chandler What?
monica Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
chandler But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes'no big deal.
monica Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
chandler Leave it.
monica I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
chandler You tricked me to get me into bed?
monica That's right, I got mine.
chandler I feel so used.
phoebe Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?
joey Thank you. Waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails.
waiter Er'does not.
phoebe Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
waiter Oh, they're both exclus...
phoebe Both it is, thank you.
joey Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
ross_rachel Hey, hi, hi!
waiter I'll just wait to put your order in.
phoebe You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
ross I'm so sorry '
rachel We got locked out of the apartment, we.
joey That's a great story'can I eat it?
ross And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
rachel N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
phoebe And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
rachel Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
ross What?
rachel She spit up. Judy! She spi Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
ross Thanks. Oh.
rachel Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
joey Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
ross Y'know this ??? is incredible.
joey Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
ross Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
rachel Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
joey And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because - monica Happy birthday!
joey Son of a bitch!
phoebe Wher-where have you been?
monica Well, we had a little fight.
chandler I would never lie to get someone into bed.
monica You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
chandler I suppose that Monica will have the manipulative shrew.
waiter I'll give you another minute.
joey Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
ross Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
rachel Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
chandler You mean the lully story?
ross Huh-huh, they already know it.
phoebe You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
joey No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
monica Why would you do that?
joey Chandler, control your woman!
rachel Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ' to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
phoebe Aw ' what?
rachel N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
monica Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
rachel Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
phoebe 's a good toast.
rachel Could you please get her attention?
ross W-oa ' Mommy!
phoebe Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.
ross Well, ??? think that's us?
phoebe well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?
joey Well, what is going on with you two?
monica Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.
chandler Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
monica Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.
chandler You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
joey So? Did have sex, right?
chandler What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
phoebe Okay, that was Mike.
rachel Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
phoebe Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off.
rachel What?
phoebe Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t'not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.
rachel Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
ross You know, I think that's a good idea'our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys.
monica Bye.
joey See ya. Well, this is just us.
monica_chandler Mhum.
monica So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
chandler So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
joey Do, do you gonna do it now?
monica We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct.
joey No-ohoh.
