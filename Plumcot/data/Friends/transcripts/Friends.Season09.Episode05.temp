phoebe Oh hey you guys, I couldnï¿½t get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
joey Thursday? But thatï¿½s Halloween.
phoebe So?
joey So spooky, thatï¿½s all.
ross So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
phoebe No! Itï¿½s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think itï¿½s a little to soon to show my true colors.
rachel Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross
phoebe Oh, Rachel!
ross Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
phoebe Oh, yay!
ross Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
phoebe Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all havenï¿½t been together the six of us in such a long time.
monica What are you talking about? Weï¿½re all together right now.
rachel Um, Mon, Chandlerï¿½s not here.
monica Oh, dear god!
chandler Good morning everyone, itï¿½s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?
ken Thatï¿½s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
chandler Well, donï¿½t believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, thatï¿½s true. Alright, letï¿½s get started, by take a look at last quarterï¿½s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her
claudia Iï¿½m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
chandler No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I canï¿½t remember why. (to everyone
claudia Yes, in Oklahoma itï¿½s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?
chandler Alright, loï¿½look. I donï¿½t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, itï¿½s fine. So you all smoke then? Thatï¿½s almost rude, that Iï¿½m not.
ken Thatï¿½s not true. If you donï¿½t wanna smoke ï¿½
chandler Ken, please! No, I canï¿½t, I canï¿½t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
ken Iï¿½m sorry, but isnï¿½t your wife back in New York?
chandler I always liked you, Ken.
phoebe Trick or treat!
monica Hey!
phoebe Ooh, and treat it is.
monica Hmhmm.
phoebe Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that canï¿½t contain my breasts.
monica This is not, what Iï¿½m wearing. Iï¿½m ovulating and Chandlerï¿½s gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
phoebe Ohh. Oh wait! you guys wonï¿½t be late for my dinner, will you?
monica Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. Weï¿½ll probably be the first ones there.
phoebe ï¿½kay, see you there. Happy humping! Heyï¿½hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, donï¿½t people know, youï¿½re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
chandler Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
phoebe You smoked!
chandler No! I just happened tï¿½do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
phoebe Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
chandler Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
phoebe Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ï¿½ and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
chandler Pheebs?
phoebe Iï¿½m gonna go.
chandler Okay, something to cover the smell ï¿½ Oven cleaner! Unscented!
monica Welcome home. Iï¿½ve missed you. join me in the bedroom?
chandler No thanks, Iï¿½m good.
monica O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
chandler Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so Iï¿½m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
monica You donï¿½t need a shower.
chandler Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
monica What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huhï¿½did you smoke?
chandler Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packï¿½aï¿½a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But itï¿½s over, I made a decision, Iï¿½m not gonna smoke anymore.
chandler But, those are for you.
ross Alright, weï¿½ll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, sheï¿½s stuck in terrible traffic.
rachel Okay, well thatï¿½s now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
ross Oh, what were the other two?
rachel Well, letï¿½s see. The first one is
ross I know, itï¿½s the first time, weï¿½re leaving the baby and ï¿½ hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ï¿½ but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. Sheï¿½s great with kids.
rachel She is?
ross Ya.
rachel What about Monica.
ross Hey, you only heard Monicaï¿½s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
rachel Ish. I just donï¿½t think I can bear it.
ross Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
rachel Uch.
ross Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why donï¿½t you, why donï¿½t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Iï¿½ll meet you there.
rachel Oh-A.
ross No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
rachel You need to learn some new slang.
ross Iï¿½m serious. Cï¿½mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go.
rachel What ï¿½ Oh!
ross No! No, you know what? You , the babyï¿½s fine, now squam . Yeah, story walking.

ross Oh, holy molly are we in a pickle now.
phoebe Where is everyone? Theyï¿½re forty minutes late.

phoebe Joseph! Thou neednï¿½t worry, they shanï¿½t be long.
waiter Itï¿½s just that we do have some large parties waiting.
phoebe One really does have a stick up oneï¿½s ass. Doesnï¿½t one?
monica How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, itï¿½s chilling.
chandler I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
monica So what? Donï¿½t you have any will power?
chandler Will power? Iï¿½ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
monica You said that was sexy!
chandler ï¿½kay, look
monica Thatï¿½s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
chandler You forbid me?
monica Mhmm.
chandler You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
monica Donï¿½t joke with me, okay? Iï¿½m very, very upset right now.
chandler Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
monica Yes.
chandler Then, I might as well ï¿½ do this . Not really sure what to do now.
monica Well, Iï¿½ll tell you what weï¿½re gonna do
chandler Fine. What!?
monica Sex! This is the last day Iï¿½m ovulating, and when we donï¿½t do it now, weï¿½ll have to wait till next month.
chandler You serious?
monica Oh yeah!
chandler Right, fine, Iï¿½ll do it, but no talking.
monica Huh, and no cuddling.
chandler And no kissing your neck.
monica Oh good, I hate it when you do that
chandler And lots of kissing your neck.
ross Okay, well the ??? is not home.
rachel No. Uch.
ross Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
rachel Alright, I canï¿½t, I canï¿½t wait that long. You have to do somethingï¿½knock that door down!
ross I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, yï¿½you know, everything is gonna be fine. The babyï¿½s sleeping.
rachel What if she jumped out the bassinet?
ross Canï¿½t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
rachel Oh my god, I left the water running.
ross Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
rachel Ah, did I leave the stove on?
ross You never cooked since 1996.
rachel Is the window open? Because if thereï¿½s a window open, a bird could fly in there.
ross Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youï¿½re right. I think ï¿½ listen, listen!
rachel Ubb.
ross A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birdï¿½s aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
rachel Boy, are you gonna be sorry if thatï¿½s true.
waiter Hello.
phoebe_joey Hey.
waiter Itï¿½s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.
joey Maybe we should just eat now.
waiter You canï¿½t order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.
joey Wha-a how about this
waiter Estrangement .
joey But it happens? Iï¿½m gotta go to the bathroom.
phoebe No, you canï¿½t go. No-no-no, I canï¿½t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
joey If you ask me to stay, Iï¿½ll pee.
maitre_d Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss!
phoebe Okay, fine, Iï¿½ll move. Alright, you donï¿½t have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.
joey Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hellï¿½uhuhh!
monica Spend more time with the tie. Thatï¿½ll make a baby.
chandler Look, I canï¿½t do this. I canï¿½t make luv to you while weï¿½re fighting this way.
monica Oh sure, now youï¿½re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncleï¿½s funeral
chandler That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Iï¿½m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
monica No, youï¿½re right. Mnya, we shouldnï¿½t do it like this. Huch. For what itï¿½s worth, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m sorry. I shouldnï¿½t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
chandler Mean it?
monica Yah.
chandler You are incredible. Unless, Iï¿½Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
monica Dï¿½you want to?
chandler Yeah, letï¿½s celebrate life!
monica ï¿½kay.
rachel Och, god. Oh, thank god, youï¿½re okay. Iï¿½m so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
ross Great. So letï¿½s get going?
rachel Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Iï¿½m never leaving her again.
ms_geller I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out
ross Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
chandler Uhh. You are welcome.
monica You know what? Letï¿½s not talk.
chandler What?
monica Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
chandler But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesï¿½no big deal.
monica Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
chandler Leave it.
monica I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnï¿½t have sex with me while weï¿½re fighting.
chandler You tricked me to get me into bed?
monica Thatï¿½s right, I got mine.
chandler I feel so used.
phoebe Well, I guess theyï¿½re not coming. You wanna just order?
joey Thank you. Waiter! ï¿½lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up
waiter Erï¿½does not.
phoebe Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
waiter Oh, theyï¿½re both exclusï¿½
phoebe Both it is, thank you.
joey Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request
ross_rachel Hey, hi, hi!
waiter Iï¿½ll just wait to put your order in.
phoebe You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
ross Iï¿½m so sorry ï¿½
rachel We got locked out of the apartment, we ï¿½
joey Thatï¿½s a great storyï¿½can I eat it?
ross And then Rachel wasnï¿½t sure she could leave the baby.
rachel N-it wasnï¿½t easy, but itï¿½s your birthday and I did what I got to do.
phoebe And thatï¿½s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
rachel Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Iï¿½m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how sheï¿½s doing at home and Iï¿½m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
ross What?
rachel She spit up. Judy! She spiï¿½Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
ross Thanks. Oh.
rachel Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
joey Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
ross Yï¿½know this ??? is incredible.
joey Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
ross Okay, Iï¿½ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
rachel Yah, Iï¿½ll have the soup and the salmon.
joey And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ï¿½
monica Happy birthday!
joey Son of a bitch!
phoebe Wher-where have you been?
monica Well, we had a little fight.
chandler I would never lie to get someone into bed.
monica You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnï¿½t it? How dï¿½you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
chandler I suppose that Monica will have the ï¿½ manipulative shrew.
waiter Iï¿½ll give you another minute.
joey Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
ross Rach, cï¿½mon, Emma is fine. Youï¿½re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
rachel Yï¿½guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
chandler You mean the lully story?
ross Huh-huh, they already know it.
phoebe You guys, weï¿½ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
joey No, no, itï¿½s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
monica Why would you do that?
joey Chandler, control your woman!
rachel Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ï¿½ to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
phoebe Aw ï¿½ what?
rachel N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
monica Momï¿½s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
rachel Ross, she still has not noticed that the babyï¿½s sock is on the ground.
phoebe ï¿½s a good toast.
rachel Could you please get her attention?
ross W-oa ï¿½ Mommy!
phoebe Oh, for godï¿½s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Iï¿½m sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnï¿½t even have the courtesy to call. Well, itï¿½s too late now.
ross Well, ??? think thatï¿½s us?
phoebe well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?
joey Well, what is going on with you two?
monica Uch, you see, Iï¿½m ovulating.
chandler Oh yeah, thatï¿½s what she says. But maybe youï¿½re not ovulating at all, maybe itï¿½s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
monica Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just canï¿½t get enough.
chandler You not gonna believe this
joey So? Did have sex, right?
chandler Whatï¿½s the matter with me? Why Iï¿½m such a girl?
phoebe Okay, that was Mike.
rachel Phoebe, hi, weï¿½re so sorry. Youï¿½re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
phoebe Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Iï¿½m gonna take off.
rachel What?
phoebe Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, Iï¿½m not tï¿½not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.
rachel Oh thank god, if Phoebeï¿½s going, can we please take Emma home?
ross You know, I think thatï¿½s a good ideaï¿½our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, yï¿½guys.
monica Bye.
joey See ya. Well, this is just us.
monica_chandler Mhum.
monica So, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
chandler So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
joey Do, do you gonna do it now?
monica We donï¿½t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ï¿½
joey No-ohoh.
maitre_d I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
joey Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
waiter How was everything, sir?
joey Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
waiter Well, I hope, you got some room left.
waiters Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ï¿½
joey Joey! Joey.
waiters ï¿½ Joey, happy birthday to you.
joey Thatï¿½s the best birthday ever.
