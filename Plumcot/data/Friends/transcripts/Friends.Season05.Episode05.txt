monica_geller Hi!
chandler_bing Hi!
joey_tribbiani Monica? What time is it?
chandler_bing Uhh, 9.
joey_tribbiani But it's dark out.
monica_geller Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
joey_tribbiani I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
monica_geller I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
chandler_bing I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
monica_geller All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
chandler_bing Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
monica_geller Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
chandler_bing Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
monica_geller Wait! What about Joey?
monica_geller Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
phoebe_buffay Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
monica_geller Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
chandler_bing I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
monica_geller No, she's out shopping.
dr_ross_geller Damn!
chandler_bing What's going on?
dr_ross_geller I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
phoebe_buffay Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
dr_ross_geller Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
monica_geller Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
dr_ross_geller I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
joey_tribbiani Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean
rachel_green Hi, guys!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
chandler_bing Uh, hey!
rachel_green What's going on?
chandler_bing We're flipping Monica's mattress.
joey_tribbiani So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
phoebe_buffay Yeah that's better than my way.
rachel_green Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
chandler_bing Aww, man!
rachel_green Oh look! A letter from my mom.
dr_ross_geller So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
rachel_green Oh yeah! I know.
phoebe_buffay Can you hear anything?
chandler_bing Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
monica_geller Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
monica_geller Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
phoebe_buffay Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
chandler_bing Condoms?
joey_tribbiani You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
chandler_bing And condoms are the way to do that?
dr_ross_geller Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily
rachel_green Oh my God! My dog died!
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
dr_ross_geller Le Poo's still alive?!
rachel_green Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
monica_geller Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
rachel_green It's Le Poo.
phoebe_buffay I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
chandler_bing I can't believe it! We're here!
monica_geller Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
chandler_bing Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
monica_geller Come here. Okay, be right back.
chandler_bing Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
monica_geller We're switching rooms.
chandler_bing Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
monica_geller No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
chandler_bing Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
dr_ross_geller Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
rachel_green Oh yeah!
dr_ross_geller Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller You're nose is bleeding!
rachel_green Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
dr_ross_geller Umm
rachel_green Sorry. Sorry.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
rachel_green Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
the_hotel_clerk I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
chandler_bing Okay, great.
the_hotel_clerk They say he's only got half a tank left.
chandler_bing Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
monica_geller We're switching rooms again.
chandler_bing What? Why?
monica_geller This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
the_hotel_clerk Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
monica_geller Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
chandler_bing Uh-huh.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing Yeah.
monica_geller Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
chandler_bing I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
monica_geller Okay, this one I like!
chandler_bing Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
monica_geller Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
chandler_bing Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
monica_geller Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
chandler_bing Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
monica_geller I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
chandler_bing Do not speak ill of the dead.
monica_geller We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
chandler_bing I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
monica_geller What did you say?
chandler_bing I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
rachel_green Okay, what's up?
dr_ross_geller Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
rachel_green Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
dr_ross_geller And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
rachel_green Yeah?
dr_ross_geller ...is for me not to see you anymore.
rachel_green That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
dr_ross_geller It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
rachel_green Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
dr_ross_geller You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
rachel_green Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?
rachel_green Storming out!
dr_ross_geller Rachel, this is your apartment.
rachel_green Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
chandler_bing Damn Rollos!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you're back!
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani How was your conference?
chandler_bing It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
joey_tribbiani Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
chandler_bing Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
monica_geller Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you're back too!
monica_geller Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
joey_tribbiani Hey, how was your chef thing?
monica_geller Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
chandler_bing Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing Monica.
monica_geller Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
chandler_bing Okay, fine, $300.
monica_geller 300 dollars?!
chandler_bing Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
monica_geller Urghh!!
joey_tribbiani What are you guys woofing about?
monica_geller Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
joey_tribbiani Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
dr_ross_geller You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
joey_tribbiani You want my advice?
dr_ross_geller Yes! Please!
joey_tribbiani You're not gonna like it.
dr_ross_geller That's okay.
joey_tribbiani You got married to fast.
dr_ross_geller That's not advice!
joey_tribbiani I told ya.
dr_ross_geller I'm going to the bathroom.
joey_tribbiani Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
chandler_bing@phoebe_buffay Yeah, me either.
monica_geller Maybe I could do it.
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hi, Rach.
chandler_bing Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
joey_tribbiani I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
rachel_green That's not Ross!
phoebe_buffay Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
chandler_bing Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
rachel_green Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
joey_tribbiani Hey, you're not Kip!
rachel_green Do you even know who Kip is?
joey_tribbiani Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
chandler_bing Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
joey_tribbiani Oh, that poor bastard.
rachel_green See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
monica_geller You're not gonna be phased out!
rachel_green Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
phoebe_buffay Ehh!!
rachel_green Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
chandler_bing Yes that was mine.
joey_tribbiani 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
chandler_bing Yes that would have made more sense.
joey_tribbiani Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
rachel_green Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
phoebe_buffay Come where?
rachel_green Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
phoebe_buffay Okay, but try and get Joey too.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
phoebe_buffay Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
dr_ross_geller I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
rachel_green Oh, Ross
dr_ross_geller No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
rachel_green No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
dr_ross_geller Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
rachel_green Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this is happening.
rachel_green I know.
dr_ross_geller I am so sorry.
rachel_green I know that too.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hi.
chandler_bing I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
monica_geller Yeah, it did.
chandler_bing So, I guess this is over.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
monica_geller Why, exactly?
chandler_bing Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
monica_geller Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
chandler_bing So, this isn't over?
monica_geller You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
chandler_bing Really? Okay. Great!
monica_geller Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
chandler_bing We're in a relationship?
monica_geller I'm afraid so.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
monica_geller Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
monica_geller Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
rachel_green Yeah, it's in there.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
chandler_bing Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
joey_tribbiani Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
joey_tribbiani Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
chandler_bing Yes. Yes.
joey_tribbiani You?! And-and you?!
monica_geller Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
joey_tribbiani How?! When?!
chandler_bing It happened in London.
joey_tribbiani IN LONDON!!!
chandler_bing The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
joey_tribbiani But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
chandler_bing No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
monica_geller Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
joey_tribbiani All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but
monica_geller I know, it's great!
joey_tribbiani Aww, I don't want to see that!
phoebe_buffay We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
phoebe_buffay The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
monica_geller Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
phoebe_buffay Count for what?
monica_geller Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
joey_tribbiani I guess I'm done.
chandler_bing Fun's over!
monica_geller Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
rachel_green Uh-huh!
joey_tribbiani I think I'm gonna take-off.
monica_geller Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
