joey_tribbiani Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
monica_geller 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
rachel_green Ok honey, you really need a job.
dr_ross_geller Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
monica_geller Really.
phoebe_buffay Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
dr_ross_geller On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
phoebe_buffay No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
everyone#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode21 Ahh.
phoebe_buffay And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
monica_geller His indian name?
phoebe_buffay No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
dr_ross_geller Freakish.
monica_geller Wow.
joey_tribbiani Freaky.
monica_geller Weird, weird.
rachel_green Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
phoebe_buffay Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
monica_geller Why?

chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
dr_ross_geller Do you say this stuff to girls?
carl Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
arthur And look where they're sitting.
dr_ross_geller You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
carl Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
arthur Yeah.
carl This couch belongs to us.
chandler_bing Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
carl You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
dr_ross_geller Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
gunther Fellas, these guys were here first.
carl Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
arthur Sorry.
gunther There you go.
dr_ross_geller Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
arthur He told on us?
carl You told on us?
dr_ross_geller Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
chandler_bing Don't play with his things.
dr_ross_geller I know.
carl Alright, let's take this outside.
dr_ross_geller Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
carl The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
chandler_bing You had to ask.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
arthur Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
chandler_bing I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
joey_tribbiani Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I don't know.
rachel_green What's the matter?
phoebe_buffay I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
rachel_green Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
phoebe_buffay Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
phoebe_buffay What was that?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
monica_geller I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and
rachel_green Time is money my friend?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
monica_geller Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
joey_tribbiani Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
rachel_green How did you make $17.
monica_geller Well, my financially challenged friends,
joey_tribbiani How come those?
monica_geller Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
rachel_green What happened to uh, MEG.?
monica_geller MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
joey_tribbiani That is so not my motto.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
rachel_green Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
phoebe_buffay Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Good.
rachel_green Oh, thank God.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
rachel_green Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
phoebe_buffay I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone.
joey_tribbiani Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
phoebe_buffay Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
rachel_green She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
joey_tribbiani It's a woman.
phoebe_buffay So talk to her.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
rachel_green Why the voice.
joey_tribbiani Hard to say.
chandler_bing Your cappucino sir.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
chandler_bing Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
dr_ross_geller Absolutely.
dr_ross_geller How come it's not mixing with the water?
chandler_bing Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
joey_tribbiani Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
chandler_bing Ok.
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing No?
dr_ross_geller No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
chandler_bing Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
joey_tribbiani Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, sure.
joey_tribbiani By someone besides Monica?
dr_ross_geller No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
chandler_bing Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
monica_geller I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
rachel_green For what?
monica_geller I've gotta get back in the game.
rachel_green Why, when did you get out of the game?
monica_geller I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
rachel_green Oh no.
monica_geller Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
rachel_green Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
monica_geller Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
rachel_green I, I don't have it.
monica_geller But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
rachel_green Nobody does honey.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
mrs_buffay Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
phoebe_buffay It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
mrs_buffay What are these, stitches?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
mrs_buffay Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
phoebe_buffay Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
mrs_buffay How do you know Frank?
phoebe_buffay Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
mrs_buffay Yeah. Frank.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah. What?
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
mrs_buffay He went out for groceries.
phoebe_buffay Ok so will he be back soon?
mrs_buffay Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
phoebe_buffay Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
frank_buffay_jr Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
phoebe_buffay Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
frank_buffay_jr Heavy.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
frank_buffay_jr No but he didn't really talk about anything.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
frank_buffay_jr Except stilts.
phoebe_buffay Stilts?
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
phoebe_buffay Wow.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah.
phoebe_buffay I don't know what to do with that.
frank_buffay_jr Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
frank_buffay_jr This is huge, you can buy me beer.
phoebe_buffay I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
frank_buffay_jr I gotta friend named Mark.
phoebe_buffay That'll work too.
frank_buffay_jr Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, that'd be ok.
frank_buffay_jr Alright.
phoebe_buffay Ok, I'm in the book.
frank_buffay_jr Ok, yeah.
phoebe_buffay Alright. So um, stilts huh?
frank_buffay_jr Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
phoebe_buffay Ok.
dr_ross_geller Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
chandler_bing Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
chandler_bing Ah, there we go.
dr_ross_geller I think we proved our point.
chandler_bing You burn your mouth?

chandler_bing Ok.
carl Or your keys.
chandler_bing Ok.
arthur Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
dr_ross_geller Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

dr_ross_geller Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
arthur Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
carl Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
arthur Oh really, you guys tryin' again?

chandler_bing Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
