dr_ross_geller She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
monica_geller I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
joey_tribbiani Do we have to know about that?
monica_geller Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
chandler_bing Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
dr_ross_geller God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
rachel_green Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
rachel_green What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
chandler_bing You have to pick your moments.
phoebe_buffay Did I miss it, did I miss it?
dr_ross_geller She's not even here yet.
monica_geller What's with the guitar?
phoebe_buffay I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
dr_ross_geller Where the hell have you been?
susan_bunch We stopped at the gift shop.
carol_willick I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
dr_ross_geller Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
chandler_bing I used to have that bumper sticker.
chandler_bing You see what I mean.
dr_ross_geller Stopped for a Chunky.
carol_willick Let it go, Ross.
susan_bunch I got an extra one. You want this?
dr_ross_geller No.
dr_franzblau Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
dr_ross_geller Dr. Franzblau, hi.
dr_franzblau So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
carol_willick Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
susan_bunch They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
dr_ross_geller 59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
susan_bunch Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
carol_willick Am I allowed to drink anything?
dr_franzblau Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
dr_ross_geller I'll get it.
susan_bunch No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
dr_ross_geller I got it-I'm getting it!
rachel_green Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
carol_willick Thanks.
rachel_green And if you need anything else, I--do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
dr_franzblau It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
rachel_green Oh, that's funny!
monica_geller I want a baby.
chandler_bing Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
monica_geller Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
chandler_bing Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
joey_tribbiani Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
lydia Knick fan?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah.
lydia Oh, boy, do they suck.
joey_tribbiani Hey, listen, lady.......whoa.
lydia Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? And who do you like?
lydia The Celtics.
joey_tribbiani The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
lydia Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
joey_tribbiani Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
lydia There is no father.
joey_tribbiani Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
lydia Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
joey_tribbiani Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
lydia Ok.
phoebe_buffay Thanks, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
phoebe_buffay Ok.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
monica_geller No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
chandler_bing You'll get one.
monica_geller Oh yeah? When?
chandler_bing All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
monica_geller Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler_bing Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
monica_geller Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler_bing No, no, no.
monica_geller What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
chandler_bing Uh, uh.
monica_geller Well?
chandler_bing Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
monica_geller Did you go home and change?
rachel_green Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
monica_geller No, I haven't seen him.
rachel_green Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
chandler_bing Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
rachel_green Yeah, why?
chandler_bing No reason.
lydia Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
joey_tribbiani Tribbiani.
lydia Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
joey_tribbiani Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
lydia She's not much of a phone person.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
lydia Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
joey_tribbiani Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
lydia Maybe you should.
joey_tribbiani Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
joey_tribbiani You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
lydia Oh, that is so not true.
joey_tribbiani Oh, it is.
lydia It isn't.
joey_tribbiani It is.
lydia Isn't!
dr_ross_geller Breathe.
susan_bunch Breathe.
dr_ross_geller Breathe.
susan_bunch Breathe.
dr_ross_geller Breathe.
susan_bunch Breathe.
carol_willick You're gonna kill me!
dr_ross_geller 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
carol_willick Count faster.
susan_bunch It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
dr_ross_geller Who the hell is Jordie?
susan_bunch Your son.
dr_ross_geller No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
carol_willick Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
dr_ross_geller What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
carol_willick Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
dr_ross_geller I got it.
susan_bunch I got it.
dr_ross_geller I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
susan_bunch No, you don't.
carol_willick All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
dr_ross_geller Why?
susan_bunch He started it!
dr_ross_geller No, you started it.
susan_bunch You did!
carol_willick I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
dr_ross_geller But...
carol_willick Now go!
dr_ross_geller Thanks a lot.
susan_bunch See what you did.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, listen...
carol_willick Out!
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 Breathe, breathe, breathe...
lydia Oh, no.
joey_tribbiani Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
joey_tribbiani Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 Breathe, breathe, breathe.
dr_ross_geller Please. This is so your fault.
susan_bunch How, how is this my fault?
dr_ross_geller Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
susan_bunch Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
dr_ross_geller You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
susan_bunch You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm threatened by you?
susan_bunch Yes.
phoebe_buffay Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, Susan.
phoebe_buffay Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
phoebe_buffay Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
all@ Help!
dr_ross_geller I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
carol_willick Are they here yet?
rachel_green No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
carol_willick Ok.
rachel_green Ok?
carol_willick Ok.
rachel_green Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
dr_franzblau It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
joey_tribbiani Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's- I was just-yeah, right. Push! Push!
susan_bunch What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
dr_ross_geller Help! Help!
phoebe_buffay They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
dr_ross_geller@susan_bunch Help!
monica_geller Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
chandler_bing Where have you been?
joey_tribbiani Oh, just had a baby.
chandler_bing Mazel tov!
dr_franzblau I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
rachel_green No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
dr_franzblau No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
rachel_green Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
dr_franzblau No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_franzblau I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
rachel_green I'm a waitress.
dr_franzblau Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
rachel_green Yeah. Gotcha.
dr_franzblau I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
rachel_green Ok. That's fine.
lydia So how did you know I was even here?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 Your mom called me. So is this her?
lydia No, this is a loaner.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
lydia I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
lydia Yeah, they're not so bad.
dr_ross_geller Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
susan_bunch The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
dr_ross_geller No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
susan_bunch You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
dr_ross_geller Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
phoebe_buffay This is so great.
dr_ross_geller You wanna explain that?
phoebe_buffay I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
carol_willick Where are they?
monica_geller I'm sure they'll be here soon.
rachel_green Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
joey_tribbiani Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
chandler_bing You are really frightening me.
chandler_bing Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
dr_franzblau All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 All right, honey, time to start pushing.
carol_willick But they're not here yet!
dr_franzblau I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
carol_willick Oh, god.
dr_ross_geller Ok, got the vent open.
phoebe_buffay Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
dr_ross_geller Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
susan_bunch What do you see?
phoebe_buffay Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
dr_ross_geller Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
janitor#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 Wait! You forgot your legs!
all@ Push, push!
dr_ross_geller We're here!
carol_willick Where have you been?
dr_ross_geller Long story, honey.
dr_franzblau All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need- Excuse me, could I have this?
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
all@ Good luck!
chandler_bing Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
nurse#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode23 Out!
dr_franzblau All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
dr_ross_geller Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
carol_willick Not.... helping!
dr_franzblau You're doing great, you're doing fine.
dr_ross_geller Hello! Oh, sorry.
susan_bunch What do you see? What do you see?
dr_ross_geller We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
susan_bunch Oh, look at that.
carol_willick What does he look like?
dr_ross_geller Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
carol_willick Really?
phoebe_buffay You guys, he's beautiful!
dr_ross_geller Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
susan_bunch No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
dr_ross_geller How 'bout Ben?
susan_bunch I like Ben.
carol_willick Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
dr_ross_geller We uh, we just cooked it up.
susan_bunch That's what we were off doing.
monica_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller Can we come in?
dr_ross_geller I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
phoebe_buffay Susan, he looks just like you.
susan_bunch Thanks.
rachel_green Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
chandler_bing I know, I still am one of these.
monica_geller Ross, can I?
dr_ross_geller The head, the head. You gotta...
monica_geller Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
dr_ross_geller Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
chandler_bing And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
monica_geller He is so amazing.
rachel_green Oh, I know. Look at him.
joey_tribbiani Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
joey_tribbiani He doesn't do much, does he?
dr_ross_geller No, this is pretty much it.
rachel_green You guys wanna get some coffee?
all@ Yeah.
dr_ross_geller All right, I'll see you guys later.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
