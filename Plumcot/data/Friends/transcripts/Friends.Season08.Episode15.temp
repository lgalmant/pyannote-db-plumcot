phoebe Oh! Hey, Rach!
rachel Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
phoebe Oh, you, too.
joey Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
rachel It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
phoebe Okay.
joey Bye.
joey There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
phoebe Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
joey Thanks. But maybe later.
phoebe Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
gunther You want anything?
joey You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
gunther We have red bagels.
joey Oh, okay.
phoebe So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
ross Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
phoebe Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
ross Uh, I'm going to take off.
phoebe All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
ross What is it?
phoebe It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
ross All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
phoebe Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
monica Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
phoebe Oh, Monica, grow up!
ross Hey, what's behind your back?
monica Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
ross You don't want my opinion?
monica Not really.
ross Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
monica All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
ross The red one.
phoebe Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
joey No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
phoebe He-hee!
joey Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
phoebe This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
joey Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
chandler Happy Valentine's!
monica Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
chandler 'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
man_on_tv Yeah, just relax.
chandler I love you, St. Valentine.
chandler Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
man_on_tv Now, push!
woman_on_tv Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
chandler Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
woman_on_tv Ohhh! Make it stop!
chandler I am trying!
joey Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!
joey Did I just throw this?
rachel Hi.
joey Hi.
rachel I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
joey Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
rachel Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.
joey C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be.
monica So what do you think?
monica I've still got it!
chandler Why did you get me this?
monica What is it?
chandler It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating
monica Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?
chandler I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
monica Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
chandler Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
monica Honey, what's going on?
chandler Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
monica Mm-hmm.
chandler How long it took to go back in the water?
monica Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!
chandler You don't know. You didn't see it.
monica Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.
chandler Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
monica Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
chandler See, honey, there's-
monica Don't touch me!
mona Hi!
ross Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
mona Good.
ross Yeah?
mona I brought you back a present.
ross Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
mona I think it's interesting.
ross I do too! I missed you!
mona I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
ross Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
mona How exciting!
ross Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
mona Oh no.
ross Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
mona Yeah right!
ross What?
mona Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!'
ross Huh...uh-huh.
mona Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!
mona So, what'd you tell him?
ross Just a second!
phoebe How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
ross I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
phoebe Taffy, really? I've never had any.
ross Ever?!
phoebe Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
ross Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
phoebe If I haven't said it before: she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?
joey So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey.
phoebe Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?
joey No.
phoebe Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
joey Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
phoebe He's miserable! What happened to him?
joey Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
phoebe What stuff?
joey Rachel stuff.
phoebe Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
joey He's breathing!
phoebe Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
joey No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
ross Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
rachel Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
ross Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
rachel Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
rachel Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
ross Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
mona Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise!
ross Ayyyayyyy!
rachel Oh, hey, Mona!
mona Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! What's she doing here?
ross I have no idea!
rachel I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
mona Seriously, what is she doing?
ross Uh...lately, she just likes hanging out here.
mona Why?
ross I think she's lonely.
mona Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!
ross I know.
mona Can't we just ask her to go?
ross No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
rachel I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
mona Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
ross Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
rachel You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
ross And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
mona You got another ex-wife back there?
ross Please start drinking!
rachel I'm just going to grab the phone.
mona Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, but, um... what are you doing?
rachel Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
mona No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
rachel But, but, Mona, I live here.
ross Happy Valentine's Day!..Or something to remember me by.
monica How long has it been this time?
chandler 90 seconds.
monica That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
chandler You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
monica Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
chandler I can do that.
monica Okay.
chandler Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
monica Oh, thank God!
chandler Oh, I know!
monica Come in!
rachel Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
monica Oh, my God.
chandler Poor Ross.
chandler Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
monica Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
chandler Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don't watch it.
rachel Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
chandler Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
rachel Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
monica No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
rachel C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
monica She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.
chandler This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
rachel Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
chandler Why have I seen this thing three times?!
monica It's...still beautiful.
rachel Uh! It's horrible!
monica I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!
rachel Oh, my God!
chandler Wait, you guys, look!
rachel What? Did her ass explode?!
chandler No, the baby's out! Look, look!
monica Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
chandler And look how happy the mom is now!
monica Oh...Rach!
rachel Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
ross Hey, hey, man!
joey Hey, what's up?
ross Uh...Mona just dumped me.
joey Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
ross Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
joey Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
ross Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
joey Sort of.
ross Really?!
joey You don't have to seem so happy about it.
ross Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
joey Oh, I...I d-
ross Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
ross Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
joey Forget about it. It's no big deal.
ross C'mon! Joey! What is it?
joey It's nothing.
ross Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
joey Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
ross She's not a Tribbiani?
joey No!
ross I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
joey Yes.
ross Well, uh, does she like you?
joey Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
ross Why not?
joey Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
ross So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?
joey No. I don't think so.
ross Okay. Um... is he a good guy?
joey Yeah, he's the best.
ross Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
joey Oh, I don't know.
ross Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
joey I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
ross Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
gunther Here's your warm milk.
ross I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
joey Oh, yeah.
ross Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
joey It's Rachel.
rachel You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
woman_on_tv I came to the big city to become a star! I'll do...anything to make that happen!
man_on_tv Anything?
rachel Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
