phoebe Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
rachel I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
ross Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
rachel Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
chandler And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
ross Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
all Good idea! Yes!
ross It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
joey Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
chandler Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
ross Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
rachel Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
phoebe It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
ross Ohh.
rachel Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
phoebe Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
rachel What?!
phoebe Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
rachel Oh my God!
phoebe CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
rachel OH MY GOD!!!
phoebe OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
rachel Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
phoebe NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
rachel I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
phoebe YOU KNOW?!!!
rachel Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
ross What's going on?
phoebe_and_rachel Ohhh!!!
rachel HI!! Hi!
ross What?! What?!
rachel Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
ross Actually, it looks really good.
phoebe Get in here!!!
phoebe You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
rachel Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
phoebe Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
joey Hey guys!
rachel Joey! Come here! Come here!
joey What? What?
rachel Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
joey You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
rachel No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
phoebe Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
joey Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
phoebe Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
rachel Wh-what do you mean?
phoebe Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
rachel Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
joey No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
rachel Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
joey I can't take any
phoebe No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
joey Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
rachel You don't have any secrets!
joey Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
rachel So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
joey Ugh.
phoebe Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
rachel Okay.
phoebe And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
chandler Hello children!
all Hey!
phoebe Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
chandler Hey.
phoebe Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
chandler Really?
phoebe Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
chandler Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
phoebe Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
chandler Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
phoebe Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
chandler What's going on?
phoebe I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
monica You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
chandler Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
monica Okay, now you're even cuter!!
chandler Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
monica What?
chandler The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
monica What are you talking about?
chandler I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
monica That's not possible!
chandler Ow!
monica I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
chandler Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
monica I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
chandler No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
monica This bicep?
chandler Well it's not flexed right now!
rachel Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
monica Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
rachel Oh.
monica Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
chandler Sure, I'll do it with ya.
monica Okay.
rachel Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
monica I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
phoebe I have quarters!
ross Hey!
rachel Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
ross Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
rachel Oh.
ross No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
monica Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
ross No.
chandler That new mountain bike?
ross No.
monica Well what did you send?
ross A basket of mini-muffins.
phoebe But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
ross The small one.
rachel What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
ross Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
chandler Your work makes me sad.
ross Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
rachel All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
monica Bye!
all Bye!
phoebe Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
chandler Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
monica Actually, I did!
chandler Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
monica Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
chandler Are you serious?
monica Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
chandler Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
chandler Joey!
joey Yeah?
chandler Phoebe knows about us!
joey Well I didn't tell them!
monica Them?! Who's them?
joey Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
monica Joey!
joey And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
chandler Oh man!
joey I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
monica Unless
joey No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
monica Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
chandler Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
ross Noooo.
rachel Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
phoebe Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
ross Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
rachel Y'know what you should do?
ross Huh?
rachel You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
joey I'm listening.
rachel See?
ross That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
phoebe He broke that.
ross Well, he had gravity boots.
rachel Yeah, he broke those too.
joey So he likes to break stuff.
ross Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
phoebe I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
joey Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
ross Right.
rachel Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
phoebe Oh? Hello you.
chandler Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
phoebe Eh?
chandler Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
phoebe Really?
chandler Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
phoebe I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
rachel Are you kidding?!
phoebe No!
rachel I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
joey No.
rachel Joey!
joey They know you know.
rachel Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
phoebe God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
joey I couldn't even if I wanted too.
ross Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
monica Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
chandler Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
monica Oh yeah!
phoebe All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.

phoebe Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!

phoebe Really?
chandler Oh, do you not want to?
phoebe No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
chandler Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
chandler Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
monica She's bluffing!
chandler Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
phoebe He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
joey Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
rachel Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
joey Ooh!
rachel Okay!
joey I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
phoebe Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
joey It's not my first time.

chandler Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
