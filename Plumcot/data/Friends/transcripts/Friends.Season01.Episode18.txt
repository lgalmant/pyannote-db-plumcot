dr_ross_geller Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.

chandler_bing Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
rachel_green Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'
dr_ross_geller Rach, did you proofread these?
rachel_green Uh... yeah, why?
dr_ross_geller Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.

chandler_bing You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
dr_ross_geller I don't know.
chandler_bing Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
dr_ross_geller No, it's not just that. It's just-I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
chandler_bing ..little playthings with yarn?
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing Could you want her more?
dr_ross_geller Who?
chandler_bing Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
dr_ross_geller Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
rachel_green Hi! How are you?
dr_ross_geller We're fine, we're fine.
rachel_green OK.
joey_tribbiani Shut up!
chandler_bing We're not-we're not saying anything.
phoebe_buffay What?
dr_ross_geller Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
joey_tribbiani Thank you.
chandler_bing We were playing poker, alright...
joey_tribbiani There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
dr_ross_geller Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
chandler_bing And then he did.
rachel_green Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
dr_ross_geller No, women are welcome to play.
phoebe_buffay Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
chandler_bing There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
girls#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode18 Oh, yeah, right.
monica_geller Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
rachel_green Really.
monica_geller I mean, that's a typical guy response.
dr_ross_geller Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
girls#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode18 No.
rachel_green But you could teach us.
guys#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode18 No.
chandler_bing OK, so now we draw cards.
monica_geller So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
rachel_green Oh, good for you!
phoebe_buffay Congratulations!
chandler_bing OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
phoebe_buffay OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
dr_ross_geller No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't-you can't do...
rachel_green Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
dr_ross_geller No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
rachel_green Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you're...
monica_geller Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green OOooooo!
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
chandler_bing OK, so at this point, the dealer...
monica_geller Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
dr_ross_geller Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
phoebe_buffay But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
chandler_bing OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
monica_geller Dammit, dammit, dammit!
phoebe_buffay : Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
joey_tribbiani About what?
phoebe_buffay About how good your cards were.
joey_tribbiani Heh... I was bluffing.
phoebe_buffay A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
rachel_green OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
guys#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode18 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
chandler_bing Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
rachel_green Settle what?
chandler_bing The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
dr_ross_geller The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
rachel_green Oh. Right.
joey_tribbiani You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
monica_geller Hell no, we'll pay!
phoebe_buffay OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
monica_geller And you know what? We want a rematch.
dr_ross_geller Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
rachel_green : So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
dr_ross_geller ..Yeah.
chandler_bing Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
dr_ross_geller Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
joey_tribbiani ..Yeah?
dr_ross_geller I'm not a nice guy.
dr_ross_geller Alright boys, let's eat.
chandler_bing Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
dr_ross_geller You still on that?
chandler_bing Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
dr_ross_geller You are way off, pal.
joey_tribbiani No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
dr_ross_geller Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time-not any more. I just-I...
dr_ross_geller Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
dr_ross_geller You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK-if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
rachel_green Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
monica_geller Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
phoebe_buffay Ha. Ha, ha.
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
monica_geller Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
rachel_green Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
monica_geller That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
rachel_green Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
monica_geller You're kidding! Where? Where?
rachel_green : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
monica_geller Oh, Rachel!
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
monica_geller Well, what's the job?
rachel_green Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
monica_geller OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
aunt_iris Is Tony Randall dead?
rachel_green No.
monica_geller I don't think so.
rachel_green Why?
aunt_iris Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
monica_geller What?
rachel_green Oh my God!
monica_geller Really?
aunt_iris No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
phoebe_buffay Thank y...
aunt_iris Girls, sit down.
monica_geller Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
aunt_iris Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
phoebe_buffay Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
dr_ross_geller Alright.
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
chandler_bing Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
rachel_green Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and-oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
all@ That's great! That's wonderful!
rachel_green Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
monica_geller OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
joey_tribbiani Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
chandler_bing Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
monica_geller Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Yes, we should. I think we should.
dr_ross_geller Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
rachel_green No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
dr_ross_geller Alright.
rachel_green Alright...
dr_ross_geller So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
joey_tribbiani But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
phoebe_buffay Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
joey_tribbiani What?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
chandler_bing That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
dr_ross_geller Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
rachel_green Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
monica_geller You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
rachel_green Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
dr_ross_geller So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
rachel_green Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
monica_geller OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
monica_geller Excuse me, where are you going?
dr_ross_geller Uh... to the bathroom.
monica_geller Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
dr_ross_geller I want to go to the bathroom.
joey_tribbiani Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
rachel_green Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
