joey Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
chandler Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
joey Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
chandler I could fall asleep at a play.
phoebe What is it?
joey It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me
monica It sounds interesting!
ross Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
phoebe I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
joey You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
ross What? How come that you don't have to go!
joey I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
chandler Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
rachel Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
joey Hey, here you go.
rachel Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
monica Yeah.
rachel Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
monica No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
rachel No reason.
monica No, no, Rachel?
rachel Yeah
monica Who do you wanna fool around with?
rachel Nobody, forget it!
rachel Maybe.
monica You can't!
rachel Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
monica In the hall.
monica You wanna fool around with Joey?
rachel Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
monica Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
rachel Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
monica Who, who are they?
rachel I know them from work.
monica Both of them?
rachel No, one of them...
monica Which one?
rachel I don't know, what were the names I just said?
monica Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
rachel All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
monica What the hell are you cooking!
ross Hey!
monica Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
chandler Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
ross There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
monica What's so bad about that?
ross It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
ross These aren't suede.
charlie Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
gunther No.
ross Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
charlie Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
ross Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
charlie It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
ross Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
monica Is he gonna introduce us?
chandler No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
charlie And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
ross Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
monica Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
ross We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
charlie Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
ross I don't think so.
charlie I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
ross Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?
charlie You don't think we should wait for him?
ross You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
professor_spafford Professor Geller?
ross Oh, damn it!
jane Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
joey Hey!
rachel Hey!
joey What's happenin'?
rachel Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
joey Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
rachel Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
message "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
joey Stupid Jane Rogers!!
rachel You are having a party tonight??
joey Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
rachel And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
joey I do it every year.
rachel You do that every year??
joey I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
rachel Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
joey Yeah...
rachel And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
joey Yeah...
rachel OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
joey I can't believe you guys went for that one!
rachel Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
joey You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
rachel Well, then so you just invite me...!
joey Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
rachel Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
joey Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
rachel OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system!
professor_spafford And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
ross So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
professor_spafford And that's not all I'm allergic to.
ross Oh, it's not over!
professor_spafford I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
ross So basically all nuts?
professor_spafford Interestingly... no.
charlie Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
professor_spafford If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.
charlie Oh my God!!
ross I've lost the will to live.
charlie Let's ditch him!
ross What?
charlie Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
ross Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
charlie Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!
ross Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
phoebe Hi!
ross Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
phoebe Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
charlie Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
phoebe Ah, ah.
charlie Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
ross Ranion's theory of species variegation?
phoebe Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
monica So, did you two have fun?
ross Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
monica And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
rachel Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
ross Really? Wh-what's wrong?
rachel I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
charlie Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
rachel ... Ok, who is this?
ross I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
rachel Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
monica Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
rachel Sure! Oh...
monica You're not sick!
rachel What? Yes, I am!
monica Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??
rachel When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
monica You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
rachel Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
monica Ok, what is this?
rachel Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
monica WHAT?
ross Wh-what's going on?
monica Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
rachel And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
charlie I thought you came to say you were sick.
rachel Ok professor or detective?
phoebe Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
rachel Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
phoebe And that horrible museum tour!
ross No, I arranged that...
joey Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
phoebe We know about your party Joey.
joey What party?
monica The game's over! Take off your robe!
joey Ok... I mean...

kyle_lowder Hi.
monica I love you!
joey Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
monica Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
phoebe Hey!
monica Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
phoebe Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
monica Oh my God! Chandler!
chandler Where the hell is everybody?
bitter_lady Why don't you like me?! Chapter One
monica Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too
rachel Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
monica Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
matthew_ashford It was nice to meet you Rachel.
rachel Nice to meet you.
matthew_ashford Call me.
rachel Ok
monica We will!!
monica Look at you with all the guys!
rachel Yeah!
monica I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
rachel Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
monica Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy!
ross So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
charlie Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
ross Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
charlie Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
ross You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
charlie Yeah...
ross ... And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
charlie Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
ross Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
charlie Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
ross Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
charlie Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
ross Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
charlie A guy who won two.
ross Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
charlie Yeah... for three years.
ross Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
charlie ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
ross Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
charlie No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
ross Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
phoebe Hey Ross!
rache How is it going with Charlie?
ross Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
phoebe Oh, What's the matter?
ross She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
rachel I always loved that!!
ross Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
phoebe Worse?
ross Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... "Can we walk"? Oh, you... you like that?
phoebe No.
ross What?
rachel Come on! I think this is funny!
bitter_lady Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
chandler oh yes, God yes!!
bitter_lady Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7
chandler I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
joey Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
ross Nice to meet you.
dirk Hey! So what show are you on?
ross Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
joey It's a science.
dirk Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
joey Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
ross Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
dirk Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
ross I'd lead with that.
monica That's it, just sign right on the bra .
joey Monica!
monica Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
joey What have you got there?
ross Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
joey Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
rachel I think I am.
joey Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
joey Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
rachel Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
joey Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
rachel Joey, you're so sweet.
joey That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
rachel Who ?
joey Me.
rachel What? Really?
joey Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
rachel Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
joey Gotcha.
rachel Oh, Very funny... Joey.
chandler So, how did you enjoy the play?
monica Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
chandler Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
monica You really liked it?
chandler Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16
monica Oh really!
chandler Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
monica No!
chandler Did somebody sign your bra?
monica So I got it when I was 13...
phoebe Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
ross It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
phoebe Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
ross Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
phoebe You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
ross And sexy.
phoebe Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
ross Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
phoebe Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
ross Stop going through my stuff !
rachel Hey!
monica Hey!
rachel I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind
monica No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
rachel Please, what about you and Chandler?
monica That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
rachel Well hello !
monica What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
rachel I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
monica Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
rachel I'm gonna do it.
monica And I can't stop you.
rachel No.
ross Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
ross I'm smarter than him!
phoebe Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
chandler Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
monica Oh, you're so wonderful.
bitter_woman Why don't you like me! Chapter one
chandler Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
