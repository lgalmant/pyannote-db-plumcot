joey There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
ross So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?
joey Yeah, he's the best.
ross Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
joey Oh, I don't know.
ross Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
joey I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
ross Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
joey It's Rachel.
ross Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
joey Yes.
ross Um, you...you like Rachel?
joey Yes. I like Rachel.
ross Rachel?!
joey Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
ross But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
joey Yeah, but it's not a big deal.
ross It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?
joey I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
ross Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?
joey Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
ross Y'know what? I-I gotta go.
joey Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't
ross I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
gunther Rachel?!!
rachel Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
chandler Oh! She's growing inside you.
rachel Whoa!!
chandler Oh!
rachel Wow that was a big one.
chandler I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
phoebe Oh hey you guys!
chandler Oh hey!
rachel Hi!
phoebe Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
rachel Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.
phoebe Uh-huh, and you?
chandler No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
phoebe Okay, good.
chandler Why?
phoebe Well last night, I met Monica's.
chandler What?
phoebe Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
chandler Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?
rachel Well, what's he like?!
phoebe Well he's tall.
rachel Uh-huh.
phoebe He has brown hair.
rachel Of course, of course.
chandler A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
phoebe He works with food!
rachel Oh sure. Older?
phoebe Obviously, and he's British.
rachel Oh, I was just gonna ask!
phoebe Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
rachel Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
chandler Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
phoebe Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
chandler You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
phoebe Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
monica Hey.
ross Hey.
monica I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
ross Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
monica All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
ross Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.
monica Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
ross Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
monica Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
ross He's not?
monica No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
ross Why?
monica He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
ross Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
monica Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
ross Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.
monica All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
phoebe Oh! Hi!
monica Hi!
phoebe Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
don Oh, hello. Hello.
phoebe Soul mate.
chandler What?
phoebe Soul mate.
monica So, what have you guys been doing?
don Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
monica I know! What is this, 1985?!
don That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
monica Not really.
chandler What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
monica So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
don Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
monica Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
don You're kidding me!
monica No!
don Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
monica Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
chandler What are you doing?!
phoebe Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So
chandler I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
phoebe They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
monica Phoebe, good work.
phoebe Yeah?
monica Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him.
phoebe Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
joey Hey.
ross Hey.
joey Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
ross No, I don't want to hit you.
joey Oh what then? Kick me?
ross No.
joey Bite me?
ross No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
joey Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
ross Uh...yeah sure.
joey Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't
ross Okay.
joey Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
ross Thank you.
joey Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so
ross What?! You're in love with her.
joey Yeah, I thought you knew that.
ross Umm, no.
joey Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
ross I think you need to tell her how you feel.
joey Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
ross No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
joey But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But
ross If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
joey Are you sure?
ross Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So
joey Hey thanks.
ross So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
joey Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
ross I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
joey I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!
ross Yeah, tell me about it.
don ...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
chandler Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
don Excuse me?
chandler Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
don Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
monica Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
don And you're still married to him?
monica You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
don Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
chandler Is it made of cheese?
don No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
monica I'd move in tomorrow!
chandler Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
phoebe I'm so sorry.
chandler What do we do?
phoebe I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
joey Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident.
rachel Joey? What's up?
joey I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
rachel Okay what's up?
joey Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
rachel Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
joey Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
rachel Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
joey Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!
monica I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
chandler Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
monica Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
chandler Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
monica Jeez! What is with you?
chandler I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
monica All right, what's going on?
chandler Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
monica Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
chandler No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
monica I don't believe in soul mates either.
chandler You don't?
monica No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
chandler So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
monica No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
chandler I love you.
monica I know.
chandler Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers No? Really? They taste so good.
rachel ...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. Are you okay?
joey What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?
rachel No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
joey I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
rachel Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
joey Yeah. Sure.
rachel Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
joey Uh... How long have we known each other?
rachel Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
joey Uh-huh, long time.
rachel Yeah.
joey But over the past few weeks
waiter Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight
joey Actually uh, could you give us a second?
waiter Sure. Sure. Second's up! Not...that kind of table.
rachel So you were saying?
joey I'm not quite sure.
rachel Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.

rachel Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I
joey But.

joey Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go.
rachel No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
joey Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!
rachel Can I?
joey Sure!
rachel Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose
joey Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
rachel I'm so sorry.
joey Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
rachel Yeah, that was a real good one.
waiter_no_2 Is this your table?
waiter Yeah.
waiter_no_2 God, you're gonna be here all night!
waiter I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!
waiter_no_2 What's the matter with them?
waiter I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. I kinda hope it's the girl. The guy is really cute!
