joey_tribbiani Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.

dr_ross_geller Hey.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
chandler_bing Was it like a sneeze only better?
dr_ross_geller No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
joey_tribbiani What was it?
dr_ross_geller Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Whoa!!!
chandler_bing No!!
dr_ross_geller Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
chandler_bing Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
dr_ross_geller Well what is it? Is it a mole?
joey_tribbiani No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
dr_ross_geller Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
chandler_bing No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a
rachel_green Hey guys! What's...
chandler_bing Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
dr_ross_geller Ahhh.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, right.
phoebe_buffay Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
vince Good deal.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
rachel_green Hi!
chandler_bing Hey!
vince Hey!
phoebe_buffay Vince is a fireman.
rachel_green Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
vince 98 hot saves, highest in the force.
chandler_bing Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
vince Fire safety is not a joke, son.
chandler_bing You're right, I know.
vince Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
rachel_green Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
rachel_green What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
phoebe_buffay I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
joey_tribbiani So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
phoebe_buffay Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Well?!
chandler_bing Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
dr_ross_geller Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
joey_tribbiani Well what is it?!
dr_ross_geller He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
chandler_bing Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
dr_ross_geller At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
joey_tribbiani Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that'd be cool!
monica_geller Pete's breaking up with me.
all@ What?!
monica_geller I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
rachel_green And?
monica_geller Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
monica_geller Really?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
jason ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
phoebe_buffay That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
jason Whoa!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!!!
jason Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
phoebe_buffay No! No!
jason No, no?
phoebe_buffay Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
jason W-w-w-wait! Why?!
phoebe_buffay Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
dr_ross_geller Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
dr_rhodes Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
dr_ross_geller Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
dr_rhodes Well that's not a third nipple.
dr_ross_geller No?
dr_rhodes First of all, it's on your ass.
dr_ross_geller Well then, what is it?!
dr_rhodes Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
dr_johnson#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode23 I'm with Hamilton!
dr_rhodes He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
monica_geller I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
chandler_bing Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
joey_tribbiani Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
phoebe_buffay and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
rachel_green Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
phoebe_buffay Uh.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
phoebe_buffay Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
rachel_green So Pheebs, pick one of them.
monica_geller Yeah. Which one do you like more?
phoebe_buffay Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
joey_tribbiani Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
chandler_bing Well sensitive is important, pick him.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Oh sure, go with the sissy.
phoebe_buffay Jason is not a sissy!
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
dr_ross_geller Y'know I have dinner plans!!

monica_geller Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
pete_becker Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.

dr_ross_geller Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
mrs_becker Hello.
monica_geller And that's Pete's Mom.
rachel_green Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we've got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
monica_geller Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
chandler_bing Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
monica_geller Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
dr_ross_geller Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
rachel_green Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
phoebe_buffay All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
chandler_bing Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
all@ Good luck!
rachel_green OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
phoebe_buffay Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
fireman Oh sure. Vince?!
vince Yo!!
phoebe_buffay Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
vince So, what's up?
phoebe_buffay Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
vince Uh-huh. G-good deal.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry.
vince No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, I didn't
vince I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
phoebe_buffay Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
phoebe_buffay I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
dr_ross_geller Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
monica_geller Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
dr_ross_geller Gimme this.
rachel_green Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
monica_geller Brides magazines?
rachel_green Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
monica_geller It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
rachel_green Oh my God.
monica_geller I know. I need more pie.
phoebe_buffay Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
rachel_green You didn't break up with that fireman?
phoebe_buffay No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
rachel_green Wow!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
monica_geller So then, are you going to dump Jason?
phoebe_buffay Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
phoebe_buffay Jason?
jason Yeah, come on in.
jason So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
phoebe_buffay Nah-ha!
guru_saj You must be Ross.

dr_ross_geller Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
guru_saj Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
dr_ross_geller What's a koondis?
guru_saj I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
dr_ross_geller I guess it's worth a try.
guru_saj Oh sure, we should see results - Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
dr_ross_geller What?! What?!
guru_saj We appear to have angered it.
dr_ross_geller We?! We angered it?!
guru_saj Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
dr_ross_geller Oh God!
guru_saj Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to
dr_ross_geller Ow!!
guru_saj Oops.
dr_ross_geller What was, what was that?

monica_geller Wow.
pete_becker There's one thing missing.
monica_geller What's that?
pete_becker It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
monica_geller Okay.
pete_becker Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
monica_geller You wanna what?!
pete_becker I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
monica_geller What are you talking about?
pete_becker Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
monica_geller And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
pete_becker Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
monica_geller My parents will be so happy.
phoebe_buffay “Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear... ” Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
jason Hey. I was
phoebe_buffay Hey!

vince What?!
jason What?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
vince Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
jason Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
phoebe_buffay Really?!
jason Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
vince You haven't?
jason You have?
phoebe_buffay Well, this is none of my business.
jason I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
phoebe_buffay Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
jason Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
phoebe_buffay Well, that could've been really awkward.
vince You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
vince Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
chandler_bing Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
guru_saj Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
guru_saj Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
