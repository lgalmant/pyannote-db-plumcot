joey WHOAA!!
chandler See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
monica Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
ross Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
monica Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
rachel I didn't know there were docks.
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
ross Aww, is it broken?
joey No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
rachel Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
joey Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
chandler Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just 'fell' out of the socket.
joey What is this? Fruit?
rachel Monica's making jam.
joey Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
chandler Because the kids need new shoes.
monica I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
joey This will just be my batch.
phoebe Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
guy You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
phoebe What?
guy One more chance Ursula, please?
phoebe Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
guy Wh..
phoebe Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
guy Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
phoebe Oh, you're not a dingus.
guy I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
phoebe Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
guy Well thanks.
phoebe Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
guy Not really.
phoebe Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
guy Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
phoebe Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
guy Yeah, okay.
phoebe Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
guy Sorry.
rachel Mon?
ross Mon?
rachel 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
ross Wait a minute, look.
rachel What?
ross Look, look, look.
rachel What, what, what?
ross It's an empty apartment.
rachel Oooh.
ross We're all alone in an empty apartment.
rachel Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
ross There it is.
rachel Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
ross Hey.
chandler Do I look fat?
ross_and_rachel Noo.
chandler Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
rachel Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
chandler Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
ross Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
rachel Nooo!
ross And it works both ways.
chandler Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
rachel Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
ross Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
chandler That's easy, baggage claim.
ross Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
chandler Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
rachel Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
ross Oh.
rachel All right are you guys gonna come down?
ross Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
rachel Good luck Chandler.
chandler Thank you Rachel.
ross Bye sweetie.
rachel Bye hon.
ross Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
chandler Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
ross Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
chandler Yeah.
ross I'm gonna use the cushion.
chandler Yeah.
ross Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
chandler Okay, the old hug and roll.
ross Yep.
chandler Okay, one question.
ross Shoot.
chandler You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
joey Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
rachel You're so pretty.
phoebe Hi!
all Hey, Phoebe.
phoebe Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
joey You talked to him. Are you crazy?
phoebe Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
chandler Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
phoebe Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
ross Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
phoebe No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
joey Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
phoebe Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
monica Hey guys.
all Hey Mon.
monica Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
joey Aww. Ohh!
chandler Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
joey Put your hands together.
monica Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
joey No more jam?!
rachel Well, what happened to your jam plan?
monica I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
chandler Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
ross What are you talking about?
monica I'm talking about me having a baby.
ross What?
rachel Are you serious?
monica Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
ross Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
monica It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
chandler That, that's what's stupid.
monica I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
rachel Down at the docks again?
janice Night-night Bing-a-ling.
chandler Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
malcom Here's my binoculars.
phoebe Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
malcom These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
phoebe Oh, yeah. What's this?
malcom Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
phoebe Um, not even a little bit.
malcom It's about you.
phoebe Oh, okay then.
malcom I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
phoebe Good. So what were you thinking?
malcom I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
phoebe Really?
malcom No.
phoebe Oh.
malcom See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
phoebe Oh, okay.
chandler No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
monica Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
chandler You mean there's more than one of us.
ross Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
monica You're gonna what?
ross I'm gonna tell Mom.
rachel Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
ross Crazy.
monica What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
ross Oh, it's not the ideal way...
monica Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
joey Check it out!! Jam crackers!
monica Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
joey Yeah, the Knicks rule!
monica Joey, this is you!
joey Let me see. Oh, right.
rachel When did you go to a sperm bank?
joey Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
chandler And that's how you bought it?
joey Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
monica Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
joey Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
phoebe Hellooo!
all Hey.
ross How's the maniac?
phoebe Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
rachel Phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
rachel Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
phoebe Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
ross You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
phoebe What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
chandler Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
phoebe What are you saying I should do?
monica I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
phoebe Thank you, Monica.
joey Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
monica Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
rachel Oh my God, what happened?
janice Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
rachel Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
janice Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
rachel Ross's what?
janice You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
malcom Phoebe?
phoebe Yes? Yes! Oh.
malcom What are you doing?
phoebe Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
malcom Were you following me?
phoebe Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
malcom So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
phoebe Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
malcom I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
phoebe No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
malcom Uh-huh, I don't know.
phoebe Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?

monica Hoyt?
joey It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.

joey He's got the body for it.
monica I like that. What?

monica Two girls and a boy?
joey Yeah!
monica And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
