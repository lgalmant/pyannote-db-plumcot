rachel_green That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
chandler_bing I'm sorry!
rachel_green You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
chandler_bing Rachel, wait, wait.
rachel_green No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
chandler_bing Can I just say one thing?
rachel_green What? What?!
chandler_bing That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
rachel_green Oh!!
phoebe_buffay Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
roger That's pretty much it.
phoebe_buffay Oops!
roger But you tell it really well, sweetie.
phoebe_buffay Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
roger Okay. I'll miss you.
phoebe_buffay Isn't he great?
rachel_green He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
phoebe_buffay I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
monica_geller So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
rachel_green Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
chandler_bing Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
rachel_green No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
chandler_bing Okay.
roger Did I, uh, did I miss something?
chandler_bing No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
dr_ross_geller You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
chandler_bing It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
rachel_green Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
rachel_green Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
chandler_bing Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
rachel_green Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
chandler_bing Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
roger You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
chandler_bing Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
roger Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
chandler_bing Huh.
roger I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
chandler_bing Uhhuh, how did you know that?
roger It's textbook.
joey_tribbiani Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
all@ Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
monica_geller Hey, how long are you in the city?
joey_tribbiani_sr Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is my friend Roger.
roger Hi.
joey_tribbiani_sr Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
roger You too, sir.
joey_tribbiani_sr What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
joey_tribbiani Dad, dad.
joey_tribbiani_sr Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
joey_tribbiani_sr Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
joey_tribbiani Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
joey_tribbiani_sr Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
joey_tribbiani Sure. So how long you been...
joey_tribbiani_sr Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
joey_tribbiani Since then?!
joey_tribbiani_sr No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
joey_tribbiani ...I d'know.
joey_tribbiani_sr Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
joey_tribbiani You're one to talk.
joey_tribbiani_sr Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
joey_tribbiani Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
joey_tribbiani_sr Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
joey_tribbiani It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
rachel_green I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
chandler_bing What? What?
rachel_green Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
dr_ross_geller Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
chandler_bing Y'know, I don't see that happening?
rachel_green C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
chandler_bing Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
monica_geller Hello?
phoebe_buffay It's Phoebe.
roger And Rog.
monica_geller C'mon up.
chandler_bing Oh, good. Rog is here.
joey_tribbiani What's the matter with Rog?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
dr_ross_geller What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
dr_ross_geller Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
roger I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
dr_ross_geller Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
roger I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
monica_geller Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
roger Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
dr_ross_geller That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
monica_geller Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
phoebe_buffay Isn't he good?
dr_ross_geller Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
monica_geller Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
dr_ross_geller Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
rachel_green You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
roger That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
roger Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
monica_geller You're welcome.
roger Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
monica_geller Hate that guy!
joey_tribbiani Night, you guys.
chandler_bing Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
joey_tribbiani Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
ronni Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
joey_tribbiani I'm Joey Tribbiani.
ronni Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
chandler_bing Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
ronni Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
chandler_bing Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
ronni That's a good one!
joey_tribbiani_sr Hey, Joe.
joey_tribbiani Dad, Ronni's here.
joey_tribbiani_sr Huh?
ronni Hi.
joey_tribbiani_sr Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
ronni Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
joey_tribbiani_sr Thank you. Uh...
chandler_bing So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
ronni Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
joey_tribbiani_sr I don't want you taking that thing.
ronni Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
joey_tribbiani Who-ah-ho.
joey_tribbiani_sr We'll go to a hotel.
ronni We'll go to a hotel.
joey_tribbiani No you won't.
ronni No we won't.
joey_tribbiani If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
joey_tribbiani_sr You're gonna keep an eye on us?
joey_tribbiani That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
ronni Wow. He's strict.
joey_tribbiani Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
ronni Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
chandler_bing C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
joey_tribbiani Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
joey_tribbiani_sr What kinda change?
joey_tribbiani Well, either you break it off with Ronni
joey_tribbiani_sr I can't do that!
joey_tribbiani Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
joey_tribbiani_sr Yeah, but this is
joey_tribbiani I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
chandler_bing Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
joey_tribbiani Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
chandler_bing Well, you're gonna.
joey_tribbiani I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
chandler_bing Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
joey_tribbiani Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
chandler_bing Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
joey_tribbiani No.
chandler_bing No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
joey_tribbiani You really think so?
chandler_bing Yeah. I really do.
joey_tribbiani Thanks, Chandler.
chandler_bing Get off!
ronni Hi.
monica_geller Hi...May I help you?
ronni Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
monica_geller Okay...who are you?
ronni Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
monica_geller Oh, c'mon in.
ronni Thanks.
rachel_green Hi, I'm Rachel.
ronni Hi.
rachel_green Bathroom's up there.
ronni Great.
rachel_green Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
ronni Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
rachel_green Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
joey_tribbiani_sr Hey. Morning, dear.
rachel_green Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
joey_tribbiani What's the matter with you?!
rachel_green I thought it was Chandler!
chandler_bing What? What?
rachel_green You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
chandler_bing Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
all@ Hey, Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller How's it going?
phoebe_buffay Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
phoebe_buffay So what's going on?
monica_geller Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
dr_ross_geller I dunno, there's just something about...
chandler_bing Basically we just feel that he's...
rachel_green We hate that guy.
all@ Yeah. Hate him.
dr_ross_geller We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
all@ ...No, we hate him.
rachel_green We're sorry.
joey_tribbiani Ma! What're you doing here?
gloria_tribbiani I came to give you this and this.
joey_tribbiani Oww! Big ring!
gloria_tribbiani Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
joey_tribbiani Hold on, you-you knew?
gloria_tribbiani Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
joey_tribbiani So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
gloria_tribbiani Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
joey_tribbiani Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
gloria_tribbiani Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
joey_tribbiani I'm...happy...for you?
gloria_tribbiani Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
joey_tribbiani Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
gloria_tribbiani I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
gloria_tribbiani That's sweet. Could I take her?
joey_tribbiani With this ring? No contest.
roger What's wrong, sweetie?
phoebe_buffay Nothing, nothing.
roger Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
phoebe_buffay It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
roger Oh. They don't.
phoebe_buffay But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
roger What?
phoebe_buffay Intense and creepy.
roger Oh.
phoebe_buffay But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
roger Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
phoebe_buffay You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
roger Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
monica_geller So you talked to your dad, huh.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
rachel_green Wow.
chandler_bing Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
dr_ross_geller So Joey, you okay?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
rachel_green Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
chandler_bing If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
all@ Hey, Pheebs.
monica_geller How's it going?
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
all@ Awww.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, right.
all@ Aaawwwwww!!
rachel_green What happened?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Joey. What's going on?
joey_tribbiani Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop
monica_geller Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
joey_tribbiani Sorry. Wrong boobies.
monica_geller Hello, Joey.
joey_tribbiani_sr Oh! ...Hello, dear.
