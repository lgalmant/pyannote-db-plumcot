joey Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
chandler Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
joey Huh?!
chandler Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
joey Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
chandler Could we be more white trash?
monica How desperate am I?
rachel Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
monica I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
phoebe How come?
monica Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
ross Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
monica You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
rachel Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
joey Just pickle.
chandler Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
rachel My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
chandler Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
rachel You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
chandler No. No!
joanna Hello, Rachel.
chandler Well, not at first.
rachel What is she doing here?
rachel I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
chandler Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
rachel Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
chandler Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
rachel Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
chandler Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
rachel Thank you.
chandler I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
joey Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
mrs_geller How's the hired help?
monica Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
mrs_geller What's this? Blue nail polish?
monica Yeah, I thought it was cute.
mrs_geller Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
monica Let me ask you a question.
mrs_geller Hmm.
monica Why did you hire me?
mrs_geller Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
monica Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
phoebe Okay, I didn't hear that.
monica Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
phoebe Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
the_salesman Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
joey Uhhhh.
the_salesman Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
joey No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
the_salesman Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
ross ...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
monica ...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
all Nooo!!
chandler ...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
the_salesman Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
joey Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
phoebe That's weird.
monica What?
phoebe Your nails.
monica Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
phoebe Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
monica Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
phoebe Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
mrs_geller Honey, don't bite your nails.
monica Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
phoebe And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
mrs_geller I'm not freaking out.
monica Then why are you laughing?
mrs_geller It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
monica What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
mrs_geller Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
monica Frozen lasagnas?
mrs_geller Um-hmm.
monica You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was
mrs_geller No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
monica You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
mrs_geller Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
monica That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
phoebe I don't get it.
mrs_geller No, I have faith
monica No! You have lasagnas!
oven Ding!
phoebe Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
chandler It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
joanna No, we are. I'm sad.
chandler Okay.
joanna Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
chandler Thanks.
joanna No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
chandler Okay.
joanna What are you doing?
chandler I'm getting dressed.
joanna Why?
chandler When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
joanna Wait. I wanna show you something.
chandler What is it?
joanna Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
chandler Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
joanna I'll be back in ten minutes.
chandler You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
joanna Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
chandler Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
joanna Oh.
sophie Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
joanna Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
rachel That's weird, she locked the door.
sophie Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
rachel Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
sophie Yeah!
chandler Hi! How are you?
chandler Hello, Joanna......'s office.
joanna I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
chandler How little?!
joanna A couple of hours, I feel awful.
chandler Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
joanna I can't!!
chandler Why not?!
joanna I'm in my boss's car!
chandler What?!
joanna Uh-oh, tunnel.
rachel What?!
chandler Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
chandler Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
rachel You promised you would break up with her!
chandler I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
rachel And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
chandler It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
rachel Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
chandler No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
rachel Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
chandler Never!
rachel You never come into this office again!
chandler Fine!
rachel You give me back my Walkman!
chandler I-never borrowed your Walkman.
rachel Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
chandler You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
rachel Does it hurt?
chandler No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
rachel Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
chandler About what?
rachel When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
chandler I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
rachel No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
chandler Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
chandler Well, this is much better.
the_salesman So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
joey He cut off his ear.
the_salesman And?
joey I'm out.
the_salesman He painted that.
joey Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
the_salesman Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
joey In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
the_salesman Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
joey Spock's birth control.
the_salesman You need these books.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hi.
phoebe This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
monica Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
phoebe Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
monica Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
phoebe No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
monica What?
phoebe Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
monica All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
phoebe Wow! My breasts are really strong.
rachel Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
chandler Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
rachel What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
chandler It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
rachel Foot rubs for a month!
chandler Freedom!
rachel I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
chandler Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
rachel Sophie sit!!
rachel No! God, would you just calm down!
chandler I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just
joey Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
the_salesman So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
joey Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
the_salesman Well ah, what can you swing?
joey How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
the_salesman You don't have, anything?
joey You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
the_salesman Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
joey And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
the_salesman For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
joey Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
rachel I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
chandler No!
rachel I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
chandler With extra pulp?
rachel Yeah!!
chandler No!
rachel D'oh!! I've got it!
chandler You don't have it.
rachel I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
chandler How do Monica and Phoebe know?
rachel Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
chandler Go on.
rachel I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
chandler And Milton Berle has a
rachel Ohh, not compared to you.
monica Well?
phoebe They're not even touching the lasagna!
monica Really?!
phoebe Oh, they love your casserole.
monica Yes!!
phoebe It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
mrs_geller Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
monica And you?
mrs_geller I thought it was... quite tasty.
monica So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you
mrs_geller A bitch?
monica Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
mrs_geller Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
monica Wow!
phoebe Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
mrs_geller And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
monica That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
chandler Hello.
joey_rachel_and_ross Hey!
monica Hello, Chandler.
chandler I love you.
joey Wh-what's going on?
phoebe Oh.
joey No he doesn't!
chandler Two hours, that lasted!
rachel So did you break up with Joanna?
chandler I think so.
joey Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
ross The volcano?
joey Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
rachel What?!
joey Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
monica Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
joey Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
monica Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
all Oh, yeah. Yeah.
phoebe Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
ross With such a sad history.
chandler Could there be more Kims?
joanna Who's out there?
rachel It's me! Good morning!
joanna Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
rachel Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
joanna I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
rachel Oh, yeah! Yeah!
joanna You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
rachel Okay.
