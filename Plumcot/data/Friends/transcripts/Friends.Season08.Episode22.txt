dr_ross_geller Hey! What are you guys looking at?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
dr_ross_geller Now I cannot wait to see this.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
phoebe_buffay I started that!
joey_tribbiani I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you're all invited!
monica_geller Are we gonna take a limo?
joey_tribbiani Sure! Why not?!
monica_geller Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
rachel_green Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
rachel_green That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
dr_ross_geller Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
rachel_green You. Like you haven't done enough.
dr_ross_geller Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
rachel_green God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
phoebe_buffay Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end
rachel_green Oh Phoebe, that's a great story. Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea? Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
chandler_bing Let's.
chandler_bing Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
rachel_green Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
monica_geller What are you doing here so early?
rachel_green They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y'know what? Screw 'em! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys.
phoebe_buffay Or you can do volunteer work.
joey_tribbiani Hello?
estelle_leonard Joey! It's Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
joey_tribbiani One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
estelle_leonard Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
estelle_leonard Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? Hello?
joey_tribbiani Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
rachel_green What-what about me?
joey_tribbiani You said you didn't want to go.
rachel_green I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.
joey_tribbiani Definitely not invisible.
monica_geller Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
chandler_bing He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.
monica_geller Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
chandler_bing I haven't seen this dress.
monica_geller Star in a movie.
phoebe_buffay Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe.
joey_tribbiani Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!
chandler_bing You really want to take me?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
chandler_bing So you're never actually going to pay me back?
monica_geller Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
joey_tribbiani It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.
chandler_bing I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
joey_tribbiani Thanks. That means a lot to me.
phoebe_buffay Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna go shave.
chandler_bing Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
rachel_green Oh, I have to pee. If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
phoebe_buffay When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her.
monica_geller She's over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
monica_geller Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
phoebe_buffay You're on!
monica_geller Okay, how much?
phoebe_buffay One hundred thousand dollars!
monica_geller How about fifty bucks?
phoebe_buffay Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
rachel_green All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
phoebe_buffay No one's here! Oh damnit!
chandler_bing This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
joey_tribbiani A little tall.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go.
chandler_bing It's just so glamorous.
phoebe_buffay Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
rachel_green Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
monica_geller Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
phoebe_buffay It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
monica_geller Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
phoebe_buffay Fine! You're on!
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
dr_ross_geller Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
monica_geller She's in the bathroom.
dr_ross_geller Rach, we gotta go.
rachel_green In a minute!!!
dr_ross_geller People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
rachel_green All right, all right. Let's go!
dr_ross_geller Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
rachel_green No, I'm fine.
dr_ross_geller Really? You don't think that's a little inappropriate.
phoebe_buffay Good God man don't anger it.
rachel_green Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
dr_ross_geller Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
rachel_green Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
monica_geller I'm actually with her on this one.
joey_tribbiani "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
joey_tribbiani Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
rachel_green Ross.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
rachel_green Can I ask you something?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh.
rachel_green When Carol was pregnant with Ben
dr_ross_geller Mmm?
rachel_green ...were you this irritating?
dr_ross_geller Wow!
rachel_green Excuse me?!
dr_ross_geller Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
rachel_green Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
rachel_green Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
dr_ross_geller Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
rachel_green Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
dr_ross_geller Oh, you're nice to her.
rachel_green She has the drugs!
dr_long We'll do a quick check.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_long So, eight days late huh?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_long You must be a little uncomfortable.
rachel_green Eh, just a tad.
dr_long You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
dr_ross_geller Do them!!
dr_long Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.
rachel_green Well, we are ready to try anything.
dr_long Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_long You can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods
rachel_green Great! We will do all of those.
dr_long ...taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.
dr_ross_geller You've got to be kidding me!
chandler_bing Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
joey_tribbiani You liked it? You really liked it?
chandler_bing Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
joey_tribbiani Which part exactly?
chandler_bing The whole thing! Can we go?
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
chandler_bing I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
joey_tribbiani Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
chandler_bing I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
joey_tribbiani You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
chandler_bing Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
rachel_green No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
rachel_green Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, "That will open up a can of worms."
monica_geller Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
dr_ross_geller It's sex.
monica_geller Do it!
dr_ross_geller Monica!
monica_geller I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
phoebe_buffay Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
monica_geller All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
dr_ross_geller Monica, what is the matter with you?
monica_geller Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
rachel_green Why? Why today?
monica_geller Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
dr_ross_geller What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
rachel_green I'll take that bet.
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
dr_ross_geller Can I get some of that action?
monica_geller Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
rachel_green Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
monica_geller Oh, okay!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Sleeping beauty!
chandler_bing Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
joey_tribbiani Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
chandler_bing I'm so sorry.
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
chandler_bing You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money
joey_tribbiani Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
chandler_bing I don't know, five hundred dollars?
joey_tribbiani Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
chandler_bing Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
joey_tribbiani Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's
chandler_bing Do you want a calculator?
joey_tribbiani Please!
chandler_bing Here!
joey_tribbiani All right, what else?
chandler_bing Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes
joey_tribbiani Which we're still keeping under our hats!
chandler_bing Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
joey_tribbiani What the hell are you talking about, "The south will rise again man."
chandler_bing Yes, money well spent!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
chandler_bing Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
joey_tribbiani Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
dr_ross_geller Come on, finish your enchilada.
rachel_green Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
dr_ross_geller Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha... Oh God! So...so hot! Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
rachel_green I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
dr_ross_geller Stop it.
rachel_green Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
rachel_green Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
dr_ross_geller This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
rachel_green Make love? What are you a girl?
dr_ross_geller Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
rachel_green But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
dr_ross_geller I love when you talk dirty to me.
rachel_green Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh...Oh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!
dr_ross_geller Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
rachel_green Come on Ross! I'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what?
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Forget it.
rachel_green Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!
dr_ross_geller I'm getting that baby out of you!
rachel_green Oh God!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I know.
rachel_green Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
dr_ross_geller I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
rachel_green Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller We're having a baby.
rachel_green I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to
dr_ross_geller Not so much.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Two hundred.
phoebe_buffay Thank you!
monica_geller That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
phoebe_buffay Is Rachel having the baby?
monica_geller How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
phoebe_buffay They're at the coffeehouse.
monica_geller You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl.
phoebe_buffay We know it's a girl!
monica_geller I'll give you really good odds.
