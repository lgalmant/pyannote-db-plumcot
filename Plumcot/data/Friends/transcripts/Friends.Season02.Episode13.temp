trainer Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
rachel Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
trainer In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
all Woah.
chandler So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
directors_assistant Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?

susie We've got a problem.
directors_assistant Tell me.
susie I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
directors_assistant Is it bad?
susie It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
directors_assistant I'll talk to her.
susie I hate actors.
chandler Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
susie Excuse me.
chandler Ahhhh.
susie Uh, is your name Chandler?
chandler Uh, yes, yes it is.
susie Chandler Bing?
chandler Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
susie I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
chandler Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. great job growing up.
susie It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
chandler Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
susie Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
chandler Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
monica Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
rachel What what what what?
monica Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
rachel Ya think?
monica The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see
rachel No, was he any good in it?
monica Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
rachel Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
monica Oh, yeah.
rachel What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
monica He could hear me.
rachel OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
monica Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't,
rachel Excuse me. Hi.
van_damme Hi.
rachel Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
van_damme You don't think I'm cute?
rachel I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
van_damme You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
chandler No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
susie OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
chandler OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
susie Oh that's me, I gotta go.
chandler Oh uh, o, OK.
susie Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
chandler Well, uh, let's try one more. there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
susie I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
chandler No one was around to hear that?
monica So what'd he say?
rachel Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
monica Well, thanks anyway.
rachel He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
monica Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
rachel Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
rachel And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
joey Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. no guys around, huh.
rachel Does anybody need anything?
monica Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
rachel That is so unfair.
phoebe I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
ross Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
joey You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
ross Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
joey Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
chandler Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
phoebe Stick a fork what?

phoebe Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
chandler OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
chandler I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
monica What did you say?
chandler Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
phoebe Oh, you just know.
susie Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.

susie Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
susie But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
chandler Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
susie Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
chandler You want me to wear your panties?
susie Could ya?
chandler Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. You're swell.
